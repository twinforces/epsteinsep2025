Hernandez, 85 F.3d lo23, lo3o (2d Cir.\nl996) (cleaned up). Courts in this District generally\ndelay ruling on any motion to strike until after the\npresentation of the Government’s evidence at trial,\nbecause that evidence may affect hou specific allega-\ntions relate to the overall charges. See, eg., United\nStates v. Nejad, No. l8-cr-224 (AJN), 2ol9 WL\n67o236l, at *l8 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 6, 2ol9); United States\nv. Mostafa, 965 F. Supp. 2d 45l, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8).\n\nMaxwell contends that the allegations related to\n“Minor Victim-3” are surplusage because the indictment\ndoes not charge that Minor Victim-3 traveled in\ninterstate commerce or was belou the age of consent\nin England where the alleged activities took place.\nThus, she argues, these allegations do not relate to the\ncharged conspiracy and instead reflect an atempt to\nintroduce Minor Victim-3’s testimony for impermissible\npurposes.\n\nThe Court will not strike any language from the Sl\nsuperseding indictment at this juncture. The standard\nunder Rule 7(d) is “exacting” and requires the\ndefendant to demonstrate clearly that the allegations\nare irrelevant to the crimes charged. United States v.\nNapolitano, 552 F. Supp. 465, 48o (S.D.N.Y. l982). The\nindictment does not allege that the alleged victim\ntraveled in interstate commerce or was underage\nduring sexual encounters with Epstein. But the\nCourt cannot rule out that the allegations may reflect\nconduct undertaken in furtherance of the charged\nconspiracy or be relevant to prove facts such as\nMaxwell’s state of mind.

See United States v. Boustani, 356 F. Supp. 3d 246, 257 (E.D.N.Y.\n2ol9). “This is why, as the Government correctly notes, federal prisoners should be detained in\nfacilities run by trained personnel from federal correctional facilities.” /d. at 258 (citing Sabhnani,\n493 F.3d at 74 n.l3 (“To the extent [armed private guards] implies an expectation that deadly force\nmay need to be used to assure defendant['s] presence at trial ...

United\nStates v. Banki, 369 Fed. App’x l52, l53-54 (2d Cir. 2olo). In the same decision, the Second\nCircuit noted that it was “troubled” by the possibility of “allou[ing] wealthy defendants to buy\ntheir way out by constructing a private jail.” (internal quotation marks omited)). /d.; accord, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Cilins, No. l3 Cr. 3l5 (WHP), 2ol3 WL 38o2ol2, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July l9, 2ol3)\n(““‘it is contrary to underlying principles of detention and release on bail that individuals otherwise\nineligible for release should be able to buy their way out by constructing a private jail, policed by\nsecurity guards not trained or ultimately accountable to the Government, even if carefully\nselected’” (quoting Borodin v. Ashcroft, l36 F. Supp. 2d l25, l34 (E.D.N.Y. 2ool))); Valerio, 9\nF. Supp. 3d at 293-94 (E.D.N.Y. 2ol4) (“There is nothing in the Bail Reform Act that would\nsuggest that a defendant (or even, hypothetically, a group of defendants with private funding) has\na statutory right to replicate or construct a private jail in a home or some other location.”).\n\nThe defendant’s payment of his guards also raises the conflict of interest inherent in having\nthe defendant having extraordinary influence over a private security company tasked with guarding\nhim, leaving the company’s incentives entirely aligned with the defendant. See, e.g., Boustani,\n356 F. Supp. 3d at 257 (in finding that private armed guards would not reasonably assure the\nappearance of a defendant, noting a “clear conflict of interest—private prison guards paid by an\ninmate” and noting that in a recent S.D.N.Y. case involving private security guards the defendant\n“was outside of his apartment virtually all day, every weekday; was visited by a masseuse for a\ntotal of l6o hours in a 3o-day period; and went on an unauthorized visit to a restaurant in\nChinatoun with his private guards in tou”); see also United States v. Tajideen, l7 Cr. o46, 2ol8\nWL l342475, at *5-6 (D.D.C. Mar. l5, 2ol8) (finding Zarrab “particularly instructive” and further\nnoting: “While the Court has no reason to believe that the individuals selected for the <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span>\nsecurity detail would intentionally violate federal law and assist the defendant in fleeing the Court's\njurisdiction, it nonetheless is mindful of the pouer of money and its potential to corrupt or\nundermine laudable objectives. And although these realities cannot control the Court's ruling, they\nalso cannot be absolutely discounted or ignored.”).\n\nFinally, in Zarrab this Court found that “the Defendant’s privately funded armed guard\nproposal is unreasonable because it helps to foster inequity and unequal treatment in favor of a\nvery small cohort of criminal defendants who are extremely wealthy, such as Mr. Zarrab.” 2ol6\nWL 368l423, at *l3; see also Boustani, 356 F.

As a result, we join with the recommendation from\n\nl5 pretrial services and the requests of the victims that the\n\nl6 defendant be detained.\n\nl7 As the Court pointed out, with the sex trafficking\n\nl8 offense charged here, there is a presumption that no\n\nl9 combination of release conditions could reasonably assure the\n2o <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> appearance and the protection of the public.\n2l The Court asked whether the presumption has been\n22 rebuted, and the answer is no. There has been no information\n23 provided by the defendant to rebut that presumption in this\n24 case.\n25 And in particular, as the Court noted, the defendant\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo52o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000522.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 36_ Filed o7/24/l9 Page l2 of 74 l2\n\nl clear from his willingness to tamper with witnesses and victims\n2 as the Court can see from the two police reports produced to\n\n3 the Court and from the <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> payments just months ago to\n4 individuals associated with the defendant during the relevant\n\n5 time. The Court asked a question about that.\n\n6 Your Honor, we just became aware of those payments\n\n7 late last week.

And most of all, he is an extraordinary\nl7 flight risk. As the government has discussed, he has six\n\nl8 homes. He ouns two private islands. He ouns a residence in\n\nl9 France. And he has told his oun financial institution that he\n2o is worth more than $5oo million.\n2l In the government's filing last Monday, we described\n22 the defendant as being extraordinarily wealthy which was\n23 confirmed by the defense even in his very minimal financial\n24 disclosure.\n25 Since the government's initial filing, we have\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo522", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000524.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document36_ Filed o7/24/l9 Page l4 of 74 La\n\nl Your Honor, with a case that's no longer covert, we\n\n2 have been able to dramatically expand the scope of our\n\n3 investigation in just the last week. And that additional\n\n4 evidence builds on a case that was already indicted by a grand\n5 jury, that already included evidence of dozens of alleged\n\n6 victims, that already included significant corroborated\n\n7 evidence, evidence that led to the charges for which this\n\n8 66-year-old defendant could serve up to 45 years in prison.\n\n9 The defendant has essentially conceded that the\n\nlo government will be able to prove the elements of the crimes\n\nll currently alleged.

A Court does not need to find both bases are proven to order a defendant’s\ni\n\ndetention. See id.; United States v. Blanco, 57o F. App’x 76, 78 (2d Cir. 2ol4). Dangerousness\nmeans that the defendant is a “danger to the safety of any other person or the community.” l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42. A finding of dangerousness must be supported by clear and convincing evidence.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 54o, 542 (2d Cir. l995). “Where there is a strong\nprobability that a person will commit additional crimes if released, the need to protect the |\ncommunity becomes sufficiently compelling that detention is, on balance, appropriate.” United\nStates v. Chimurenga, 76o F.2d 4oo, 4o3 (2d Cir. l985). “[E]ven a single incident of witness\ntampering . . . [may be] sufficient to revoke bail.” LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d at l34.\n\nTo order detention based upon risk of flight, the Court must find by a preponderance of\n\nthe evidence that “that no conditions could reasonably assure the <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> presence at trial.” |\nSee, e.g., United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. l987); l8 U.S.C. § 3l42. “[T]he |\n\nconstitutional limits on a detention period based on dangerousness to the community may be\n\nlooser than the limits on a detention period based solely on risk of flight. In the former case,\n\nrelease risks injury to others, while in the later case, release risks only the loss of a conviction.”\n\nUnited States v. Millan, 4 F.3d lo38, lo48 (2d Cir. l993) (quoting United States v. Orena, 986\n\nF.2d 628, 63l (2d Cir. l993)). A bail package that “may reasonably assure the appearance of [the\n\ndefendant] at trial will not [necessarily] assure the safety of the community.” United States v.\n\nRodriguez, 95o F.2d 85, 89 (2d Cir. l99l).\n\nThe Bail Reform Act sets forth the follouing four factors to be considered in the\nrelease/remand analysis: (l) the nature and circumstances of the crime(s) charged; (2) the weight |\nof the evidence against the person; (3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including\nthe person’s character and financial resources; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo79l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000825.jpg": "Case l9-222l, Document 4-2, o7/23/2ol9, 26l468l, Page8 of 8\n\no7/l6/2ol9 | 24 | LETTER RESPONSE in Support of Motion by Jeffrey Epstein addressed to Judge\nRichard M.

The Court firmly expects that\ncounsel for all involved parties will exercise great care to ensure compliance with this\nCourt's local rules, including Local Criminal Rule 23.l, and the rules of professional\nresponsibility. In light of this clear expectation, the Court does not believe that further\naction is needed at this time to protect the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> right to a fair trial by an\nimpartial jury. Accordingly, it denies the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> motion without prejudice. But\nthe Court warns counsel and agents for the parties and counsel for potential witnesses\nthat going forward it will not hesitate to take appropriate action in the face of\nviolations of any relevant rules.

These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial.

On February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its\nomnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants’ twelve pretrial motions. It filed\nthe brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the\nCourt's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See\nDkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket\non ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file\na leter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding\npages ll28 and l87l88 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2o2l. The\nparties are further ORDERED to meet, confer, and jointly propose redactions to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> cover leter objecting to the Government's proposed redactions by March\n22, 2o2l.

(Sternheim, Bobbi) (Entered: o3/23/2o2l)\n\no3/24/2o2l | l72 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing.

Due to social distancing requirements,\nseating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional persons will\nbe admited. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID—l9 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who\nappears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the\nproceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their\ntemperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions,\natached.

There are no exceptions. As\ndiscussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the\nWaiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the\nproceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form\n(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-—l74 of March 27,\n2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24\nhours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.\" Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4).

So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district.

These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment.

(Comey, Maurene)\n(Entered: l2/o2/2o2o)\n\nl2/o3/2o2o 8l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span>\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions.

On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing.

It is difficult to believe that that was a forthcoming\nl8 answer because it is implausible on its face and very\n\nl9 confusing, but the government has continued to investigate the\n2o circumstances surrounding the purchase of that New Hampshire\n2l property.\n22 This morning, your Honor, I spoke with an F.B.I. agent\n23 who recently interviewed a real estate agent involved in that\n24 transaction in New Hampshire.

In other words, even though, as defense claims,\n\n2 that she is widely knoun, that there is press everywhere, she\n\n3 was able to pass during the purchase of a real estate\n\n4 transaction under a fake name and not be detected.

Second, we request that the\nCourt enter an order directing the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) to release Ms. Maxwell into the\ngeneral population and provide Ms. Maxwell with increased access to the discovery materials\nwhile she is detained so that she can meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense.\n\nl. _ Disclosure of Victim Identities\n\nThe Court should order the government to disclose the identities of Victims l-3 to\ndefense counsel, subject to the restrictions of the protective order, because Ms. Maxwell cannot\nprepare for or receive a fair trial without this information. Moreover, the requested disclosure is\nauthorized under the law in this Circuit, and is narrouly-tailored and reasonable under the\ncircumstances of this case.\n\nHere, it is clear from the face of the indictment that the government’s case is based on the\naccounts of Victims l-3, the three individuals specifically referenced in the indictment.

Go ahead.\n\nl8 MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor.\n\nl9 It appears that the defendant has insufficient ties to\n2o motivate her to remain in the United States. With respect to\n2l her family circumstances, she does not have children, she does\n22 not appear to reside with any immediate family members, and she\n23 doesn't have any employment that would require her to remain in\n24 the United States.\n25 But, by contrast, she has extensive international\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool9o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001906.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 29 of 9l 29\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl simply implausible that the defendant simply has a lump set of\n2 assets and no other stream of income, especially given the\n\n3 lifestyle that she has been living and as detailed in the\n\n4 Pretrial Services report.

As one example, the defendant told\n\nl4 Pretrial Services that the New Hampshire property was ouned by\nl5 a corporation, that she does not knou the name of the\n\nl6 corporation, but that she was just permited to stay in the\n\nl7 house. It is difficult to believe that that was a forthcoming\nl8 answer because it is implausible on its face and very\n\nl9 confusing, but the government has continued to investigate the\n2o circumstances surrounding the purchase of that New Hampshire\n2l property.\n22 This morning, your Honor, I spoke with an F.B.I. agent\n23 who recently interviewed a real estate agent involved in that\n24 transaction in New Hampshire.

Janet Marshall described herself as a journalist who\n\nS wants privacy. they told the agent they wanted to purchase the\n6 property quickly through a wire and that they were seting up\n\n7 an LLC.

Your\n8 Honor, follouing the <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> arrest, the real estate agent\n9 saw a photograph of the defendant in the media and realized\n\nlo that the person who had introduced herself as Janet Marshall,\nll who had toured the house and participated in these\n\nl2 conversations about the purchase, was the defendant, Ghislaine\nl3 Maxwell.\n\nl4 That series of facts, which I just learned about this\nl5 morning, your Honor, are concerning for two reasons. First,\n\nl6 additionally, it appears that the defendant has atempted to\n\nl7 conceal an asset from the court, and at the very least she has\nl8 not been forthcoming in the course of her Pretrial Services\n\nl9 interview; and, second, it appears that the defendant has used\n2o an alias and that she was willing to lie to hide herself and\n2l hide her identity and we discussed the additional indicia in\n22 our briefing your Honor. So that raises real concerns.\n23 Moreover, the <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> claims about her finances to\n24 Pretrial Services should be concerning to the court for\n25 additional reasons.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool9o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001908.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 3l of 9l 3l\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl THE COURT: I'm sorry, Ms. Moe, if I may pause you\n\n2 before moving on from those points.\n\n3 There is a basic dispute within the papers as to, I\n\n4 think, efforts similar to the ones you have described that are\niy efforts to hide from authorities, which would certainly be an\n\n6 indication of risk of flight or whether, in light of the\n\n7 notoriety and public interest that the case has generated\n\n8 follouing the indictment of Mr. Epstein, whether it was an\n\n9 effort to protect privacy and hide from press for privacy\n\nlo reasons.\n\nll Hou does the government suggest that that factual\n\nl2 determination be resolved, if you agree that it should, and\n\nl3 what is your general response to the veracity of that\n\nl4 assertion?\n\nl5 MS.

In other words, even though, as defense claims,\n\n2 that she is widely knoun, that there is press everywhere, she\n\n3 was able to pass during the purchase of a real estate\n\n4 transaction under a fake name and not be detected. So there\n\n5 really can be no question that the defendant is willing to lie\n6 about who she is, that she can live in hiding, that she has the\n7 means to do so. All of those things should be extremely\n\n8 concerning to the court, your Honor, as the court evaluates\n\n9 whether the defendant has the ability and willingness to live\nlo off the grid indefinitely. A year is an extremely long period\nll of time to live in hiding, undetected by the public. And so\n\nl2 all of those things are concerning.\n\nl3 With respect to the question of motive, your Honor,\n\nl4 the government submits the court need not reach that ultimate\nl5 issue, but we noted, your Honor, that there are indicia during\nl6 the circumstances of the <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> arrest that suggested that\nl7 there was a motive to evade detection by law enforcement.

We submit\nll there are concerns there for two reasons, your Honor.\n\nl2 The first is that we learned that records relating --\nl3 reflecting to client information for a SWIFT bank include\nl4 self-reported financial information from the defendant. In\nl5 other words, when the account was opened, there were\nl6 disclosures made about the <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> finances.

And both her net worth and liquid assets\n2o are listed as ranging from $lo million and above.\n2l Second, as we noted in our reply, the defendant is the\n22 grantor of a trust account in the same SWIFT bank with assets\n23 of more than $4 million as of last month. Bank documents\n24 reflect that the trust has three trustees, one of whom has the\n25 authority to act independently.

There is no mention of the\n\nl3 <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> finances and no effort to address those concerns\n\nl4 whatsoever.\n\nl5 In sum, your Honor, the court has been given virtually\nl6 no information about the <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> possession of and apparent\nl7 access to extensive wealth. The court should not take that\n\nl8 concealment, your Honor, we respectfully submit, as an\n\nl9 invitation to demand further details, but instead to recognize\n2o that if the court can't rely on this defendant to be\n2l transparent at this basic initial stage, the court cannot rely\n22 on her to return to court if released. In short, she has not\n23 earned the court's trust.\n24 Finally, your Honor, turning to the <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span>\n25 proposed bail package, in light of all of the red flags here —--\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool9l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001913.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 36 of 9l 36\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl the <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> demonstrated willingness and ability to live in\n2 hiding, her ability to live comfortably beyond the reach of\n\ni) extradition, her strong interactional ties and lack of\n\n4 community ties, significant and unexplained wealth, and the\n\n5 presumption of detention in light of very serious charges -- in\n6 light of all that, your Honor, it is extremely surprising that\n7 the defendant would propose a bail package with virtually no\n\n8 security whatsoever.\n\n9 In addition to failing to describe in any way the\n\nlo absence of proposed cosigners of a bond, the defendant also\n\nll makes no mention whatsoever about the financial circumstances\nl2 or assets of her spouse whose her identity she declined to\n\nl3 provide to Pretrial Services.

She identifies no stable residence where she could\n22 reside. Instead, she proposes, among other proposals, that she\n23 stay at a luxury hotel in Manhatan, the most transient type of\n24 residence.

This information is coming out in\n\nl2 dribs and drabs, and defendant should not be in a position to\nl3 slouly but surely concede, as the government reveals, that she\nl4 has been less than candid with the court about her finances.\n\nl5 There are serious concerns here.\n\nl6 With respect to the notion that the defendant could\n\nl7 just surrender her passports, there are of course no\n\nl8 limitations this court could set on a foreign government\n\nl9 issuing travel documents to defendant or accepting her if she\n2o were to enter into that country.\nal And finally, your Honor, with respect to the case law\n22 that defense has cited, they ignore the obvious comparator\n23 case, which is Judge Berman's decision regarding Jeffrey\n24 Epstein, who was arrested both on risk of flight grounds and on\n25 dangerousness grounds.

At this\n\n5 point, your Honor, the defense has articulated no legal basis\n\n6 to suggest that the defendant is shielded by the nonprosecution\n7 agreement, and it simoly doesn't make sense that the decision\n\n8 in this case is somehou tactical to avoid concerns about the\n\n9 NPA, when the government charged Jeffrey Epstein with conduct\nlo that fell within the scope of the time period within the\n\nll nonprosecution agreement and stated before the court in\n\nl2 connection with bail proceedings in that mater that this is\n\nl3 the government's strong view that that agreement does not bind\nl4 this office whatsoever with respect to any kind of conduct or\nl5 any kind of individual. That agreement does not bind this\n\nl6 office whatsoever.\n\nl7 Your Honor, in short, it is important for the court to\nl8 evaluate the question of bail given the totality of the\n\nl9 circumstances. The defense's argument, in essence, atempts to\n2o view each of the government's arguments as absolute. But when\n2l you review the totality of the circumstances -- the <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span>\n22 extensive international ties, her conduct over the past year,\n23 her unknoun finances and unwillingness to be more candid with\n24 the court about her resources to flee, her specific bail\n25 proposal which provides absolutely no security to the court --\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool95l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001952.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 75 of 9l 75\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl it is clear that defendant has not met her burden to rebut the\n2 presumption of detention in this case.

In other words, her federal indictment may\n\ni) well change her earlier decisions and, given the <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span>\n\n4 resources, the court concludes that Ms. Maxwell poses a\n\n5 substantial actual risk of flight.\n\n6 Having made this determination, the court next turns\n\n7 to whether the government has met its burden to shou by a\n\n8 preponderance of the evidence that no combination of conditions\n9 could reasonably assure the <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> presence. The court is\nlo persuaded that the government has met this burden and concludes\nll that even the most restrictive conditions of release would be\nl2 insufficient.\n\nl3 As an initial mater, the financial component of\n\nl4 Ms. Maxwell's proposed bail package appears to represent a\n\nl5 relatively small component of the access available to her and\nl6 is secured only by a foreign property said to be worth about\n\nl7 several million dollars. But even a substantially larger\n\nl8 package would be insufficient. The extent of her financial\n\nl9 resources is demonstrated by some of the transactions and bank\n2o accounts discussed in the government's submission and here\n2l today, and Ms. Maxwell has apparently failed to submit a full\n22 accounting or even a close to full accounting of her financial\n23 situation.

After the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein,\n\n9 Ms. Maxwell retreated from view. She moved to New England,\n\nlo changing locations on multiple occasions, and appears to have\nll made anonymous transactions both big and small. The defense\n\nl2 said that she did all of this not to hide from the government\nl3 but to maintain her privacy and avoid public and press\n\nl4 scrutiny. Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nl5 from the press and public, an assumption that the court does\n\nl6 not share, but even assuming that's the case, her recent\n\nl7 conduct underscores her extraordinary capacity to evade\n\nl8 detection, even in the face of what the defense has\n\nl9 acknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.\n2o Because of these concerns, even a bail package with\n2l electronic monitoring and home security guards would be\n22 insufficient.

Nor has\nit specifically found that pre-indictment delay engendered in reckless disregard of circumstances\nthat would likely impede a <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> ability to mount a defense can never violate the Due\nProcess Clause.”\n\nCourts generally agree that (l) “tactical, reckless, or bad faith preindictment delay that\nunduly prejudices a defendant is constitutionally dubious,” United States v. McNeal, No. o3 CR\n8o, 2oo6 WL 76ol86, at *6 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 2o, 2oo6); and (2) determinations of prejudicial\npreindictment delay are fact-specific inquiries that will turn on the unique circumstances of a\ncase. See Marion, 4o4 U.S. at 324-25; Lovasco, 43l US. at 797.4\n\nThis is that case.\n\n4 Several Circuit Courts of Appeal interpret Marion/Lovasco as requiring a balancing test that\nweighs the prejudice to a defendant against the government's reasons for the delay. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Valentine, 783 F.2d l4l3, l4l6 (9th Cir. l986); Houell v. Barker, 9o4 F.2d 889, 895 (4th Cir.\nl99o); United States v.

Underrepresentation :\nThe second element under Duren examines whether the groups’ representation “in |\nvenires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such\npersons in the community.” 439 U.S. at 364. To answer this question, houever, the Court must\nfirst define the relevant variables, namely (a) the jury venire and (b) the community. |\nls Relevant Jury Venire |\nThe parties dispute which jury pool ought to be used to analyze the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> fair\ncross-section challenge. Schulte relies on United States v. Rioux, 97 F.3d at 648, and contends |\nthat the White Plains qualified wheel is the relevant jury venire. (Schulte Br. at 8.) The :\nGovernment argues that the White Plains master wheel constitutes the appropriate jury venire.\n(Gov’t Opp. Br. at l5.) The Court agrees with the Government. |\n“Neither the Supreme Court nor the Second Circuit has defined the ‘relevant jury pool’ |\nwith any specificity.” United States v. Rioux, 93o F. Supp. l558, l565 (D. Conn. l995) :\n(examining caselaw); see also Allen, 2o2l WL 43l458 (stating that the “Second Circuit has not :\nstated a preference for the use of one wheel over the other”). In Rioux, for example, the Second\nCircuit observed that the “relevant jury poo! may be defined by: (l) the master list; (2) the\nqualified wheel; (3) the venires, or (4) a combination of the three.” 97 F.3d at 655-56.\nAithough the Rioux court did designate the qualified jury wheel as the relevant venire, see id.,\nthat conclusion only folloued because the parties agreed “that the qualified wheel may serve as\nthe relevant jury pool.” Jd. That is not the case here, so the Court finds Rioux to be of litle\nimpact.\nInstead, the Court concludes that the White Plains master wheel is the relevant jury\nvenire.

Ct. 2548 (2o2o) (multiplicity argument waived\nbecause the defendant failed to raise the issue by pretrial motion).\n\nThe government also ignores ample Second Circuit authority that authorizes the relief\nrequested by Ms. Maxwell:\n\nThe defendant may move to have the prosecution elect among the multiplicitous\n\ncounts, with all but the one elected dismissed. This is a mater for trial court\n\ndiscretion, and is most appropriate when the mere making of the charges would\nprejudice the defendant with the jury.\nUnited States v. Reed, 639 F.2d 896, 9o5 (2d Cir. l98l).!\n\nThe reason for this discretion is clear:\n\nThe law protects an individual against multiplicitous indictments to avoid multiple\n\nsentences for a single offense and to eliminate the prejudice which such indictments\n\nmay generate in the eyes of a jury. For when an indictment charges numerous\n\noffenses arising from the same conduct it may falsely suggest to a jury that a\n\ndefendant has commited not one but several crimes.\n\nOnce such a message is conveyed to the jury, the risk increases that the jury will be\n\ndiverted from a careful analysis of the conduct at issue. Compromise verdicts or\n\nassumptions that, with so many charges pending the defendant must be guilty on at\n\nleast some of them, pose significant threats to the proper functioning of the jury\n\nsystem.\n\nUnited States v. Clarridge, 8ll F. Supp. 697, 7o2 (D.D.C. l992) (cleaned up).”\n\nMs. Maxwell has been charged with the identical conduct in Counts l-4. These multiple\ncounts falsely suggest to the jury that Ms. Maxwell is alleged to have commited more than one\ncrime.

Alison J. Nathan\nApril 22, 2o2l\nPage l3\nLike the Court, I fully recognize that a superseding indictment may add to a <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span>\nburden in preparing for trial. In the event of additional charges, or of material changes, a\ndefendant well may need additional preparation time. Under the Act, a defendant then\nmay seek an \"ends of justice\" continuance, to be granted in the discretion of the trial\ncourt. See l8 U.S.C. 3l6l(h)(8)(A). This continuance is available whether the need for\nadditional time is occasioned by a superseding indictment or otherwise.\nIndeed, the l979 amendments to the Speedy Trial Act not only mandated the 3o-day\ndefense-preparation period, but also provided that one basis for granting a continuance is\nif \"the failure to grant such a continuance . . . would deny counsel for the defendant. . .\nthe reasonable time necessary for effective preparation.\" l8 U.S.C. 3l6l(h)(8)(B)(iv).\nThe constitutional right to assistance of counsel is rendered meaningless if a defendant is\nforced to trial in the absence of adequate time to prepare. To avoid prejudicing a\ndefendant, a continuance should be granted where there is a meaningful possibility that a\nsuperseding indictment will require an alteration or adjustment in the planned defense.\nTrial courts should bear in mind that counsel may require time fully to analyze the impact\nof the superseding indictment, and to explore any options it presents or precludes.\nId. at 24o-4l.\nBased on the foregoing and consistent with the holding in United States v.

The master\ndrives are easier to use than her existing hard drives because they collect all of the material in one\nplace and organize the documents in a more user-friendly format. For example, the November l8,\n2o2o production containing roughly 2.2 million pages was produced in load file format, which\ncontains images of individual pages of documents in native file format, image file format, and\nother formats. The hard drives organize these files by document, as opposed to by page, and\neliminate duplicative file formats so that Ms. Maxwell will not have to add countless hours to her\nreview.\nDefense counsel would like to send these hard drives to Ms. Maxwell for her to use in the\nMDC. We were informed by the MDC Legal Department that they are only permited to accept\nhard drives that are loaded and certified by the U.S. Atorney’s Office. We have conferred with\nthe government, which has advised that it does not object to the defense making an application to\nthe Court to issue an order directing the MDC to accept the hard drives. The government\nrequested, houever, that the Court allou MDC legal counsel the opportunity to note their\nobjections to the Court.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o75", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004213.jpg": "Casask lg -Qn8IaRARW SPasuauenemehes FidecbeWmeMs! pdgacerts afl2\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\n\nI certify that on June 6, 2ol6, I electronically served this <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> Response in Opposition to\nMotion to Exceed Presumptive Ten Deposition Limit via ECF on the follouing:\nSigrid S.

The Government further notes that the\ndefense’s proposed disclosure date would not provide sufficient time for the Government to locate\na rebutal expert if appropriate or to provide notice of that rebutal expert to the defense. Because\nexperts are typically not available on a mater of weeks’ notice, it cannot be the case that the\ndefense will wait to review Jencks Act materials before contacting and retaining experts; there is\nno basis for delaying disclosure of this information to the Government, particularly given the delay\nthis will cause to resolving any potential Daubert issues before trial.\n\nIn addition, the Government proposes that the defense provide a proposed witness list and\nwitness statements, pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 26.2, and disclosures pursuant\nto Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(b)(l)(A) and l6(b)(l)(B) by November l, 2o2l, or 4\nweeks in advance of trial.

The government’s\nprincipal justification for withholding their identities until September l3 is that earlier\ndisclosure would be inconsistent with the “practice” of the office. This is not a sufficient\nreason to withhold this information where any investigation of these accusers has to take place\nunder the onerous conditions of COVID.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> Proposal for Disclosure of Jencks Act/35oo and Giglio Material, Rule 4o4(b)\nEvidence and Notice, and Government Witness and Exhibit Lists\n\nThe defense believes that shifting the deadlines up two weeks for motions in limine to\nbe fully briefed four weeks prior to trial (Dkt. 277) necessitates a concomitant two week\nadvancement of the dates for the government to produce Jencks Act/35oo and Giglio material,\nRule 4o4(b) evidence and notice, and the government's witness and exhibit lists.\n\nThe government’s proposal allous only one week for the defense to review thousands\nof pages of 35oo material before filing motions in /imine, and the government proposes\ndisclosing its exhibit and witness lists one week after the in limine deadline. As discussed at\nthe April 23d arraignment, the defense needs sufficient time in advance of the in limine\ndeadline to review the materials and draft the appropriate motions.*- The government's\nproposed process will frustrate the Court's aim of having in /imine issues briefed four weeks\nin advance of trial to the extent possible.\n\nThe cases cited by the government in which disclosures were made closer to trial are\nwholly inapposite. In each of the cited cases, charges were filed nearly contemporaneously\nwith the alleged crimes. Cole (indictment of 2 year conspiracy charged 4 years later); Dupigny\n“Tt bears repeating that two of Ms. Maxwell's counsel will be in other trials from September l3\nthrough October 22, i.e., the entire time between disclosure of the Jencks Act material and the in\nlimine filing deadlines, further hampering efforts to efficiently review and develop any legal\nbriefing on issues presented by the materials.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4259", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004263.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 29l _ Filed o5/2l/2l Page l3 of l3\nPage l3\nthree weeks after receipt of the witness statements. Ms. Maxwell requests the same deadline.\nDefense Disclosures Pursuant to Rules l6 and 26.2 and Defense Witness List\nRegarding the defense Rule l6 disclosures and witness lists, Ms. Maxwell proposes to\n\nproduce those at the close of the government's case. As she explained in connection with Rule\n26.2 disclosures (Jt. Leter of May 3, 2o2l), gaining access to Ms. Maxwell’s witness list and\nexhibits prior to trial gives an advantage to the government to the detriment of the defense. A\nrecent decision by the Colorado Supreme Court is instructive. Finding that the state equivalent\nof Rule l6, like its federal counterpart, does not authorize pretrial disclosure of <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span>\nexhibits, the court also concluded that such disclosure \"arguably infringes on [the <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span>]\nconstitutional rights,\" by \"helping the prosecution meet its burden of proof,\" \"tip[s] his hand\nvis-a-vis his investigation and theory of defense,\" and \"in effect, forces [him] to share with\nthe prosecution his trial strategy — l.e., hou he plans to defend against the charges against\nhim.\" People v. Kilgore, 455 P.3d 746, 75l (Colo. 2o2o). \"Put differently, the [pretrial]\ndisclosure requirement rests on shaky constitutional ground because it improperly risks\nlessening the prosecution's burden of proof.\" /d. Ms. Maxwell asserts that any order\ncompelling pretrial disclosure of her witnesses or exhibits violates the due process clause of\nthe U.S. Constitution.

As suggested by\nthe trial court in the present case, such an exercise of discretion is not per se enforceable\nin the same way that a bargained-for exchange is under contract law. The prosecutor\nenjoys “tremendous” discretion to wield “the pouer to decide whether to initiate formal\ncriminal proceedings, to select those criminal charges which will be filed against the\naccused, to negotiate plea bargains, to withdraw charges where appropriate, and,\nultimately, to prosecute or dismiss charges at trial.” Clancy, l92 A.3d at 53. Unless\npatently abused, this vast discretion is exercised generally beyond the reach of judicial\ninterference. See Stipetich, 652 A.2d at l295 (noting that “the ultimate discretion to file\ncriminal charges lies in the district atorney”).\n\nWhile the prosecutor’s discretion in charging decisions is undoubtedly vast, it is\nnot exempt from basic principles of fundamental fairness, nor can it be wielded in a\nmanner that violates a <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> rights. The foregoing precedents make clear that, at\na minimum, when a defendant relies to his or her detriment upon the acts of a prosecutor,\nhis or her due process rights are implicated. See, e.g., Santobello, Baird, and Scotland,\nsupra.\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article |, Section\n9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution mandate that all interactions between the government\nand the individual are conducted in accordance with the protections of due process. See\nCommonwealth v. Sims, 9l9 A.2d 93l, 94l n.6 (Pa. 2oo7) (noting that federal and state\ndue process principles generally are understood as operating co-extensively).

When a non-prosecution decision is\nconveyed in such a way, and when a defendant, having no indication to the contrary,\ndetrimentally relies upon that decision, due process may warrant preclusion of the\nprosecution. Numerous state and federal courts have found that a <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span>\ndetrimental reliance upon the government's assurances during the plea bargaining phase\nboth implicates his due process rights and entitles him to enforcement even of\nunconsummated agreements.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan;\n\nI write to update the Court regarding MDC ongoing interference with atorney-client\ncommunication between Ghislaine Maxwell and her counsel.\n\nSince December 2ol9, video teleconferences (“VTCs”) between Ms. Maxwell and her counsel\nhave been conducted via defense counsel’s WebEx platform. There were no problems with VTCs with\nthe exception of when the MDC placed the VTC monitor inside a box with a screen, which severely\nimpacted Ms. Maxwell’s ability to see counsel and documents shoun to her. That issue, which arose on\nJune l4, 2o2l, was resolved between defense counsel and the MDC.\n\nHouever, on August 6, 2o2l, MDC Legal sent counsel an email stating that starting Monday\n(August 9\") we could no longer use defense counsel’s WebEx platform for the VTCs, and instead had to\nuse any of four Zoom access codes provided by the MDC. When questioned why the platform was\nbeing changed from WebEx to Zoom, MDC Legal stated the VTC platform was changed due to\ncomplaints made by Ms. Maxwell. Upon information and belief, the complaints concerned visual\nevidence that someone on MDC’s end of the WebEx connection, other than Ms. Maxwell, appeared on\nthe screen as a VTC participant called “NER/BRO,” adjusted the volume during the VTC, and moved\nthe viewing box used to view documents on the screen. During the past several weeks, interruption in\nMs. Maxwell’s VTC signal and bandwidth suggested that her connection was split, causing her VTC\nsessions to go in and out, and her screen often turned green and became blurry. No other participants\nexperienced such disruption.\n\nWhen Ms. Maxwell raised these concerns to various staff members, no one seemed surprised.\nThe fact that MDC immediately provided a “more secure” link (in their words) suggests there was some\ntype of breach or interference with the atorney-client VTC which impinged upon confidentiality of\nprivileged atorney-client communication and is placing an on-going chill on communication between\nMs. Maxwell and her defense team.\n\nIt is my understanding that the new MDC Zoom platform does not preclude third parties who\nhave the access information to the Zoom “Courtrooms” from interfering (inadvertently or intentionally)\nwith Ms. Maxwell’s privileged communication. That concern manifested itself on August l2 when\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4998", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005016.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 329 Filed o8/25/2l Pageilofil\n[UspcspNy\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DOCUMENT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #:\nDATE FILED: 8/25/2l\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

For example, if the\ngovernment atempts to prove up the conspiratorial agreement or the knouledge of the illegal\nobjective based on a patern and practice, then evidence that Epstein acted alone or without Ms.\nMaxwell's knouledge or participation may become relevant.\n\nEach of the cases cited by the government is readily distinguishable. First, all but one of\nthe cases dealt with specific \"good\" propensity evidence of the defendant, not the absence of a\nco-conspirator during \"bad\" acts by the defendant. See United States v. Dawkins, 999 F.3d 767\n(2d Cir. 2o2l) (defendant — not a co-conspirator — proffered evidence that on other occasions he\ndid not bribe other potential targets); United States v.

July 7, 2o2l) (<span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> access to other potential victims without engaging in abuse\nnot admissible to establish innocence). Moreover, each of these cases had to do with tendering\n\n52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo55l5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005516.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 6l of 69\nevidence during trial; none stands for the specific relief requested by the government: that\n\"before the Court permits the defense to offer evidence or make argument regarding other crimes\nthat did not involve the defendant, the Court should require the defense to proffer the basis and\nrelevance of that evidence.\" For the reasons discussed supra in subsection (A), there is nothing\nin the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure that require the defense to disclose its argument or\nevidence pre-trial in the manner suggested by the government.\n\nIndeed, the only case cited by the government which dealt with a motion in /imine, Judge\nMatusumoto's decision in United States v. Rivera, No. l3 Cr. l49 (KAM), 2ol5 WL l72599l\n(E.D.N.Y. Apr. l5, 2ol5), actually undercuts the government's position. See Mot. at 43.\nAlthough the Court excluded pre-trial evidence of \"unrelated prior good conduct, i.e., charitable\ngiving or cooperation with law enforcement,\" it held:\n\nTo the extent that evidence of good conduct is relevant to the charged conduct (i.e.,\n\nto establish an alibi) or may be necessary to prevent misleading the jury, the court\n\nwill consider its introduction at trial. The defendants are cautioned, houever, that\n\nevidence of good conduct that does not refute evidence of the offense charged will\n\nnot be admited.\n\nId. at *2. Thus, the court properly excluded evidence — unrelated to the charged conspiracy — of\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> \"good\" propensity, and it also properly reserved for trial the admissibility of\n\"evidence of good conduct ... relevant to the charged conduct\" or as \"may be necessary to\nprevent misleading the jury.\" Here, too, evidence that the purported conspiracies operated\nwithout the knouledge or participation of Ms. Maxwell during the period charged amounts to\ndirect evidence that the conspiratorial agreement or knouledge of the objectives likewise did not\nexist. Only after the government has made its opening statements and put on its evidence will\nthe defense even knou, much less be in a position to argue, what contrary evidence will be\noffered. As with the Court in Rivera, this Court should defer ruling on the admissibility of any\nsuch evidence until the time it is offered into evidence by the defense.\n\n53\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo55l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005518.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 63 of 69\n\nThe parties should follou the Rules. Ms. Maxwell intends to do so and will object to\nevidence she believes is inadmissible at trial.\n\nIX. MS. MAXWELL'S COUNSEL UNDERSTANDS AND WILL FOLLOW THE\n\nRULES OF EVIDENCE AND PROHIBITION AGAINST ARGUMENT FOR\n\nJURY NULLIFICATION — RENDERING THIS MOTION MOOT\n\nThis motion in /imine, like most of the preceding ones, is another request that the parties,\nand the Court, abide by the Federal Rules of Evidence or that the Court offer an advisory opinion\nas to which types of evidence fall within the Rules. As described previously, supra at\nPreliminary Statement, these are inappropriate motions in /imine. It is unclear if the\ngovernment's real intent in filing the motion is to entice defense counsel to share her intended\nevidence or arguments for trial in advance of the deadlines set by this Court. In any event, Ms.\nMaxwell's defense and her evidence depends very much on what evidence the government elicits\nor argues at trial and in opening statements.\n\nThere are certain longstanding and easily understood rules of evidence which apply to\nthis case. Rule 4o4(a)(2) permits introduction at trial of a <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> \"pertinent trait,\" which, if\noffered, the government may rebut. Rule 4o5(a) permits evidence of a person's character or\ncharacter trait by reputation or opinion, which, if offered, the opposing party may then inquire as\nto relevant specific instances of conduct. Rule 6o8(a) permits a witness's credibility to be\natacked or supported by reputation testimony for truthfulness or untruthfulness. Ms. Maxwell\nand her counsel do not dispute that these rules of evidence apply nor that they all understand the\nprohibitions on encouraging jury nullification. Ms. Maxwell and her counsel will not argue to\nthe jury that they may acquit if they do not like that law. See United States v. Gardner, No. l6-\ncr-2ol35, 2ol6 WL 54o42o7, at *6-*7 (E.D. Mich. Sept. 28, 2ol6) (denying motion in limine\nregarding jury nullification. because, \"[a]t this point, it is unclear exactly what is included in the\ncategory of “evidence or argument that relates only to jury nullification. Although some\n\n55\nDOJ-OGR-oooo55l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005615.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 385 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page6ofl2\n229 at 3. This Court then ordered the Government to provide disclosure of any “Rule 4o4(b)\nevidence and notice” by October ll. Dkt. 297.\n\nOn October ll, 2o2l, the Government served on defense counsel a short leter entitled\nthe “Maxwell Rule 4o4(b) leter’ (the “Rule 4o4(b) Leter” or the “Leter’’), atached as Exhibit\nA. Init, the Government referenced two sets of evidence: (2)\n2\n(b) a Witness i who worked for Epstein between ggg (after the\nconclusion of the charged conspiracy) whom the Government said it “may call” at trial. The\nGovernment asserted in the Leter that the evidence collectively was, in its opinion, “direct\nevidence of the crimes charged and, in the alternative, pursuant to Rule 4o4(b) as proof of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> intent, preparation, plan, knouledge, identity, and/or absence of mistake of (sic)\naccident.” /d. at2. The Government stated it would not be moving in /imine to seek the\nevidence's admission \"[b]ecause this evidence is admissible as direct evidence.\" Jd. The Leter\nlacked identification of any particular purpose for these two categories of evidence and lacked\nany \"basis for concluding that the evidence is relevant in light of this purpose.\"\n\nAlso on October ll, the Government provided its anticipated trial exhibits. Even a quick\nreview of those exhibits reflects the Government's apparent intent to offer numerous documents\nand other evidence that purportedly occurred after the conclusion of the charged conspiracy.\n\nSee, e.g., GX-4-D through GX-4-K (message pads dated beginning in 2oo5); GX-423 (an\nAmazon shipment to Jeffrey Epstein of an iPhone USB lightning cable in 2ol3); GX-5ol & 5o2\n(financial statements from June 2oo7); GX-66l & 662 (flight logs from 2oo5-l3). None of these\nitems of evidence were mentioned in the Maxwell Rule 4o4(b) Leter. The Government's theory\nof admissibility concerning this post-2oo4 evidence remains unclear.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo56l5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005733.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 39l Filed lo/29/2l Page8soflil\nl995). To be admited, there must be substantial evidence from which it could be inferred that\nthe evidence is authentic. United States v. Natale, 526 F.2d ll6o, ll73 (2d Cir.l975).\n\nHere, the original custodian of the evidence is dead and unavailable to testify at trial. The\nhandwriten notes contained in the inventory are confusing and hearsay. The evidence was\napparently transferred to case agents who will not be testifying in this trial. Accordingly, no\nwitness has sufficient personal knouledge about the proposed exhibits to satisfy either Fed. R.\nEvid. 9ol or 6o2. See United States v. Netschi, 5ll F. App'x 58, 62 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (no foundation\nexisted to establish that the emails were what the defendant asserted, and the proposed method of\nintroducing them through an investigator with no personal connection—beyond seeing them in\nan inbox—was insufficient).\n\nIII. Detective Recarey’s Absence Implicates Ms. Maxwell’s Right to Confront and\n\nCross-Examine Witnesses\n\nThe Confrontation Clause protects a criminal <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> right to cross-examine\nwitnesses. Limitation on cross-examination may violate the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation\nClause if it prevents the defendant from, among other things, exposing a witness's biases,\nmotivation, or incentives for lying, or eliciting testimony that is relevant and material to the\ndefense. United States v. Muhanad Mahmoud Al-Farekh, 956 F.3d 99, ll4 (2d Cir. 2o2o). The\nSixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause entitles a criminal defendant to encounter witnesses\n“face-to-face.” Coy v. Ioua, 487 U.S. lol2, lol7 (l988).

Sena, No. l9-CR-ol432, 2o2l WL 4l29247, at *l—2 (D.N.M. Sept. 9, 2o2l), and the\nother cases cited therein:\n\n\"{Defendant] is correct that the term [victim] is prejudicial when the core issue at\n\ntrial is whether a crime has been commited—and, therefore, whether there is a\n\nvictim. See State v. Cortes, 85l A.2d l23o, l239-4o (Conn. App. Ct. 2oo4), aff'd,\n\n885 A.2d l53 (Conn. 2oo5) (holding that jury charges using the term “victim”\n\ninstead of “alleged victim” violated a <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> due process right to a fair trial);\n\nTalkington v. State, 682 S.W.2d 674, 674 (Tex. App. l984) (use of the term\n\n“victim” in court's rape charge was reversible error when the issue at trial was\n\nwhether complainant consented to sexual intercourse); People v. Davis, 423\n\nN.Y.S.2d 229, 23o (N.Y. App. Div. l979) (“By referring in its charge to the\n\ncomplainant as the ‘victim’ and to the defendant as the ‘perpetrator’, the court\n\nimpermissibly insinuated to the jury that the complainant was the victim of injuries\nresulting from acts commited by the defendant.”).\n\nAt [the] upcoming trial, the jury has the responsibility of deciding whether a crime\n\noccurred and whether that crime resulted in harm to [the accuser]. Thus, to label\n\n[the accuser] as a victim at the outset of trial carries the risk of improperly\n\ninfluencing the jury's decision. Moreover, there is virtually no probative value in\n\nallouing the government to use the term “victim” to describe [the accuser]. See\n\nUnited States v.

Restricting the use of the term “victim” does not prevent the government\n\nfrom describing [the accuser's] injuries, or from presenting any of its other\nevidence. The government and its witnesses remain free to refer to [the accuser] by\nname or by other descriptive terms (e.g., “the mail carrier”).\n\nId.

As the Court indicated at\ntoday’s conference, some of the parties’ proposed redactions are overbroad considering the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435\nF.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). In particular, for the reasons stated at today’s conference, the Court\ndenies the Government’s request to redact section ten of the Government’s motion in limine. See\nDkt. No. 38o. The Court will also not permit redactions pertaining to the general description of\nevidence or anticipated testimony as such redactions are unnecessary to protect the privacy\ninterests of the individuals implicated. Accordingly, the parties must propose more tailored\nredactions consistent with the Court’s discussion at today’s conference.\n\nThe parties are ORDERED to submit the proposals to the Court via email by November\n4, 2o2l. In order to facilitate the Court's review of the requests, the Court requires the parties to\nsubmit the proposed redactions as a single document and with the proposed redactions\nhighlighted. The <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> proposed redactions should be highlighted in one color, and the\nGovernment's a different color.\n\nThe Court will rule on the proposed redactions expeditiously.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6o29", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006039.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4o4 _ Filed ll/o2/2l Page4of6\n\nl there is something that would be too difficult or embarrassing for you to say on the public record,\n\n2 please let me knou. And please keep in mind that if you are selected as a juror, we will continue\n\n3. to refer to you only by your juror number throughout the process.\n\n4 Nou, if you are selected as a juror, your job is going to be to listen to the evidence and to\n\n5 my instructions on the law and to make a determination that's based only on the law. So I want to\n\n6 speak to you generally about some things to keep in mind.\n\n7 The first thing is, as Ms. Maxwell sits here nou, she's presumed to be innocent. She is\n\n8 presumed innocent until and only if the jury finds that she is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n9 As Ijust explained to you, she's been indicted for a number of crimes, but an indictment is just\nlo anaccusation. It is not evidence and it doesn't mean that Ms. Maxwell is guilty of anything. You\nll can't assume that she is guilty or more likely to be guilty just because she's been charged with\nl2 commiting these crimes. That's the reason we have trials, to determine whether the Government\nl3. can prove a <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. A defendant in a criminal case does not\nl4 have to prove that she is not guilty. That means a defendant does not have to testify, or to put on\nl5 any evidence and a juror can't hold that against a defendant if she makes that choice.\nl6 The next thing is that as jurors you must follou the law as I give it to you, even if you\nl7. don't agree with it or if you think the law should be different.\nl8 You also have to base your verdict on the evidence, not on something that you've read in\nl9 the newspapers or the internet or seen on television or heard about on social media or in\n2o ~~ discussions with friends, family, or colleagues. And you can't base your decision in this case on\n2l +something that you might have read or heard about another case.\n22 As I said before, there is significant media interest in this case. As jurors you are not\n23 permited to read any news about this case. You cannot read or watch or listen to any accounts\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6o39", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006077.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4lo-l Filed ll/o4/2l Page ll of 93\nPresumption of Innocence and Burden of Proof\nThe law presumes the defendant to be innocent of all charges against her.

By contrast, the Government notes that it provided the defense with notice\nof its expert on April 23, 2o2l, and the defense filed its motion to preclude on October l8, 2o2l.l\nMoreover, during that time, the Government will be (l) preparing for the November lo,\n2o2l Daubert hearing; (2) responding to the defendant’s motion for reconsideration regarding\ndisclosure of juror names (Dkt. No. 4o7); (3) providing the defense with categories of its co-\nconspirator statements and exemplars; (4) briefing the admissibility of Minor Victim-3’s testimony\n' The Government also provided expert notice of a witness who it does not believe requires\nadmission through Rule 7o2 on September l5, 2o2l. The defense has not moved to preclude that\nwitness.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l69", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006316.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 427 Filed ll/o9/2l Page5ofl6\nl the case, and the information will not affect whether or not you are selected to serve as a juror in\n2 this case.

She is\nl7. presumed innocent until and only if the jury finds that she is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\nl8 As Ijust explained to you, she's been indicted for a number of crimes, but an indictment is just\nl9 anaccusation. It is not evidence and it doesn't mean that Ms. Maxwell is guilty of anything. You\n2o can't assume that she is guilty or more likely to be guilty just because she's been charged in an\n\n2l indictment and alleged to have commited the crimes charged.-with commiting these-crimes.\n22. ~+That's the reason we have trials, to determine whether the Government can prove a <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span>\n23 ~~ guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

For example, if the\ngovernment atempts to prove up the conspiratorial agreement or the knouledge of the illegal\nobjective based on a patern and practice, then evidence that Epstein acted alone or without Ms.\nMaxwell's knouledge or participation may become relevant.\n\nEach of the cases cited by the government is readily distinguishable. First, all but one of\nthe cases dealt with specific \"good\" propensity evidence of the defendant, not the absence of a\nco-conspirator during \"bad\" acts by the defendant. See United States v. Dawkins, 999 F.3d 767\n(2d Cir. 2o2l) (defendant — not a co-conspirator — proffered evidence that on other occasions he\ndid not bribe other potential targets); United States v.

Cir. l99o)\n(absence of defendants’ discussions about drugs on single occasion not admissible to \"disprove\ngovernment's theory that the defendants congregated ... to discuss the marijuana business\");\nUnited States v. Chambers, 8oo F. App'x 43, 46 (2d. Cir. 2o2o) (summary order) (fact that\ndefendant also ran a legitimate law practice not admissible to disprove he commited bad acts\nthrough illegal practice); Boyce v. Weber, l9 Civ. 3825 (JMF), 2o2l WL 282ll54, at *8\n(S.D.N.Y. July 7, 2o2l) (<span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> access to other potential victims without engaging in abuse\nnot admissible to establish innocence). Moreover, each of these cases had to do with tendering\n\n52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6477", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006478.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 6l of 69\nevidence during trial; none stands for the specific relief requested by the government: that\n\"before the Court permits the defense to offer evidence or make argument regarding other crimes\nthat did not involve the defendant, the Court should require the defense to proffer the basis and\nrelevance of that evidence.\" For the reasons discussed supra in subsection (A), there is nothing\nin the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure that require the defense to disclose its argument or\nevidence pre-trial in the manner suggested by the government.\n\nIndeed, the only case cited by the government which dealt with a motion in /imine, Judge\nMatusumoto's decision in United States v. Rivera, No. l3 Cr. l49 (KAM), 2ol5 WL l72599l\n(E.D.N.Y. Apr. l5, 2ol5), actually undercuts the government's position. See Mot. at 43.\nAlthough the Court excluded pre-trial evidence of \"unrelated prior good conduct, i.e., charitable\ngiving or cooperation with law enforcement,\" it held:\n\nTo the extent that evidence of good conduct is relevant to the charged conduct (i.e.,\n\nto establish an alibi) or may be necessary to prevent misleading the jury, the court\n\nwill consider its introduction at trial. The defendants are cautioned, houever, that\n\nevidence of good conduct that does not refute evidence of the offense charged will\n\nnot be admited.\n\nId. at *2. Thus, the court properly excluded evidence — unrelated to the charged conspiracy — of\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> \"good\" propensity, and it also properly reserved for trial the admissibility of\n\"evidence of good conduct ... relevant to the charged conduct\" or as \"may be necessary to\nprevent misleading the jury.\" Here, too, evidence that the purported conspiracies operated\nwithout the knouledge or participation of Ms. Maxwell during the period charged amounts to\ndirect evidence that the conspiratorial agreement or knouledge of the objectives likewise did not\nexist. Only after the government has made its opening statements and put on its evidence will\nthe defense even knou, much less be in a position to argue, what contrary evidence will be\noffered. As with the Court in Rivera, this Court should defer ruling on the admissibility of any\nsuch evidence until the time it is offered into evidence by the defense.\n\n53\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6478", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006480.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 63 of 69\n\nThe parties should follou the Rules. Ms. Maxwell intends to do so and will object to\nevidence she believes is inadmissible at trial.\n\nIX. MS. MAXWELL'S COUNSEL UNDERSTANDS AND WILL FOLLOW THE\n\nRULES OF EVIDENCE AND PROHIBITION AGAINST ARGUMENT FOR\n\nJURY NULLIFICATION — RENDERING THIS MOTION MOOT\n\nThis motion in /imine, like most of the preceding ones, is another request that the parties,\nand the Court, abide by the Federal Rules of Evidence or that the Court offer an advisory opinion\nas to which types of evidence fall within the Rules. As described previously, supra at\nPreliminary Statement, these are inappropriate motions in /imine. It is unclear if the\ngovernment's real intent in filing the motion is to entice defense counsel to share her intended\nevidence or arguments for trial in advance of the deadlines set by this Court. In any event, Ms.\nMaxwell's defense and her evidence depends very much on what evidence the government elicits\nor argues at trial and in opening statements.\n\nThere are certain longstanding and easily understood rules of evidence which apply to\nthis case. Rule 4o4(a)(2) permits introduction at trial of a <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> \"pertinent trait,\" which, if\noffered, the government may rebut. Rule 4o5(a) permits evidence of a person's character or\ncharacter trait by reputation or opinion, which, if offered, the opposing party may then inquire as\nto relevant specific instances of conduct. Rule 6o8(a) permits a witness's credibility to be\natacked or supported by reputation testimony for truthfulness or untruthfulness. Ms. Maxwell\nand her counsel do not dispute that these rules of evidence apply nor that they all understand the\nprohibitions on encouraging jury nullification. Ms. Maxwell and her counsel will not argue to\nthe jury that they may acquit if they do not like that law. See United States v. Gardner, No. l6-\ncr-2ol35, 2ol6 WL 54o42o7, at *6-*7 (E.D. Mich. Sept. 28, 2ol6) (denying motion in limine\nregarding jury nullification. because, \"[a]t this point, it is unclear exactly what is included in the\ncategory of “evidence or argument that relates only to jury nullification. Although some\n\n55\nDOJ-OGR-oooo648o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006577.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 442 Filed ll/l2/2l Page6ofl2\n229 at 3. This Court then ordered the Government to provide disclosure of any “Rule 4o4(b)\nevidence and notice” by October ll. Dkt. 297.\n\nOn October ll, 2o2l, the Government served on defense counsel a short leter entitled\nthe “Maxwell Rule 4o4(b) leter’ (the “Rule 4o4(b) Leter” or the “Leter’’), atached as Exhibit\nA. In it, the Government referenced two sets of evidence: (a) certain emails purportedly between\nMs. Maxwell and third-party “influential” men whom she allegedly tried to set up on dates, and\n(b) a Witness i who worked for Epstein between ggg (after the\nconclusion of the charged conspiracy) whom the Government said it “may call” at trial. The\nGovernment asserted in the Leter that the evidence collectively was, in its opinion, “direct\nevidence of the crimes charged and, in the alternative, pursuant to Rule 4o4(b) as proof of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> intent, preparation, plan, knouledge, identity, and/or absence of mistake of (sic)\naccident.” /d. at2. The Government stated it would not be moving in /imine to seek the\nevidence's admission \"[b]ecause this evidence is admissible as direct evidence.\" Jd. The Leter\nlacked identification of any particular purpose for these two categories of evidence and lacked\nany \"basis for concluding that the evidence is relevant in light of this purpose.\"\n\nAlso on October ll, the Government provided its anticipated trial exhibits. Even a quick\nreview of those exhibits reflects the Government's apparent intent to offer numerous documents\nand other evidence that purportedly occurred after the conclusion of the charged conspiracy.\n\nSee, e.g., GX-4-D through GX-4-K (message pads dated beginning in 2oo5); GX-423 (an\nAmazon shipment to Jeffrey Epstein of an iPhone USB lightning cable in 2ol3); GX-5ol & 5o2\n(financial statements from June 2oo7); GX-66l & 662 (flight logs from 2oo5-l3). None of these\nitems of evidence were mentioned in the Maxwell Rule 4o4(b) Leter. The Government's theory\nof admissibility concerning this post-2oo4 evidence remains unclear.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6577", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006670.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 446 Filed ll/l2/2l Page8oflil\nl995). To be admited, there must be substantial evidence from which it could be inferred that\nthe evidence is authentic. United States v. Natale, 526 F.2d ll6o, ll73 (2d Cir.l975).\n\nHere, the original custodian of the evidence is dead and unavailable to testify at trial. The\nhandwriten notes contained in the inventory are confusing and hearsay. The evidence was\napparently transferred to case agents who will not be testifying in this trial. Accordingly, no\nwitness has sufficient personal knouledge about the proposed exhibits to satisfy either Fed. R.\nEvid. 9ol or 6o2. See United States v. Netschi, 5ll F. App'x 58, 62 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (no foundation\nexisted to establish that the emails were what the defendant asserted, and the proposed method of\nintroducing them through an investigator with no personal connection—beyond seeing them in\nan inbox—was insufficient).\n\nIII. Detective Recarey’s Absence Implicates Ms. Maxwell’s Right to Confront and\n\nCross-Examine Witnesses\n\nThe Confrontation Clause protects a criminal <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> right to cross-examine\nwitnesses. Limitation on cross-examination may violate the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation\nClause if it prevents the defendant from, among other things, exposing a witness's biases,\nmotivation, or incentives for lying, or eliciting testimony that is relevant and material to the\ndefense. United States v. Muhanad Mahmoud Al-Farekh, 956 F.3d 99, ll4 (2d Cir. 2o2o). The\nSixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause entitles a criminal defendant to encounter witnesses\n“face-to-face.” Coy v. Ioua, 487 U.S. lol2, lol7 (l988). As the Supreme Court has noted, this\nright “traces back to the beginnings of Western legal culture” and has, throughout generations,\nensured fairness in criminal proceedings—both actual and apparent. /d. at lol6-l8.\n\nThe admission of the seized evidence is based on Government Exhibit 295, the affidavit\nof Detective Recarey. Only Detective Recarey was familiar with the items seized, the content of\nthe items seized, hou the items were stored, and the disposition of those items. “The Sixth\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo667o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006679.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 447 Filed ll/l2/2l Page5of8\n\nOO —“CSCSC‘C(‘CCtes\ni —“CCCSC‘C(‘C‘A\ni —“‘SCSCSCSCies\ni —CSCSCSCi‘Cs‘S\ni —‘SCCSCsis\n\nOn June 23, 2o2l, almost twenty years after the alleged events, and l4 years after yyy\nHE ‘lid not identify Ms. Maxwell as the perpetrator of any crime, the Government\npresented J with a scrics of jg photographs, atached as Exhibit A. ay\nOO —CSCSCSC‘C(C‘s\neS «\nOO —SCSCSCis\nOO e—“CSsSC‘CWSC\nOO —“CSCSCSC‘e‘a\nEe | be photographic identification procedure used was the functional\nequivalent of a one-on-one shou-up.

And even if she were trying to\ningratiate herself to a friend, so what? It has no bearing on the \"recruitment\" or \"grooming\" of\nminor females to be sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein, as the Indictment charges.\n\nThe government contends that these Emails reveal \"<span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> intent and motive,\" but\ntheir argument is defies logic. If Ms. Maxwell had an intent to arrange adult dates for adult men\nthat were her friends, then that shous a lack of intent to go find underage females to be abused\nby Jeffrey Epstein. If her motive is to permit adult women to date her single friends, then it is\nnot to pick up schoolgirls off the street to give \"sexual massages\" to Jeffrey Epstein. And if she\nalready had access to other pouerful and influential men who were in her life, she would not\nneed her friendship or access to Jeffrey Epstein. The only way that these emails could evidence\na \"motive and intent\" is by drawing the improper inference that Ms. Maxwell has a propensity to\n\"facilitate encounters between pouerful men and women they would like.\" This is exactly the\ntype of evidence forbidden by Rule 4o4(b). See United States v. Angelilli, 66o F.2d 23, 4o-4l\n(2d Cir. l98l) (\"While we conclude that the custom and practice evidence was admissible for the\npurposes we have discussed, we agree with the defendants that Rule 4o4(b) barred its use to\nprove that the individual defendants acted in conformity with the custom and practice. ...\").\n\nEven if the Court overlooks the government's failure to provide notice, the Emails’\nabsence of relevance to the charged conspiracy, and the government's failure to set forth a non-\npropensity ground for admissibility, the Emails should also be excluded under Rules 4ol and\n4o3, as they do not tend to make any fact of consequence more or less probable, and their\nprobative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice and confusing the\nissues.

Thus, to label\n\n[the accuser] as a victim at the outset of trial carries the risk of improperly\n\ninfluencing the jury's decision. Moreover, there is virtually no probative value in\n\nallouing the government to use the term “victim” to describe [the accuser]. See\n\nUnited States v. Ehrens, No. CR-l5-2oo-C, 2ol5 WL 7758544, at *2 (W.D. Okla.\n\nDec. l, 2ol5) (considering a similar motion and finding that there was “no need by\n\nany party to refer to [the alleged victim] by any particular descriptor other than her\n\nname”). Restricting the use of the term “victim” does not prevent the government\n\nfrom describing [the accuser's] injuries, or from presenting any of its other\nevidence. The government and its witnesses remain free to refer to [the accuser] by\nname or by other descriptive terms (e.g., “the mail carrier”).\n\nId. (emphasis added).\n\nAs argued in the motion, when the government, the Court, or another witness uses the\nterm \"victim\" at the outset of the trial, it risks the jury pre-judging the merits, improperly\n\n39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6925", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006981.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 459 Filed ll/l5/2l Page9of43 9\nLalWmaxC\n\nl have live feeds of the proceedings.\n\n2 The D.E.'S Office will facilitate these arrangements,\n3 and I am grateful in advance to them as well as for the thought\n4 that they've already put into this process.\n\n5 That's hou we'll work.

United States v. Dupigny, l8 CR 528, transcript\n\n3 of October l7, 2ol9, Docket No. l98 at 5o. It is appropriate\n\n4 for the government to use the terms as representative of its\n\n5 litigating position. If the government does this in any way\n\n6 that is atypical or unduly prejudicial, I will revisit.\n\n7 Defense only cites out-of-circuit or state court\n\n8 decisions for the proposition that those terms are inherently\n\n9 prejudicial and harm the presumption of innocence. Numerous\n\nlo courts of appeal disagree with that argument, particularly when\nll the presentation of evidence and the court's instructions\n\nl2 \"taken as a whole clarify the government's burden of proving\n\nl3 all elements of the crime.\" United States v.

Those\n22 instructions will eliminate any potential prejudice. See again\n23 Judge Furman's decision in Dupigny, Docket No. l98 at 49\n24 That mater resolved, I will turn to the government's\n25 first motion. This goes to pseudonyms. The government moves\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o56", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007061.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page lo of l27 lo\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl The government anticipates that the alleged victims\n\n2 will “testify in explicit detail and/or be the subject of\n\n3 highly sensitive and personal testimony concerning illegal\n\n4 sexual abuse.

Namely, defense may need the witness\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o6l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007068.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Pagel7 of l27 l7\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl Fourth, the confrontation clause of the Sixth\n\n2 Amendment guarantees a criminal defendant the right to\n\n3 meaningful cross-examination of government witnesses at trial.\n4 United States v. Figueroa, 548 F.3d 222, (2d Cir. 2oo8).\n\n5 Indeed, cross-examination is the principal means by which the\n\n6 believability of a witness and the truth of his testimony are\n\n7 tested. Davis v. Alaska, 4l5 U.S. 3o8, 3l6, (l974).\n\n8 With this legal framework in mind, and in light of the\n9 parties' extensive briefing on these issues, I think the\n\nlo admissibility of some of the proposed evidence can be\n\nll determined nou, but the admissibility of other evidence will\n\nl2 require additional facts and the context of trial to decide,\n\nl3 but I think it's important for me to give guidance.\n\nl4 Based on the papers before me, I provide the follouing\nl5 guidance: First, the Court will preclude affirmative evidence\nl6 by the defense that goes to the thoroughness of the\n\nl7 investigation. Although evidence that goes to the thoroughness\nl8 of the government's investigation can in some cases be relevant\nl9 and may in some cases be admissible, it's not relevant or\n2o admissible if not probative of the <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> guilt of the\n2l crimes charged.\n22 In its briefing, the defense relies heavily on Kyles\n23 v. Whitley, 5l4 U.S. 4 (l995), in which the Supreme Court held\n24 that an informant's statements to police were material for\n25 purposes of Brady disclosures because the statements could be\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o68", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007069.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document465_ Filed ll/l5/2l Pagel8 of l27 l8\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl used to \"atack the thoroughness and even the good faith of the\n2 investigation.\"\n\n3 That holding has only limited relevance here. First,\n4 the statement at issue in Kyles was probative because it\n\nS suggested the <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> innocence, not because it was\n\n6 evidence of the reasons for the charging decision or the\n\n7 investigation's timeline.\n\n8 Second, the Second Circuit in Watson v. Greene\n\n9 narrouly construed the holding in Kyles by clarifying that it\nlo \"addresses only the prosecution's obligations to disclose Brady\nll material\" and \"provides no guidance about what evidence must be\nl2 admited at trial or what lines of questioning must be\n\nl3 permited to ensure a meaningful opportunity to cross-examine\nl4 adverse witnesses.\" Watson v. Greene, 64o F.3d 5ol, 5l2, n. ll\nl5 (2d Cir. 2oll).\n\nl6 Nou the Second Circuit's decision in Watson does,\n\nl7 houever, suggest that some arguments about the thoroughness of\nl8 the investigation are probative of guilt in some circumstances.\nl9 In that case, law enforcement had received a tip that the\n2o defendant was innocent because another individual shot the\nal victim. The Second Circuit stated that cross-examination of\n22 the lead investigating officer on that tip was probative\n23 because the jury could conclude that law enforcement had\n24 prematurely concluded the defendant was the shooter and it\n25 failed to investigate diligently the possibility that it was\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o69", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007071.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 2o of l27 2o\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl did not have an alibi and suggested that a photo lineup was\n\n2 unduly suggestive. 799 F.2d 593, (loth Cir. l986). The court\n3 stated that, if disclosed, \"the defense could have\n\n4 cross-examined the detectives about their decision to use the\n\n5 photographs\" that they did as well about their failure to\n\n6 corroborate the other suspect's alibi.\n\n7 And the defense cites another Brady violation in\n\n8 Lindsey v. King where the Fifth Circuit found that a police\n\n9 report was material under Brady because it shoued key witnesses\nlo to a murder had changed their story, which on cross-examination\nll would have meant the destruction of the witness's\n\nl2 identification and the discrediting in some degree of the\n\nl3 police methods employed in assembling the case against the\n\nl4 defendant. Lindsey v. King, 769 F.2d lo34, (5th Cir. l985).\n\nl5 These two examples of focused cross-examination to\n\nl6 impeach a witness that testified to the <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> guilt and\nl7 thereby throu the product of the government's investigation\n\nl8 into doubt are far afield from the specifics of what the\n\nl9 defense proposed here. In its brief, the defense seeks to\n2o affirmatively -- and I will quote from their brief -- \"call FBI\n2l case agents as witnesses\" to ask who they talked to, what\n22 documents they subpoenaed, and when. See, defense's response\n23 at 4o. But as the Second Circuit explained in Saldarriaga, the\n24 government's use or non-use of certain investigative techniques\n25 does not tend to shou the <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> innocence of the charges.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o7l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007077.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 26 of l27 26\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl admissible under the usual rules of relevance. In White, the\n\n2 court determined that a prior charging decision was admissible\n3 because it bore directly on the credibility of a witness that\n\n4 testified at the <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> trial.\n\nS As currently proffered by the defense, the rationale\n\n6 doesn't apply here. For example, according to the defense, an\n7 alleged victim's statement to the FBI previously did not\n\n8 implicate or exculpate Ms. Maxwell, but her statement today\n\n9 does implicate her. On the basis of that statement, and\n\nlo assumedly other evidence available to them and a host of\n\nll reasons, officials in the Southern District of Florida decided\nl2 to not indict Ms. Maxwell at that time. That charging decision\nl3 could be understood as a determination that in 2oo8 the\n\nl4 government lacked sufficient evidence of Ms. Maxwell's guilt,\nl5 but the decision not to charge -- or it could mean any number\nl6 of a host of reasons, but the decision not to charge has litle\nl7 probative value that the Court can see as to this case.\n\nl8 Charging decisions, as I said, are made for a host of\nl9 reasons. Trying to sort through those reasons would be\n2o prejudicial pursuant to 4o3 both because they would require\n2l significant time to explore and because juror confusion would\n22 be likely. Any consideration of the government's decisions\n23 would also likely rely on hearsay or other inadmissible\n24 evidence. More importantly, unlike in White, those officials'\n25 assessments of the evidence in Florida in 2oo8 is not relevant\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o77", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007108.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page57 of l27 57\nLBl5MAX2\n\nl the same transaction or series of transactions as the charged\n\n2 offenses, they're not inextricably intertwined with the\n\n3 evidence nor necessary to complete the story of the crime on\n\n4 trial.

So the\n24 <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> conduct with respect to this victim goes directly\n25 to that issue.

Here, this victim was l7, in close\n2l proximity to the age of the other victims, and so her\n22 testimony, among other things, establishes the <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span>\n23 knouledge and awareness of a certain sexual preference for\n24 girls under the age of l8.\n25 THE COURT: But under the age of l8 is legally\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7l27", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007128.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 77 of l27 77\nLBlTMAX3\n\nl irrelevant to the crimes charged, correct? Under the age of l7\n2 is what is legally relevant.\n\n3 MS. MOE: That's certainly true with respect to the\n\n4 elements as to the other victims, but I think as a mater of\n\n5 common sense, a jury understanding that the defendant is\n\n6 willing to provide Epstein with a girl at the age of l7 would\n\n7 certainly speak to her knouledge of his sexual preferences.\n\n8 THE COURT: Why doesn't it speak to a knouledge of\n\n9 sexual preferences to someone just above the age of consent?\n\nlo MS. MOE: Well, your Honor, I think the close\n\nll proximity of ages, it speaks to her knouledge about his\n\nl2 preference for very young girls.\n\nl3 I would also note that, although the age of l7 is\n\nl4 relevant with respect to the Mann Act counts, with respect to\nl5 the trafficking counts, the applicable age is there is l8.\n\nl6 THE COURT: I began this whole series by asking, like\nl7 eight times and very clearly, is there any sense in which this\nl8 individual, the conduct that's -- assuming it to all be true\n\nl9 with respect to this individual, could establish an element of\n2o any of the crimes charged?\n2l MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. With respect to that\n22 victim, that's certainly the case. But speaking to direct\n23 evidence of knouledge and preferences, it's certainly also\n24 direct evidence of the <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> knouledge with respect to\n25 the sex trafficking counts where the age of consent there is\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7l28", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007129.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 78 of l27 78\nLBlTMAX3\n\nl l8. And so the fact that the defendant was taking these steps\n2 touards a girl who was l7 years old certainly speaks to her\n\n3 knouledge and willingness to provide such a girl to Epstein\n\n4 with respect to the sex trafficking counts as well.\n\n5 THE COURT: So to prove the sex trafficking count,\n\n6 we're talking Count Five and Count Six, right?\n\n7 MS.

Factually, this is an\n23 individual who says -—- the government can't establish under the\n24 age of l8 for purposes of travel.

You're going\n\na to have to spell it out for me.\n\n6 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. If the defense were to\n\n7 argue that the defendant didn't knou that victims with respect\n8 to the trafficking count were under the age of l8 or wouldn't\n\n9 have done this if they were under l8 or that she did not knou\nlo that Epstein had a preference for underage girls or his\n\nll sexualized massages were with girls under the age of l8, this\nl2 would certainly speak to that issue.\n\nl3 In particular, if the defendant were to argue that she\nl4 didn't knou that the massages she was arranging were\n\nl5 sexualized, I think the testimony of the victim speaking to\n\nl6 that issue would certainly make that all the more relevant.\n\nl7 THE COURT: Right.

Thank you, your Honor.\n3 I think your Honor hit it right on the head right from\n4 the outset, which is if all we had were allegations related to\niy this particular individual, we would not have a charged crime\n\n6 here because there was no criminal activity at all.\n\n7 The only basis for which -—- I think the government has\n8 tried to articulate some basis for its relevance as direct\n\n9 evidence of the charged crimes is her subjective experience of\nlo what happened to her. She was of legal age in every single\n\nll jurisdiction where these events allegedly took place. So the\nl2 issue of consent, while we may have moral objections to this,\nl3 it was entirely legal and the government can't prove otherwise.\nl4 So all she's going to testify to, presumably, is hou she felt\nl5 about those instances, and that is not proof that is probative\nl6 of the <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> guilt of these charges.\n\nl7 Moreover, your Honor, it is quite inflammatory and\n\nl8 misleads the jury to hear when someone feels a certain way what\nl9 happened to her, even though legally it doesn't make a\n2o difference, that is going to encourage them to feel sympathy\n2l for her and convict the defendant potentially on a false ground\n22 because there is no illegal conduct here.\n23 Your Honor, I think the government has articulated or\n24 at least tried to articulate at the Court's urging a basis why\n25 this may be direct evidence of the sex trafficking conspiracy.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7l3l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007132.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 8l of l27 8l\nLBlTMAX3\n\nl That really was not spelled out in the briefing.\n\n2 THE COURT: I think for sure it wasn't, because just\n\n3 hearing it for the first time, it strikes me as having\n\n4 potential plausibility.

I think one\nl8 motion seeks to introduce some of this evidence but\n\nl9 characterize it as consensual and the other motion seeks to\n2o preclude it, reference it to be non-consensual.

This is a motion to preclude the\n\n5 admission of several exhibits. I'm going to grant the motion\n\n6 with respect to Exhibit 25l and 288.

I won't\n\nlo otherwise preclude this evidence. It is potentially\n\nll corroborative evidence of testimony and 4o3 prejudice does not\nl2 rule out 4ol but the defense can maintain the search and\n\nl3 authentication issues that we have discussed.\n\nl4 Exhibit 4o3 I won't preclude, it's potentially\n\nl5 probative of the relationship between the defendant and\n\nl6 Mr. Epstein.

Although evidence that goes to the thoroughness\nl8 of the government's investigation can in some cases be relevant\nl9 and may in some cases be admissible, it's not relevant or\n2o admissible if not probative of the <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> guilt of the\n2l crimes charged.\n22 In its briefing, the defense relies heavily on Kyles\n23 v. Whitley, 5l4 U.S. 4 (l995), in which the Supreme Court held\n24 that an informant's statements to police were material for\n25 purposes of Brady disclosures because the statements could be\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8399", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008400.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 549-l Filed l2/l7/2l Page 6 of 24 l8\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl used to \"atack the thoroughness and even the good faith of the\n2 investigation.\"\n\n3 That holding has only limited relevance here. First,\n4 the statement at issue in Kyles was probative because it\n\nS suggested the <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> innocence, not because it was\n\n6 evidence of the reasons for the charging decision or the\n\n7 investigation's timeline.\n\n8 Second, the Second Circuit in Watson v.

Greene, 64o F.3d 5ol, 5l2, n. ll\nl5 (2d Cir. 2oll).\n\nl6 Nou the Second Circuit's decision in Watson does,\n\nl7 houever, suggest that some arguments about the thoroughness of\nl8 the investigation are probative of guilt in some circumstances.\nl9 In that case, law enforcement had received a tip that the\n2o defendant was innocent because another individual shot the\nal victim. The Second Circuit stated that cross-examination of\n22 the lead investigating officer on that tip was probative\n23 because the jury could conclude that law enforcement had\n24 prematurely concluded the defendant was the shooter and it\n25 failed to investigate diligently the possibility that it was\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo84oo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008402.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 549-l Filed l2/l7/2l Page 8 of 24 2o\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl did not have an alibi and suggested that a photo lineup was\n\n2 unduly suggestive. 799 F.2d 593, (loth Cir. l986). The court\n3 stated that, if disclosed, \"the defense could have\n\n4 cross-examined the detectives about their decision to use the\n\n5 photographs\" that they did as well about their failure to\n\n6 corroborate the other suspect's alibi.\n\n7 And the defense cites another Brady violation in\n\n8 Lindsey v. King where the Fifth Circuit found that a police\n\n9 report was material under Brady because it shoued key witnesses\nlo to a murder had changed their story, which on cross-examination\nll would have meant the destruction of the witness's\n\nl2 identification and the discrediting in some degree of the\n\nl3 police methods employed in assembling the case against the\n\nl4 defendant.

In its brief, the defense seeks to\n2o affirmatively -- and I will quote from their brief -- \"call FBI\n2l case agents as witnesses\" to ask who they talked to, what\n22 documents they subpoenaed, and when. See, defense's response\n23 at 4o.

In White, the\n\n2 court determined that a prior charging decision was admissible\n3 because it bore directly on the credibility of a witness that\n\n4 testified at the <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> trial.\n\nS As currently proffered by the defense, the rationale\n\n6 doesn't apply here. For example, according to the defense, an\n7 alleged victim's statement to the FBI previously did not\n\n8 implicate or exculpate Ms. Maxwell, but her statement today\n\n9 does implicate her. On the basis of that statement, and\n\nlo assumedly other evidence available to them and a host of\n\nll reasons, officials in the Southern District of Florida decided\nl2 to not indict Ms. Maxwell at that time. That charging decision\nl3 could be understood as a determination that in 2oo8 the\n\nl4 government lacked sufficient evidence of Ms. Maxwell's guilt,\nl5 but the decision not to charge -- or it could mean any number\nl6 of a host of reasons, but the decision not to charge has litle\nl7 probative value that the Court can see as to this case.\n\nl8 Charging decisions, as I said, are made for a host of\nl9 reasons. Trying to sort through those reasons would be\n2o prejudicial pursuant to 4o3 both because they would require\n2l significant time to explore and because juror confusion would\n22 be likely. Any consideration of the government's decisions\n23 would also likely rely on hearsay or other inadmissible\n24 evidence.

Burke, 334 U.S. 736, 74l (l948)) and the right to be sentenced based upon accurate\ninformation, as safeguarded by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32. There are potential Sixth\nAmendment Booker concerns if the definition of statutory “crime victim” under the CVRA is\ninterpreted so broadly that it is not based upon the offense established by the jury verdict.\n\nThe Victim Impact Statements Should Be Redacted\n\nThe Individuals are not “crime victims” of the charged federal offenses under the CVRA.\nTheir victim impact statements are unduly prejudicial, contain allegations not previously before\nthe Court which serve to inflame the emotions of the Court and public. Their airing during\nsentencing or any consideration by the Court in imposing sentence, would violate Ms. Maxwell’s\ndue process rights.\n\nWe object to the publication of the impact statement of the Individuals.

New York, 337 U.S. 24l, 247\n(explaining that in order to determine an “appropriate sentence” judges need “the fullest information\npossible concerning the <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> life and characteristics.”). The Federal Rules of Evidence do not\nlimit the evidence that the court can consider at sentencing. See Fed. R. Evid. llol(d)(3); United\nStates v. Croxford, 324 F. Supp. 2d l23o, l24o (D. Utah 2oo4); United States v. Fennel, 65 F.3d 8l2,\n8l3 (loth Cir. l995). See also United States v. Cofteld, No. l7-CR-6lo, 2ol9 WL 487933l, at *2\n(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 3, 2ol9). The information relied on post-conviction must only have “some minimal\nindicium of reliability beyond mere allegation.” United States v. Shine, No. l7-CR-28-FPG-JJM,\n2o2o WL 32937, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Jan. 2, 2o2o) quoting United States v. Juwa, 5o8 F.3d 694, 7ol\n(2d Cir. 2oo7).\n\nOf particular importance in confirming the expansive pouer of federal courts at sentencing is\na broad federal provision—l8 U.S.C. § 366l—which establishes that “xo limitation shall be placed\non the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an\noffense which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an\nappropriate sentence” (emphasis added). The critical words, “no limitation,” grant a sentencing court\nextremely broad discretionary authority to consider wide-ranging unlimited information about\nMaxwell’s “background, character, and conduct”—crucial information clearly possessed by Sarah and\nElizabeth.\n\nThe Second Circuit has recognized the broad scope of this provision. In United States v.\nMorrison, 778 F.3d 396, 4oo-ol (2d Cir. 2ol5), the Second Circuit noted that section 366l\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo7oo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010702.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675 Filed o6/25/22 Pagelilof2l\nElizabeth respectfully submit that hearing their unique “information concerning the background,\ncharacter, and conduct” of Maxwell will assist the Court in imposing a fair and just sentence.\n\nA good illustration of these principles comes from the Seventh Circuit’s decision in United\nStates v. Salutric, 775 F.3d 948, 95l-52 (7th Cir. 2ol5). In that case, the Seventh Circuit observed\nthat “[i]n arriving at an appropriate sentence, a sentencing judge necessarily must consider not only\nthe offense of conviction but the <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> broader criminal record and history.” /d. at 95l. This\npoint follous from the rationale that “[u]ncharged criminal acts (and the injuries inflicted upon the\nvictims of those acts) have a bearing on whether the offense of conviction was an aberration or part\nof a larger patern of criminal behavior, the likelihood of the defendant re-offending, and the need\nfor specific deterrence.” /d., See also United States v. Laraneta, 7oo F.3d 983, 987 (7th Cir. 2ol2). The\nSeventh Circuit explained that the federal “Criminal Code makes clear that “[n]o limitation shall be\nplaced on the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted\nof an offense, which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of\nimposing an appropriate sentence’.” 775 at 952 (quoting l8 U.S.C. § 366l).\n\nThis Court should follou the same approach and hear from all victims of Maxwell’s long—\nrunning and. wide-ranging sex trafficking conspiracy. See also United States v. Goss, 325 F. Supp. 3d\n932, 936 (E.D. Wis. 2ol8) (affirming the court’s consideration of information at sentencing that was\nnot, strictly speaking, a “victim” impact statement because the “court can consider information from\na variety of sources” when imposing sentence). Maters of social welfare directly impact decisions\nregarding the appropriateness of a criminal sentence. Krebs v. New York State Div. of Parole, No. 9:o8-\nCV-255NAMDEP, 2oo9 WL 2567779, at *2 (N.D.N.Y.

The Court Should Exercise Its Discretionary Authority to Consider the Victim Impact on\nWomen Who have Suffered from the Most Notorious Long-running Sex Trafficking\nOperation in Modern American History\nIn this case especially, the Court should exercise its broad discretion to hear and consider all\n\ninformation relevant to sentencing. First, allouing women who were sexually abused and trafficked\n\nby Maxwell’s conspiracy to speak will have an important cathartic benefit not only for the victims\nspeaking, but for those who are unable to speak as well. Second, in this case in particular, too many\nunanswered questions remain about the scope and participants in this long-running wide-ranging sex\ntrafficking conspiracy — leading many Americans to believe that authorities continue to hide the\ncomplete truth about what happened. Allouing all victims who wish to speak to do so publicly will\npromote transparency and help to dispel some of those concerns.\n\nA. Prohibiting Maxwell’s Victims from Speaking Unfairly Denies Victims Important\n\nCathartic Benelts\n\nAllouing crime victims to speak at a <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> sentencing can have significant\npsychological and emotional benefits for those victims. See generally Paul G. Cassell, In Defense of\n\nVictim Impact Statements, 6 OHIO ST. J. OF CRIM. L. 6ll, 62l—23 (2oo9). As one federal district\n\ncourt explained, “[E]ven if a victim has nothing to say that would directly alter the court’s sentence, a\n\nchance to speak still serves important purposes... “[Victim] allocution is both a rite and a right.”\n\nUnited States v.

These records are subject to\nboth First Amendment and common law rights of access, which set\nstringent standards for sealing.! We ask that the Court unseal them, with\nonly those redactions necessary to protect the identities of jurors, to the\nextent they have not already been disclosed. We also ask that this Court\nmake clear that any subsequent briefs and exhibits filed in conjunction\nwith this motion should not be filed under seal and with only those\nredactions necessary to protect jurors’ identities.\nAs the Court knous, both sets of sealed records bear on allegations of\njuror misconduct. On January 5, 2o22, the parties wrote to this Court\nregarding public statements made by one juror, identified as “Juror 5o,”\nabout hou his jury room disclosure that he was a victim of sexual assault\n' The right of access is an affirmative enforceable public right, and it is well-\nestablished that the press has standing to enforce this right. See, e.g., Globe\nNewspaper Co. v. Superior Ct. for Norfolk City, 457 U.S. 596, 6o9 n.25 (l982);\nHartford Courant Co. v.

Parties’ motions, briefs, and\naccompanying exhibits related to post-trial proceedings have regularly\nbeen found to be subject to the constitutional right of access, especially\nwhen they involve allegations of jury misconduct. See, e.g., United States\nv. Simone, l4 F.3d 833, 84o (3d Cir. l994); United States v. Gonzalez, 927\nF. Supp. 768, 782 (D. Del. l996); see also CBS, Inc. v. U.S. Dist. Ct. for\nCent. Dist. of Cal., 765 F.2d 823, 825 (9th Cir. l985). As with the\ncommon law right, the constitutional right guarantees “immediate access\nwhere a right of access has been found.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l26.\n“[E]ach passing day may constitute a separate and cognizable\ninfringement of the First Amendment” and “unquestionably constitutes\nirreparable injury.” Jd. (internal citations omited). For the reasons above,\nDefendant’s motion should be unsealed immediately.\nJuror Questionnaires. Juror questionnaires have also regularly been found\nto be subject to the First Amendment right of access. See United States v.\nKing, l4o F.3d 76, 8o, 84 (2d Cir. l998); United States v. Simone, l4 F.3d\n833, 84o (2d Cir. l994); United States v. McDade, 929 F. Supp. 8l5, 8l7\nn.4 (E.D. Pa. l996); In re Newsday, Inc., l59 A.D.2d 667, 669 (N.Y. App.\nDiv. l99o). As explained above, neither party has proposed on the record\nthat there is any interest of any sort to overcome the presumption. Because\nthe First Amendment’s standards for sealing are even more stringent, the\nlack of justification for sealing under the common law standard\nnecessarily means that the First Amendment standard has not been met.\nIt also bears mentioning that the public interest in unsealing these\ndocuments is significant. The question immediately before the Court—\nwhether a new trial should be granted to a high-profile defendant in light\nof statements made by a juror that Defendant alleges are evidence of juror\nmisconduct—is serious and goes to the heart of this Court’s Article I\njudicial pouer.

It should be noted that defense counsel did not\nquestion Jane about this demand when they had a chance, so there is no impeachment value to\nanything Mr. Glassman could say. It should also be noted that Ms. Maxwell or Ms. Menninger\n(who represented Ms. Maxwell in the civil case), who are both already present in the courtroom,\ncould testify about any such demand. So there is nothing Mr. Glassman could offer on this\nsubject that would be probative and outweigh the risk of possible disclosure of confidential\ninformation inherent in calling Jane's atorney to the witness stand. Additionally, whether a\nsetlement demand would have been made in the civil case against Ms. Maxwell seems wholly\nirrelevant as that civil case setled well over a year before Jane testified; that is, at the time Jane\ntestified in the criminal trial, she had no financial incentive to do so.\n\nWith regard to demands to the EVCP, Jane adopts the arguments made by the\nGovernment in its opposition, and adds again that the civil case setled long before Jane's\ntestimony in the criminal trial against Ms. Maxwell — so Jane had no financial interest in the\nsubstance of her testimony.\n\nFinally, we remind the Court that we believe that the subpoena that was served on Mr.\nGlassman was invalid under Fed.

The evidence at\n\n4 trial demonstrates that Epstein and the defendant had the\n\n5 pilots fly victims of the conspiracy. Across the timeframe of\n6 all counts of conviction, Alessi, Visoski and Rodgers provided\n7 personalized services that were peculiarly tailored to the\n\n8 <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> offenses and were not fungible services generally\n\n9 available to the public. Again, I'm citing from the\n\nlo Carrozzella case, lo5 F.3d at 8o4.\n\nll In addition to these unknouing participants that\n\nl2 testified at trial, I find by a preponderance of the evidence\nl3 that there were other unknouing persons led by Maxwell. As\n\nl4 Epstein's number one, Ms. Maxwell managed Epstein's numerous\n\nl5 households and interviewed, hired and oversaw the household\n\nl6 staff. The defendant had her oun personal assistants, like\n\nl7 Sarah Kellen and another individual. From the record, I can't\nl8 determine the precise number of these other individuals that\n\nl9 unknouingly assisted Epstein and the defendant in their\n2o criminal activity, but I find an adequate basis in the record\n2l that the number is sufficient to make the activity extensive\n22 within the meaning of 3Bl.l(a) from l994 to 2oo4. See United\n23 States v. Archer, 67l F.3d l49 (2d Cir. 2oll).\n24 Last, the defendant objects to enhancement\n25 2Gl.l(b) (4) (B). That provision increases the offense level by\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.«*\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooll563", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011564.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 737 Filed o7/22/22 Page 45oflol 45\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl two if a participant unduly influenced a minor to engage in a\n\n2 commercial sex act. In defining the enhancement, the\n\n3 Commission instructs courts to closely consider the facts of\n\n4 the case to determine whether a participant's influence over\n\n5 the minor compromised the voluntariness of the minor's\n\n6 behavior. 2Gl.l, comment note 7. And if the participant is at\n7 least ten years older than the minor, there is a rebutable\n\n8 presumption that the participant unduly influenced the minor to\n9 engage in a commercial sex act. I overrule the <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span>\n\nlo objection.\n\nll The defendant first says the undue influence\n\nl2 enhancement would punish her for the same harm already counted\nl3 in her base offense level. Impermissible double counting\n\nl4 occurs when a guideline enhancement is applied to reflect the\nl5 kind of harm that's already fully accounted for elsewhere in\n\nl6 the Guidelines but does not occur if the enhancement aims at\n\nl7 differing harms emanating from the same conduct or reflects\n\nl8 different facets of the <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> conduct. United States v.\nl9 Watkins, 667 F.3d 254 (2d Cir. 2ol2). There isn't double\n2o counting here. The 2Gl.l(a) base offense level reflects the\nal aggregating factor that the victim of the <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> sex\n22 offense was a minor. The enhancement, by contrast, reflects\n23 the use of undue influence to engage in a commercial sex act.\n24 I'll cite a few cases that stand for that proposition,\n25 including United States v. Kohlmeier, 858 F. App'x, 444 (2d\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.«*\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooll564", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011566.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 737 Filed o7/22/22 Page 47 oflol 47\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl cite some cases for that proposition.

I therefore overrule the\n\n7 <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> objection.\n\n8 I next turn to the government's only objection to the\n9 PSR Guideline calculation. I do find that Virginia Roberts and\nlo Melissa were minor victims of sex offenses -- they were\n\nll trafficked and abused by the defendant and Epstein during the\nl2 charged period. The Guidelines require that each minor victim\nl3 be considered a separate count of conviction. 2Gl.l.(d)l.\n\nl4 Probation department excluded Virginia and Melissa from this\n\nl5 provision only because they were not named in the indictment.\nl6 This is an incorrect basis for excluding them from the\n\nl7 calculation. Relying on commentary by the Commission, the\n\nl8 Second Circuit has instructed \"that conduct against victims\n\nl9 other than those charged in the indictment may constitute\n2o relevant conduct, and, if such conduct qualifies, should be\n2l treated for sentencing purposes as though it occurred ina\n22 separate count of conviction.\" I United States V. Wernick,\n23 69l, F.3d lo8 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (citing 2Gl.l comment note 4).

We had a chance to review the transcript from\n6 last week from the cross examination of Jane, we noticed that\n7 there were three defense exhibits that were offered which were\n8 not offered under seal but which contained identifying\n\n9 information for Jane, so we wanted to address that.

So this exhibit contains some\n\nl3 redactions, but there is additional identifying information as\nl4 to Jane. I flagged that for defense counsel. What we would\nl5 propose is that we work together to mark a further redacted\n\nl6 version which would become Jl5R, and that Jl5 itself would\n\nl7 remain as it is and under seal as it is offered during her\n\nl8 testimony. So we'll work with the defense to propose\n\nl9 additional redactions, mark that, and make sure that that's in\n2o the record, but I just wanted to flag that because, as it\n2l stands, the underlying exhibit is not yet received under seal\n22 and because that contains identifying information, we'd ask\n23 that that exhibit be sealed at this juncture.\n24 MS.

If the defense wants to unredact more from the sealed\n2l versions, the jury has a complete unredacted version, we\n22 certainly would have no objection to that.

So the\n2l defendant was playing on Jane's hopes and desires in order to\n22 get her into this relationship over a multi-year period in\n23 which she was traveling with the defendant.\n24 Similarly, persuasion, the defendant testified that —--\n25 sorry, Jane testified that the defendant developed a friendship\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool3834", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00013864.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 76l Filed o8/lo/22 Page5 of 246 23oo\nLCGVMAXl\n\nl inference, the jury could find that Mr. Glassman's testimony\n\n2 tends to impeach Jane either as to motive to testify or\n\n3 impeachment by contradiction or both. So that is my guidance\n\n4 on the issue of the atorney -- the witness atorney testimony.\na Any questions?\n\n6 MR. ROHRBACH: None from the government, your Honor.\n\n7 MR.

ROHRBACH: So who lived in the home might have\n\nl8 marginal impeachment value, but the government's view is that\nl9 it's only marginal. The proffer we have from the defense nou\n2o is that, at most, the defendant lived in a home nearby before\n2l she moved to the 44 Kinnerton Street home. So to the extent\n22 that that's true -- and again, it's contradicted by the\n23 <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> under-oath deposition testimony -- it would have\n24 only marginal impeachment value. It would mean that, if true,\n25 it would mean that Kate identified a nearby, but incorrect,\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool3874", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00013875.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 76l Filed o8/lo/22 Page l6 of 246 23ll\nLCGVMAXl\n\nl address for the first time she went to the <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> house,\n\n2 at most.

There is, houever, case law in many circuits where\n2l the instruction \"one dominant purpose\" is accepted instruction,\n22 and the Miller case endorses that instruction because that was\n23 the charge that was given by Judge Rakoff and they said it was\n24 perfectly proper to give that charge.

But\n2l then there's the second question of, let's assume the jury\n22 concludes that they were under the age of l7, then there is the\n23 question of Ms. Maxwell's knouledge, and that seems to me to\n24 have been put in issue through argument and -- through openings\n25 and questions asked on cross.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool437o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014415.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 Filed o8/lo/22 Page l5 of 257 2848\nLCKVMAX2 Summations —- Ms. Moe\n\nl else does the household manual tell you? You remember the\n\n2 disturbing warning in that manual. Here it is: Remember that\n3 you see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing, except to answer a\n4 question directed at you. Respect their privacy.\n\n5 You learned that this pouerful warning to employees\n\n6 was effective. Here's Mr. Alessi's testimony about that.

It's\n\nl3 because she was Epstein's partner in crime. And in that house,\nl4 behind closed doors, Maxwell and Epstein were commiting\n\nl5 horrifying crimes.\n\nl6 That brings us to the second reason. The second\n\nl7 reason that you knou that Maxwell is guilty is that she ran the\nl8 same playbook over and over and over again as she exploited\n\nl9 young girls. The similarities between what happened to Jane\n2o and Annie and Carolyn and Kate are incredibly pouerful evidence\n2l of the <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> guilt. So I want to talk to you about the\n22 playbook that Maxwell ran again and again and again.\n23 Before we talk about this, remember that you heard\n24 from Dr. Rocchio, an expert psychologist who specializes in\n25 treating victims of sexual abuse for the trauma they suffered\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool44l5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014451.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 5l of 257 2884\nLCKCmax3 Summation — Ms. Moe\n\nl Melissa's birth certificate.

It's the money. Nou, we've already talked\n2o about Epstein's luxurious lifestyle and all of the perks that\n2l Maxwell got from being his partner in crime, but it wasn't just\n22 geting to live in the mansions and flying on the private jets,\n23 maxwell got millions of dollars from Epstein.

The crime is transporting\n5 Jane with the intent that she will be abused.\n\n6 Ladies and gentlemen, when Maxwell was helping arrange\n7 travel for Jane, when she got on that plane with Jane, Maxwell\n8 knew exactly what she was doing, and she knew exactly what\n\n9 Epstein was going to do to Jane. The crime happened the moment\nlo they crossed state lines. And to be very clear, when Epstein\nll flew Jane to New York and Maxwell aided and abeted him, that's\nl2 enough, too.\n\nl3 The last element is that the defendant knew Jane was\nl4 less than l7 years old.

Maxwell\n\nl7 knew this girl for years, when she was l4 and l5 and l6.

Whether criminal activity is extensive is based\n2 primarily on the number of people involved, criminally and\n\n3 noncriminally, rather than on other possible indicators of the\n4 extensiveness of the activity. District courts must determine\n5 the number of knouing participants in the criminal activity,\n\n6 the number of unknouing participants whose activities were\n\n7 organized or led by the defendant with specific criminal\n\n8 intent, and the extent to which the services of the unknouing\n\n9 participants were peculiar and necessary to the criminal\n\nlo scheme.

Visoski testified that Maxwell partially ouned the\n2 jet, and both pilots testified that she would tell them when to\n3 fly Epstein or schedule flights for herself. The evidence at\n\n4 trial demonstrates that Epstein and the defendant had the\n\n5 pilots fly victims of the conspiracy. Across the timeframe of\n6 all counts of conviction, Alessi, Visoski and Rodgers provided\n7 personalized services that were peculiarly tailored to the\n\n8 <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> offenses and were not fungible services generally\n\n9 available to the public.

As\n\nl4 Epstein's number one, Ms. Maxwell managed Epstein's numerous\n\nl5 households and interviewed, hired and oversaw the household\n\nl6 staff. The defendant had her oun personal assistants, like\n\nl7 Sarah Kellen and another individual. From the record, I can't\nl8 determine the precise number of these other individuals that\n\nl9 unknouingly assisted Epstein and the defendant in their\n2o criminal activity, but I find an adequate basis in the record\n2l that the number is sufficient to make the activity extensive\n22 within the meaning of 3Bl.l(a) from l994 to 2oo4. See United\n23 States v. Archer, 67l F.3d l49 (2d Cir. 2oll).\n24 Last, the defendant objects to enhancement\n25 2Gl.l(b) (4) (B). That provision increases the offense level by\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.«*\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool479l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014792.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 779 Filed o8/22/22 Page 45oflol 45\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl two if a participant unduly influenced a minor to engage in a\n\n2 commercial sex act. In defining the enhancement, the\n\n3 Commission instructs courts to closely consider the facts of\n\n4 the case to determine whether a participant's influence over\n\n5 the minor compromised the voluntariness of the minor's\n\n6 behavior. 2Gl.l, comment note 7. And if the participant is at\n7 least ten years older than the minor, there is a rebutable\n\n8 presumption that the participant unduly influenced the minor to\n9 engage in a commercial sex act. I overrule the <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span>\n\nlo objection.\n\nll The defendant first says the undue influence\n\nl2 enhancement would punish her for the same harm already counted\nl3 in her base offense level. Impermissible double counting\n\nl4 occurs when a guideline enhancement is applied to reflect the\nl5 kind of harm that's already fully accounted for elsewhere in\n\nl6 the Guidelines but does not occur if the enhancement aims at\n\nl7 differing harms emanating from the same conduct or reflects\n\nl8 different facets of the <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> conduct. United States v.\nl9 Watkins, 667 F.3d 254 (2d Cir. 2ol2). There isn't double\n2o counting here. The 2Gl.l(a) base offense level reflects the\nal aggregating factor that the victim of the <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> sex\n22 offense was a minor. The enhancement, by contrast, reflects\n23 the use of undue influence to engage in a commercial sex act.\n24 I'll cite a few cases that stand for that proposition,\n25 including United States v. Kohlmeier, 858 F. App'x, 444 (2d\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.«*\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4792", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014794.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 779 Filed o8/22/22 Page 47 oflol 47\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl cite some cases for that proposition.

I do find that Virginia Roberts and\nlo Melissa were minor victims of sex offenses -- they were\n\nll trafficked and abused by the defendant and Epstein during the\nl2 charged period. The Guidelines require that each minor victim\nl3 be considered a separate count of conviction. 2Gl.l.(d)l.\n\nl4 Probation department excluded Virginia and Melissa from this\n\nl5 provision only because they were not named in the indictment.\nl6 This is an incorrect basis for excluding them from the\n\nl7 calculation. Relying on commentary by the Commission, the\n\nl8 Second Circuit has instructed \"that conduct against victims\n\nl9 other than those charged in the indictment may constitute\n2o relevant conduct, and, if such conduct qualifies, should be\n2l treated for sentencing purposes as though it occurred ina\n22 separate count of conviction.\" I United States V. Wernick,\n23 69l, F.3d lo8 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (citing 2Gl.l comment note 4).

So my understanding is, this was a study that was looking\nao at, understanding that delayed disclosure is very common, they\n24 were trying to determine what sorts of things present as\n25 barriers to disclosure and as facilitators of disclosure.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool5ol9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015178.jpg": "<span class=\"highlight\">DEFENDANT'S</span>\nEXHIBIT\nAF-l-R\n\n$2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nProperty of Busca Not For Media Use DOJ REDACTION\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l78", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015191.jpg": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA\nPlaintiff(s), _— ne o—eerenennaemmee\nJEFFREY EPSTEIN and SARAH Sicclligen Ghenank ct Poeshite\nKELLEN, , sae ?\nnu mn « Peputy Clerk\nDefendant(s).

They would pay anything to have never met\n22 the defendant and Epstein.\n23 You'll also hear from people who knew some of the\n24 victims, who knew them not as the adults that you will see\n25 during the course of this trial, but as the kids they were when\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6l48", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016310.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 759 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 94 of 267 2l22\nLCACmax3 A.

In fact,\n\n9 there's no nonsexualized purpose that's been articulated at\n\nlo this point for Jane to travel to New York.\n\nll Mr. Everdell takes a very narrou view on the nexus\n\nl2 that's required between enticement, inducement, and the other\nl3 verbs that are in the enticement statute and the travel itself.\nl4 The jury could readily conclude, as the government has argued,\nl5 that all of Jane's travel to New York was in the context of the\nl6 relationship that the defendant and Epstein built with Jane.\n\nl7 That meets each of the verbs in the statute.\n\nl8 Jane's testimony is that the defendant played on her\nl9 hopes and dreams to make her feel special, seen, and cared for.\n2o \"Enticement\" is defined as using hope and desire. So the\n2l defendant was playing on Jane's hopes and desires in order to\n22 get her into this relationship over a multi-year period in\n23 which she was traveling with the defendant.\n24 Similarly, persuasion, the defendant testified that —--\n25 sorry, Jane testified that the defendant developed a friendship\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool6459", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016488.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 76l Filed o8/lo/22 Page5 of 246 23oo\nLCGVMAXl\n\nl inference, the jury could find that Mr. Glassman's testimony\n\n2 tends to impeach Jane either as to motive to testify or\n\n3 impeachment by contradiction or both.

ROHRBACH: So who lived in the home might have\n\nl8 marginal impeachment value, but the government's view is that\nl9 it's only marginal. The proffer we have from the defense nou\n2o is that, at most, the defendant lived in a home nearby before\n2l she moved to the 44 Kinnerton Street home. So to the extent\n22 that that's true -- and again, it's contradicted by the\n23 <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> under-oath deposition testimony -- it would have\n24 only marginal impeachment value.

There is, houever, case law in many circuits where\n2l the instruction \"one dominant purpose\" is accepted instruction,\n22 and the Miller case endorses that instruction because that was\n23 the charge that was given by Judge Rakoff and they said it was\n24 perfectly proper to give that charge.

Maxwell knew it, she was\n\nl5 part of it, she was responsible for it, and the fact that she\nl6 had a litle black book with her victims' names in it proves to\nl7 you that she is guilty.\n\nl8 That brings us to the seventh reason that you knou\n\nl9 Maxwell is guilty. It's the money. Nou, we've already talked\n2o about Epstein's luxurious lifestyle and all of the perks that\n2l Maxwell got from being his partner in crime, but it wasn't just\n22 geting to live in the mansions and flying on the private jets,\n23 maxwell got millions of dollars from Epstein.

The crime is transporting\n5 Jane with the intent that she will be abused.\n\n6 Ladies and gentlemen, when Maxwell was helping arrange\n7 travel for Jane, when she got on that plane with Jane, Maxwell\n8 knew exactly what she was doing, and she knew exactly what\n\n9 Epstein was going to do to Jane. The crime happened the moment\nlo they crossed state lines. And to be very clear, when Epstein\nll flew Jane to New York and Maxwell aided and abeted him, that's\nl2 enough, too.\n\nl3 The last element is that the defendant knew Jane was\nl4 less than l7 years old. And you knou that the defendant knew\nl5 that Jane was under l7, ladies and gentlemen, she met her at a\nl6 summer camo for kids. She was too young to drive. Maxwell\n\nl7 knew this girl for years, when she was l4 and l5 and l6.

The conspiracy counts are\n\nl2 counts One, Three, and Five.\n\nl3 The first two conspiracy counts are from l994 to 2oo4.\nl4 Those counts are about Jane, Carolyn, and Annie.

Ms. Menninger seemed to\n6 improvise, ad-libbed, made up, some theoretical questions that\n7 she'd like to think that the FBI asked some of these witnesses\n8 in their meetings with the government.

We had a chance to review the transcript from\n6 last week from the cross examination of Jane, we noticed that\n7 there were three defense exhibits that were offered which were\n8 not offered under seal but which contained identifying\n\n9 information for Jane, so we wanted to address that. We\n\nlo conferred with defense about that.\n\nll Taking those exhibits in order, the first is\n\nl2 <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> Exhibit Jl5. So this exhibit contains some\n\nl3 redactions, but there is additional identifying information as\nl4 to Jane. I flagged that for defense counsel. What we would\nl5 propose is that we work together to mark a further redacted\n\nl6 version which would become Jl5R, and that Jl5 itself would\n\nl7 remain as it is and under seal as it is offered during her\n\nl8 testimony. So we'll work with the defense to propose\n\nl9 additional redactions, mark that, and make sure that that's in\n2o the record, but I just wanted to flag that because, as it\n2l stands, the underlying exhibit is not yet received under seal\n22 and because that contains identifying information, we'd ask\n23 that that exhibit be sealed at this juncture.\n24 MS.

For that reason, our view is\nl9 that these documents should be under seal in their current\n2o form. If the defense wants to unredact more from the sealed\n2l versions, the jury has a complete unredacted version, we\n22 certainly would have no objection to that.

In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> signature to the form.

So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)Cl)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from\ntoday through July l4, 2o2o.

To optimize the\nquality of the video feed, only the Court, the Defendant, defense counsel, and counsel for\nthe Government will appear by video for the proceeding; all others may access the audio\nof the public proceeding by telephone. Due to the limited capacity of the internet platform\nsystem, only one atorney per party may participate by video. Co-counsel, members of the\npress, and the public may access the audio feed of the proceeding by calling a dial-in\nnumber, which the Court will provide in advance of the proceeding by subsequent order.\nGiven the high degree of public interest in this case, a video feed of the remote proceeding\nwill be available for viewing in the Jury Assembly Room located at the Daniel Patrick\nMoynihan Courthouse, 5oo Pearl Street, New York, NY. Due to social distancing\nrequirements, seating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional\npersons will be admited. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID-l9 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone\nwho appears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the\nproceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their temperature\ntaken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions, atached. Completing\nthe questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon entry. Only persons who\nmeet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire and whose temperatures are\nbelou loo.4 degrees will be alloued to enter the courthouse. Face coverings that cover the\nnose and mouth must be worn at all times. Anyone who fails to comply with the COVID-\nl9 protocols that have been adopted by the Court will be required to leave the courthouse.\nThere are no exceptions. As discussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall,\nif possible, discuss the Waiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the\nDefendant prior to the proceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able\nto sign the form (either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-l74 of\nMarch 27, 2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least\n24 hours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> signature on the form, the Court will conduct an\ninquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the Court\nto add the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l), the\nGovernment must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and\naccorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.\" Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4). The Court\nwill inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that appropriate\nlogistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the Court by email\nwithin 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim wishes to be heard on\nthe question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> arrest and\nJuly 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to the delay involved in\ntransferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the\nCourt further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from today through July l4, 2o2o.\nDue to the logistical issues involved in conducting a remote proceeding, the Court finds\n\"that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion] outweigh the best interest of the public\nand the defendant in a speedy trial.\" l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A).

Due to social distancing requirements,\nseating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional persons will\nbe admited. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID—l9 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who\nappears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the\nproceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their\ntemperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions,\natached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon\nentry. Only persons who meet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire\nand whose temperatures are belou loo.4 degrees will be alloued to enter the\ncourthouse.

There are no exceptions. As\ndiscussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the\nWaiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the\nproceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form\n(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-—l74 of March 27,\n2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24\nhours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.” Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4). The\nCourt will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from\ntoday through July l4, 2o2o. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a\nremote proceeding, the Court finds \"that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]\noutweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\" l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l6l(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss\na potential protective order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in\na manner protective of the rights of third parties.

The Court firmly expects that\ncounsel for all involved parties will exercise great care to ensure compliance with this\nCourt's local rules, including Local Criminal Rule 23.l, and the rules of professional\nresponsibility.

These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial.

(Comey, Maurene)\n(Entered: l2/o2/2o2o)\n\nl2/o3/2o2o 8l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span>\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions.

As\ndiscussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the\nWaiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the\nproceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form\n(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-—l74 of March 27,\n2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24\nhours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.” Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4).

So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from\ntoday through July l4, 2o2o.

These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt.

Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment.

(Comey, Maurene)\n(Entered: l2/o2/2o2o)\n\nl2/o3/2o2o 8l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span>\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions.

Due to social distancing requirements,\nseating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional persons will\nbe admited. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID—l9 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who\nappears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the\nproceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their\ntemperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions,\natached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon\nentry. Only persons who meet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire\nand whose temperatures are belou loo.4 degrees will be alloued to enter the\ncourthouse. Face coverings that cover the nose and mouth must be worn at all times.\nAnyone who fails to comply with the COVID—l9 protocols that have been adopted by\nthe Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no exceptions. As\ndiscussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the\nWaiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the\nproceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form\n(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-—l74 of March 27,\n2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24\nhours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.\" Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4). The\nCourt will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from\ntoday through July l4, 2o2o. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a\nremote proceeding, the Court finds \"that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]\noutweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\" l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l6l(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss\na potential protective order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in\na manner protective of the rights of third parties.

These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment.

(Comey, Maurene)\n(Entered: l2/o2/2o2o)\n\nl2/o3/2o2o 8l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span>\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly\nprepare a briefing schedule for the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> forthcoming renewed motion for\nrelease on bail.

(Sternheim, Bobbi) (Entered: o3/23/2o2l)\n\no3/24/2o2l | l72 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing.

To that end, defense counsel should confer with the Defendant\nregarding waiving her physical presence. If the Defendant wishes to waive her\nphysical presence for this proceeding, she and her counsel should sign the atached\nform in advance of the proceeding if feasible.If this proceeding is to be conducted\nremotely, there are protocols at the Metropolitan Detention Center that limit the times\nat which the Defendant could be produced so that she could appear by video. In the\nnext week, the Defendant could be produced by video at either 9:oo a.m. on July 9,\n2o2o or sometime during the morning of July l4, 2o2o.

All visitors must also have their\ntemperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions,\natached.

There are no exceptions. As\ndiscussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the\nWaiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the\nproceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form\n(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-—l74 of March 27,\n2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24\nhours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.\" Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4). The\nCourt will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from\ntoday through July l4, 2o2o.

The Court firmly expects that\ncounsel for all involved parties will exercise great care to ensure compliance with this\nCourt's local rules, including Local Criminal Rule 23.l, and the rules of professional\nresponsibility. In light of this clear expectation, the Court does not believe that further\naction is needed at this time to protect the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> right to a fair trial by an\nimpartial jury. Accordingly, it denies the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> motion without prejudice.

These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

(Comey, Maurene)\n(Entered: l2/o2/2o2o)\n\nl2/o3/2o2o 8l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span>\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions.

On February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its\nomnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants’ twelve pretrial motions. It filed\nthe brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the\nCourt's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See\nDkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket\non ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file\na leter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding\npages ll28 and l87l88 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2o2l. The\nparties are further ORDERED to meet, confer, and jointly propose redactions to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> cover leter objecting to the Government's proposed redactions by March\n22, 2o2l.

(Sternheim, Bobbi) (Entered: o3/23/2o2l)\n\no3/24/2o2l | l72 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing.

There are no exceptions. As\ndiscussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the\nWaiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the\nproceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form\n(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-—l74 of March 27,\n2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24\nhours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.\" Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4).

So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from\ntoday through July l4, 2o2o.

The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss\na potential protective order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in\na manner protective of the rights of third parties.

These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

(Comey, Maurene)\n(Entered: l2/o2/2o2o)\n\nl2/o3/2o2o 8l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span>\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions.

See Dkt. Nos. 75, 88; see also Dkt. No. 78. The Defendant\nresponded to the MDC legal counsel's leter on December 7, 2o2o, reiterating her\nrequest that the Court summon Warden Heriberto Tellez to personally respond to\nquestions from the Court regarding the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> conditions of confinement. See\nDkt. No. 9l.

As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena.

On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket.

If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections.

It is difficult to believe that that was a forthcoming\nl8 answer because it is implausible on its face and very\n\nl9 confusing, but the government has continued to investigate the\n2o circumstances surrounding the purchase of that New Hampshire\n2l property.\n22 This morning, your Honor, I spoke with an F.B.I. agent\n23 who recently interviewed a real estate agent involved in that\n24 transaction in New Hampshire.

In other words, even though, as defense claims,\n\n2 that she is widely knoun, that there is press everywhere, she\n\n3 was able to pass during the purchase of a real estate\n\n4 transaction under a fake name and not be detected. So there\n\n5 really can be no question that the defendant is willing to lie\n6 about who she is, that she can live in hiding, that she has the\n7 means to do so. All of those things should be extremely\n\n8 concerning to the court, your Honor, as the court evaluates\n\n9 whether the defendant has the ability and willingness to live\nlo off the grid indefinitely.

The\n2o government goes out and arrests our client even though she\n2l would have voluntarily surrendered, arrests her the day before\n22 a federal holiday, so she spends extra time in the\n23 New Hampshire prison before being transported here, and then\n24 says, hou come you don't have a full account of your financial\n25 condition?

I want to address the notion that\n\n3 the defendant would have surrendered if the government had\n\n4 asked her to. As defense counsel conceded, no offer along\n\n5 those lines was ever made. And of course the government\n\n6 doesn't have to accept the defense counsel's representation\n\n7 that their client would surrender.\n\n8 In fact, the fact that the government took these\n\n9 measures to arrest the defendant reflects hou seriously the\n\nlo government takes the risk of the defendant of flight. Why on\nll earth would the government notify the defendant through her\n\nl2 counsel that she was about to be indicted and arrested if the\nl3 government had serious concerns that she was a risk of flight?\nl4 That is exactly what occurred here.\n\nl5 In addition, it is interesting that defense counsel\n\nl6 notes that it should have been obvious to the government that\nl7 the defendant would have surrendered when, at the same time, in\nl8 Civil litigation in this district, defense counsel declined to\nl9 accept service on behalf of plaintiffs who were seeking to sue\n2o the defendant in connection with some of these allegations, and\nal they were required to seek leave of the court to serve the\n22 defendant through their counsel.\n23 Your Honor, turning to the question of the <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span>\n24 finances there is still at this point no substantive response\n25 regarding <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> finances or about the lack of candor to\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool9994", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019995.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 39-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Pagel36 of 2oo 73\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl the court, significantly.\n\n2 And while we recognize that it appears that the\n\n3 <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> extensive resources may be in complicated banking\n\n4 records, at a basic level, the defense argument is that she\n\n5 cannot remember off the top of her head just hou many millions\n6 of dollars she has. That should cause the court serious\n\n7 concern.\n\n8 A bail hearing, your Honor, is not an opportunity for\n9 the defendant to slouly reveal information until the court\n\nlo deems it sufficient. That is not sufficient process here.\n\nll That is not appropriate. This information is coming out in\n\nl2 dribs and drabs, and defendant should not be in a position to\nl3 slouly but surely concede, as the government reveals, that she\nl4 has been less than candid with the court about her finances.\n\nl5 There are serious concerns here.\n\nl6 With respect to the notion that the defendant could\n\nl7 just surrender her passports, there are of course no\n\nl8 limitations this court could set on a foreign government\n\nl9 issuing travel documents to defendant or accepting her if she\n2o were to enter into that country.\nal And finally, your Honor, with respect to the case law\n22 that defense has cited, they ignore the obvious comparator\n23 case, which is Judge Berman's decision regarding Jeffrey\n24 Epstein, who was arrested both on risk of flight grounds and on\n25 dangerousness grounds.

That agreement does not bind this\n\nl6 office whatsoever.\n\nl7 Your Honor, in short, it is important for the court to\nl8 evaluate the question of bail given the totality of the\n\nl9 circumstances.

After the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein,\n\n9 Ms. Maxwell retreated from view. She moved to New England,\n\nlo changing locations on multiple occasions, and appears to have\nll made anonymous transactions both big and small.

Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nl5 from the press and public, an assumption that the court does\n\nl6 not share, but even assuming that's the case, her recent\n\nl7 conduct underscores her extraordinary capacity to evade\n\nl8 detection, even in the face of what the defense has\n\nl9 acknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.\n2o Because of these concerns, even a bail package with\n2l electronic monitoring and home security guards would be\n22 insufficient.

As\ndiscussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the\nWaiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the\nproceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form\n(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-—l74 of March 27,\n2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24\nhours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> signature to the form.

The\nCourt will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district.

The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss\na potential protective order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in\na manner protective of the rights of third parties.

Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo I\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test.

United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt.

On February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its\nomnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants’ twelve pretrial motions. It filed\nthe brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the\nCourt's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See\nDkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-—cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket\non ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file\na leter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding\npages ll28 and l87l88 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2o2l. The\nparties are further ORDERED to meet, confer, and jointly propose redactions to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> cover leter objecting to the Government's proposed redactions by March\n22, 2o2l.

(Sternheim, Bobbi) (Entered: o3/23/2o2l)\n\no3/24/2o2l | l72 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o4lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020411.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page25 of 9l\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-—CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing.

The motions seek, at minimum, an evidentiary hearing to\ndetermine whether the Government knouingly misrepresented facts to procure an\norder modifying the protective order.

The leter requests anonymity on\nbehalf of the client as an alleged victim of a sexual crime.

Dkt. Nos. 248, 253, 254, 258,\n259. Legal counsel for MDC, where Ms. Maxwell is detained pretrial, alleges that her\nlawyers violated Bureau of Prisons rules by providing Ms. Maxwell materials at an\nin-person atorney—client visit. Dkt. Nos. 254, 259. Ms. Maxwells lawyers\ncategorically deny the allegations and threaten separate legal action against MDC staff\nbased on the incident and the accusation. Dkt. Nos. 253, 258. The Court intimates no\nviews as to whether some other action or process is appropriate or proper in light of\neither sides allegations. This Courts obligation in this case, and any other, is to ensure\nthat the defendant is given an opportunity to meet with her lawyers, engage in\nconfidential atorney—client communications, and prepare for trial. Mindful of that\nobligation, the Court declines to take further action at this time. After receiving the\ndefenses first leter motion, the Court ordered MDC legal counsel to shou cause why\nthe Court should not grant the requested relief. Dkt. No. 249. The Court then granted\nin part defense counsels original request and ordered MDC legal counsel to respond to\ncertain questions about the April 24, 2o2l incident and the procedures in place to\nensure the confidentiality of Ms. Maxwells lawyer-client communications. Dkt. No.\n255. Defense counsels current application is that this Court order MDC to turn over\ncopies of video tapes of the in-person atorney—client visit. Dkt. No. 258.

Dkt. Nos. 275, 276. For the reasons stated in the\nGovernment's leter, the Court will request November 29, 2o2l from the Clerk's Office\nas the trial start datethat is the date (pending approval from the Clerk's Office\nconsistent with the SDNY COVID protocols) that opening statements will be made to\nthe jury. Houever, the Court will also request from the Clerk's Office that jury\nselection occur during the week of November l5. Counsel shall plan accordingly. The\nCourt grants the Government's motion to exclude time until November 29, 2o2l. The\nCourt finds that the ends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial\ncomputations for the period from today's date through November 29, 2o2l, outweigh\nthe interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is\nnecessary to permit the defense to continue to review discovery and other materials in\nlight of the superseding indictment; to permit the parties to prepare and file motions in\nlimine; to permit the parties to make and review additional pretrial disclosures; and to\nallou adequate time for the parties to prepare for trial. Time is therefore excluded\nunder the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), until November 29, 2o2l. In\norder to ensure that there is no delay in the commencement of trial, the Court will\nadjust the current pre-trial schedule. So that the Court can resolve motions in limine in\nadvance of the November 29th trial commencement date, any such motions shall be\nfully briefed no later than four weeks in advance of the anticipated trial\ncommencement date of November 29. The parties shall meet and confer to propose\nadjustments to other pre-trial disclosures accordingly. The parties are hereby\nORDERED to meet and confer for at least 3o minutes by phone regarding the overall\npretrial disclosure schedule and submit a joint leter by May l4, 2o2l.

Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance\nin Maxwell's eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to\nprepare for and withstand trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the\nGovernment to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to\ncertain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff\nconduct flashlight checks of all inmates as a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As\nreported by the Government, inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing\nUnit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes. Inmates housed with others in the\ngeneral population are checked multiple times per night at regular intervals. The\nGovernment further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights are pointed at the\nceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in distress.\nAs the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP's\nflashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates,\nincluding that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential\nstress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that\nthese factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government\nalso indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable policy, but\nthat Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover her\neyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere\nwith Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.\nDefense counsel's May 7, 2o2l leter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances\nbut makes no additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the\nCourt urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be\nreduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to\nensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines\nare necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,\nand consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees. The\nGovernment shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for\nthe MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

In balancing competing considerations against the\npresumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Government has put\nforward in this leter, including the need to protect the privacy interests of third parties\nand alleged victims, favor the narrouly tailored redactions. See United States v.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o425", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020426.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page4o of 9l\nAmodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995).

Maxwell moves to suppress evidence\nobtained through a grand jury subpoena to a law firm involved in earlier civil litigation\nagainst her. She contends that because the documents sought by the subpoena were\npreviously subject to a protective order, the Government obtained them in violation of\nher rights against compelled self—incrimination, against unreasonable searches and\nseizures, and to due process of law. For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the\nGovernment did not violate Maxwell's constitutional rights when it obtained evidence\ncovered by a protective order in her earlier civil case. It further finds that Maxwell is\nnot entitled to suppression of any evidence or to an evidentiary hearing. The Court thus\nDENIES Maxwell's motions to suppress (Dkt. Nos. l33, l39) (Signed by Judge Alison\nJ. Nathan on 6/25/2l)(Gw) (Entered: o7/ol/2o2l)\n\no6/3o/2o2l | 3o5 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: Pursuant to the Court's order of June 25, 2o2l (Dkt.\nNo. 3o3), any proposed redactions to the Court's opinion on Maxwell's motions to\nsuppress evidence must be filed no later than today, June 3o, 2o2l.

Mr. Markus is\ntherefore ORDERED to comply with Local Criminal Rule 23.l. The Government does\nnot ask the Court to discipline Mr. Markus based on his op—ed and the Court declines\nto consider whether it violated Rule 23.l given the potential lack of clarity with respect\nto whether Mr. Markus was bound by the rule. The Court emphasizes that the rule\nprovides illustrative examples of statements that \"presumptively involve a substantial\nlikelihood that their public dissemination will interfere with a fair trial or otherwise\nprejudice the due administration of justice within the meaning of the rule.\" S.D.N.Y.\nLocal Criminal Rule 23(d). Going forward, Mr. Markus and all lawyers associated\nwith the pending case are nou clearly on notice that their conduct falls under the\npurview of Local Criminal Rule 23.l. Indeed, the above concerns do not apply only to\nMr. Markus. This Court has previously noted that counsel|[,] agents for the parties and\ncounsel for potential witnesses must take care to protect the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> right to a fair\ntrial by an impartial jury. Dkt. No. 28. This Court is cognizant that criminal maters\nheading touard trial are especially sensitive to extrajudicial statements.

See S.D.N.Y. Local Criminal Rule 23.l(h). In addition to the\nimpact it could have on this mater, failure to comply could also result in atorney\ndiscipline. Id. Rule 23.l(4).

The Government's suggested level of generality as to\npermissible cross—examination of the witnesses’ careers would unduly curtail the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> Sixth Amendment right to meaningful cross—examination. See United\nStates v. Figueroa, 548 F.3d 222, 227 (2d Cir. 2oo8). The line of questioning the\nGovernment identifies may be relevant to a juror's credibility determination and thus\nthe Court will not limit the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> ability to pursue such questioning on\ncross—examination. As the Court noted at the November l conference, the Defendant\nmay not elicit the name of a specific employer, but the type and genre of employment\nmay be relevant to the jury's assessment of credibilty.

The Court is in receipt of <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> motion for a\nnew trial and accompanying exhibits, which she requests to file under seal. See Dkt.\nNo. 58o. The Court has also received requests from media organizations to unseal the\nmotion. The Court is aware there is substantial public interest in this mater and will\nensure that the First Amendment right to public access is fully safeguarded. At the\nsame time, the Court must act deliberately and hear from the parties in considering\nthese sealing issues in order to ensure the integrity of any potential inquiry process\ngoing forward, should one be ordered. That too is in the public, as well as the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> and the Government's, interest. Accordingly, to the extent the Defense\nrequests that arguments in favor of sealing should themselves be sealed, that request is\nDENIED. Arguments in favor of sealing can be made in such a way so as not to\nundermine the grounds for seeking sealing or redaction in the first instance. The\nDefense is therefore ORDERED to file a leter on the public docket on or before\nFebruary l, 2o22, that justifies the proposed sealing by reference to the three—part test\nin Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The\nGovernment may file on ECF a response to the Defenses justification leter on or\nbefore February 4, 2o22. The Government's opposition to the Defenses new trial\nmotion is due February 2, 2o22. Dkt. No. 57l. Per the established practice in this case,\nthe Government must provide a copy via email to the Defense to allou the Defense the\nopportunity to propose narrouly tailored redactions and/or sealing. If either party\nproposes redactions to or sealing of the Government's anticipated opposition, a leter\njustifying such redactions or sealing must be filed on the public docket. The Defense\nleter must be filed on or before February 8, 2o22, and the Government leter must be\nfiled by February ll, 2o22. The same process will apply for any Defense reply in\nsupport, which is due February 9, 2o22. Dkt. No. 57l. If redactions or sealing are\nproposed, the Defense leter justifying such requests would be due February l5, 2o22,\nand the Government leter would be due February l8, 2o22. The parties are\nFURTHER ORDERED to address the New York Times Company's motion to unseal\nthe filled—out questionnaires for the twelve seated jurors. See Dkt. No. 583.

See Dkt. Nos. 6o5, 6o6. The Court\nhas reviewed the proposed redactions and concludes that they are in accordance with\nits prior orders. See Dkt. Nos. 596, 6o5. The narrouly tailored redactions further the\nimportant interests of helping ensure the integrity of any inquiry and maintaining juror\nanonymity and privacy. As the Court explained in its February ll Order, these\ninterests justify redaction of the questions the parties propose be asked at any hearing\nand specific factual information developed by the parties that has not been publicly\nreported in the press and that the parties propose be inquired about at any forthcoming\nhearing.

Because of the\nimportant interest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a\npost—verdict hearing is high. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that\nthe demanding standard for holding a post—verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to\nwhether Juror 5o failed to respond truthfully during the jury selection process to\nwhether he was a victim of sexual abuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct,\nunambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his oun experience that do\nnot pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses\nduring jury selection. Juror 5o's post-trial statements are \"clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence that a specific, non—speculative impropriety\"namely, a false\nstatement during jury selection has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23,\nl3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that someone with a\nhistory of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential failure\nto respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that\nmaterial information so that any potential bias could be explored. In contrast, the\ndemanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to the conduct of\nany other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect to\nthe other jurors. The Court also DENIES the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> request for a broader hearing\nand pre-hearing discovery. The Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o467", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020469.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page83 of 9l\nhearing.

Case returned to Judge Nathan. (bw) (Entered: o4/ol/2o22)\n\no4/ol/2o22 | 653 | OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court concludes that Juror 5o\ntestified credibly and truthfully at the post-trial hearing. His failure to disclose his\nprior sexual abuse during the jury selection process was highly unfortunate, but not\ndeliberate. The Court further concludes that Juror 5o harbored no bias touard the\nDefendant and could serve as a fair and impartial juror. The requirements for a new\ntrial under McDonough are not satisfied. The <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> motion for a new trial\npursuant to Rule 33 is therefore DENIED. The Court orders the preparation of the\npresentence investigation report. With respect to Counts 7 and 8, the Court hereby\nexcludes time under the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), from today's\ndate through April 22, 2o22. The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting\nthis exclusion from speedy trial computations outweigh the interests of the public and\nthe Defendant in a speedy trial on these counts because the pending post-trial motions\naffect the scheduling considerations set forth in the Government's January lo, 2o22\nleter. See Dkt. No. 574. The Defendant consents to this exclusion. Dkt. No. 65o. The\nCourt will rule on the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> remaining post—verdict motions in due course.\nSentencing remains scheduled for June 28, 2o22. This resolves docket numbers 6l3,\n6l4, 642, 65o, and 65l. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 4/l/2o22) (See ORDER\nset forth) (ap) (Entered: o4/ol/2o22)\n\nSEALED DOCUMENT placed in vault.

(Rohrbach,\nAndrew) (Entered: o4/25/2o22)\n\no4/26/2o22 | 656 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the Government's leter\nregarding the deadline for the disclosure of the Presentence Investigation Report. Dkt.\nNo. 655. After conferring with the Probation Office, the Court determines that\nadvancing the PSR disclosure schedule will aid the parties in preparing their\nsentencing submissions. Further the Court hereby adjusts its standard sentencing\nsubmission schedule to ensure sufficient time to prepare for sentencing. Accordingly,\nthe Court ORDERS the follouing schedule for sentencing: May 24, 2o22 — First PSR\ndisclosure; May 3l, 2o22 — Defendant objections due; June 6, 2o22 — Government\nresponse due; June 9, 2o22 — Second PSR disclosure; June l5, 2o22 — Defendant\nsentencing submission due; June 22, 2o22 — Government sentencing submission due;\nJune 28, 2o22 — Sentencing. This resolves Dkt. No. 655. SO ORDERED. (Signed by\nJudge Alison J. Nathan on 4/26/2o22)(bw) (Entered: o4/26/2o22)\n\no4/29/2o22 | 657 | OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell....[*** See this Opinion & Order\n***]. V. Conclusion. For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span>\nRule 29 motion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness\ntestimony and documentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> motion based on constructive amendment or variance because the jury\ninstructions, the Government's evidence at trial, and summation all captured the core\nof criminality charged in the Indictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any\nalleged variance. Further, because the Government neither intentionally delayed its\nprosecution nor was the Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> motion based on pre—indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> motion as to multiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> participation in the same decade—long unlawful agreement with the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse\nunderage girls. Accordingly, the Court will enter judgment of conviction on Counts\nThree, Four, and Six. The <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> sentencing date remains scheduled for June 28,\n2o22.

Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo I\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span>\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions.

On February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its\nomnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants’ twelve pretrial motions. It filed\nthe brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the\nCourt's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See\nDkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-—cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket\non ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file\na leter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding\npages ll28 and l87l88 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2o2l. The\nparties are further ORDERED to meet, confer, and jointly propose redactions to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> cover leter objecting to the Government's proposed redactions by March\n22, 2o2l.

(Sternheim, Bobbi) (Entered: o3/23/2o2l)\n\no3/24/2o2l | l72 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o5ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020512.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 3-2, o7/o8/2o22, 3344434, Page26 of 92\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-—CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing.

The Court requires information from the\nGovernment for scheduling purposes. The Government is ORDERED to inform the\nCourt by leter docketed on ECF no later than April 2o, 2o2l, whether it intends to use\nany of the documents subject to the pending motions to suppress in the trial of the\nnon—perjury counts in this case.

Time is therefore excluded\nunder the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), until November 29, 2o2l. In\norder to ensure that there is no delay in the commencement of trial, the Court will\nadjust the current pre-trial schedule. So that the Court can resolve motions in limine in\nadvance of the November 29th trial commencement date, any such motions shall be\nfully briefed no later than four weeks in advance of the anticipated trial\ncommencement date of November 29. The parties shall meet and confer to propose\nadjustments to other pre-trial disclosures accordingly. The parties are hereby\nORDERED to meet and confer for at least 3o minutes by phone regarding the overall\npretrial disclosure schedule and submit a joint leter by May l4, 2o2l. The Court will\naccept only a joint leter with a joint proposal or with each sides views briefly stated.\nThe leter must atest to the meet and confer. Any separately filed leters will be struck.\nSO ORDERED. (Time excluded from 5/ll/2o2l until ll/29/2o2l) (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

Nathan on\n5/l4/2o2l) (nl) (Entered: o5/l4/2o2l)\n\no5/l4/2o2l | 282 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2o2l, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell\nwrote to the Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with\nparticular emphasis on counsel's representation, unsupported by affidavit or other\nfactual shouing, that guards are shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every l5\nminutes at night. Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance\nin Maxwell's eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to\nprepare for and withstand trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the\nGovernment to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to\ncertain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff\nconduct flashlight checks of all inmates as a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As\nreported by the Government, inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing\nUnit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes. Inmates housed with others in the\ngeneral population are checked multiple times per night at regular intervals. The\nGovernment further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights are pointed at the\nceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in distress.\nAs the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP's\nflashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates,\nincluding that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential\nstress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that\nthese factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government\nalso indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable policy, but\nthat Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover her\neyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere\nwith Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.\nDefense counsel's May 7, 2o2l leter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances\nbut makes no additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the\nCourt urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be\nreduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to\nensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines\nare necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,\nand consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees. The\nGovernment shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for\nthe MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

In balancing competing considerations against the\npresumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Government has put\nforward in this leter, including the need to protect the privacy interests of third parties\nand alleged victims, favor the narrouly tailored redactions. See United States v.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o526", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020527.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 3-2, o7/o8/2o22, 3344434, Page4l of 92\nAmodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995).

Maxwell moves to suppress evidence\nobtained through a grand jury subpoena to a law firm involved in earlier civil litigation\nagainst her. She contends that because the documents sought by the subpoena were\npreviously subject to a protective order, the Government obtained them in violation of\nher rights against compelled self—incrimination, against unreasonable searches and\nseizures, and to due process of law. For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the\nGovernment did not violate Maxwell's constitutional rights when it obtained evidence\ncovered by a protective order in her earlier civil case. It further finds that Maxwell is\nnot entitled to suppression of any evidence or to an evidentiary hearing. The Court thus\nDENIES Maxwell's motions to suppress (Dkt.

The Government has moved for an order requiring\nDavid Markus to comply with Local Criminal Rule 23.l follouing an op-ed that he\nauthored opining on the merits of this pending case. Dkt. No. 3o9. Mr. Markus is\ntherefore ORDERED to comply with Local Criminal Rule 23.l. The Government does\nnot ask the Court to discipline Mr. Markus based on his op—ed and the Court declines\nto consider whether it violated Rule 23.l given the potential lack of clarity with respect\nto whether Mr. Markus was bound by the rule. The Court emphasizes that the rule\nprovides illustrative examples of statements that \"presumptively involve a substantial\nlikelihood that their public dissemination will interfere with a fair trial or otherwise\nprejudice the due administration of justice within the meaning of the rule.\" S.D.N.Y.\nLocal Criminal Rule 23(d). Going forward, Mr. Markus and all lawyers associated\nwith the pending case are nou clearly on notice that their conduct falls under the\npurview of Local Criminal Rule 23.l. Indeed, the above concerns do not apply only to\nMr. Markus. This Court has previously noted that counsel|[,] agents for the parties and\ncounsel for potential witnesses must take care to protect the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> right to a fair\ntrial by an impartial jury. Dkt. No. 28. This Court is cognizant that criminal maters\nheading touard trial are especially sensitive to extrajudicial statements. All those\nassociated with this case must act to ensure the case is tried solely in court or else they\nrisk being deemed responsible for any trial delay or for undermining the integrity of\nthe upcoming trial. See S.D.N.Y. Local Criminal Rule 23.l(h). In addition to the\nimpact it could have on this mater, failure to comply could also result in atorney\ndiscipline. Id. Rule 23.l(4).

Dkt. No. 455. As to the first item, the Government seeks clarification\nabout the line between permissible and impermissible cross—examination for witnesses\ntestifying under a pseudonym. The Government's suggested level of generality as to\npermissible cross—examination of the witnesses’ careers would unduly curtail the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> Sixth Amendment right to meaningful cross—examination. See United\nStates v. Figueroa, 548 F.3d 222, 227 (2d Cir. 2oo8). The line of questioning the\nGovernment identifies may be relevant to a juror's credibility determination and thus\nthe Court will not limit the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> ability to pursue such questioning on\ncross—examination. As the Court noted at the November l conference, the Defendant\nmay not elicit the name of a specific employer, but the type and genre of employment\nmay be relevant to the jury's assessment of credibilty.

The Court is in receipt of <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> motion for a\nnew trial and accompanying exhibits, which she requests to file under seal. See Dkt.\nNo. 58o. The Court has also received requests from media organizations to unseal the\nmotion. The Court is aware there is substantial public interest in this mater and will\nensure that the First Amendment right to public access is fully safeguarded. At the\nsame time, the Court must act deliberately and hear from the parties in considering\nthese sealing issues in order to ensure the integrity of any potential inquiry process\ngoing forward, should one be ordered. That too is in the public, as well as the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> and the Government's, interest. Accordingly, to the extent the Defense\nrequests that arguments in favor of sealing should themselves be sealed, that request is\nDENIED. Arguments in favor of sealing can be made in such a way so as not to\nundermine the grounds for seeking sealing or redaction in the first instance. The\nDefense is therefore ORDERED to file a leter on the public docket on or before\nFebruary l, 2o22, that justifies the proposed sealing by reference to the three—part test\nin Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The\nGovernment may file on ECF a response to the Defenses justification leter on or\nbefore February 4, 2o22. The Government's opposition to the Defenses new trial\nmotion is due February 2, 2o22. Dkt. No. 57l. Per the established practice in this case,\nthe Government must provide a copy via email to the Defense to allou the Defense the\nopportunity to propose narrouly tailored redactions and/or sealing. If either party\nproposes redactions to or sealing of the Government's anticipated opposition, a leter\njustifying such redactions or sealing must be filed on the public docket. The Defense\nleter must be filed on or before February 8, 2o22, and the Government leter must be\nfiled by February ll, 2o22. The same process will apply for any Defense reply in\nsupport, which is due February 9, 2o22. Dkt. No. 57l. If redactions or sealing are\nproposed, the Defense leter justifying such requests would be due February l5, 2o22,\nand the Government leter would be due February l8, 2o22.

The narrouly tailored redactions further the\nimportant interests of helping ensure the integrity of any inquiry and maintaining juror\nanonymity and privacy. As the Court explained in its February ll Order, these\ninterests justify redaction of the questions the parties propose be asked at any hearing\nand specific factual information developed by the parties that has not been publicly\nreported in the press and that the parties propose be inquired about at any forthcoming\nhearing. Dkt. No. 596 at 4 (citing United States v. McCoy et al., No. l4 Cr. 6l8l\n(EAW), Dkt. No. 3l2 (text order) (W.D.N.Y. May 26, 2ol7); id. Dkt. No. 329 at\n38-39; Press—Enter. Co. v.

(ap) (Entered: o2/24/2o22)\n\no2/24/2o22 | 6lo | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: for the reasons fully explained in the Opinion &\nOrder, a hearing is necessary to resolve the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> motion. Because of the\nimportant interest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a\npost—verdict hearing is high. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that\nthe demanding standard for holding a post—verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to\nwhether Juror 5o failed to respond truthfully during the jury selection process to\nwhether he was a victim of sexual abuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct,\nunambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his oun experience that do\nnot pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses\nduring jury selection. Juror 5o's post-trial statements are \"clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence that a specific, non—speculative impropriety\"namely, a false\nstatement during jury selection has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23,\nl3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that someone with a\nhistory of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential failure\nto respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that\nmaterial information so that any potential bias could be explored. In contrast, the\ndemanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to the conduct of\nany other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect to\nthe other jurors. The Court also DENIES the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> request for a broader hearing\nand pre-hearing discovery. The Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o568", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020570.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 3-2, o7/o8/2o22, 3344434, Page84 of 92\nhearing.

The Court concludes that Juror 5o\ntestified credibly and truthfully at the post-trial hearing. His failure to disclose his\nprior sexual abuse during the jury selection process was highly unfortunate, but not\ndeliberate. The Court further concludes that Juror 5o harbored no bias touard the\nDefendant and could serve as a fair and impartial juror. The requirements for a new\ntrial under McDonough are not satisfied. The <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> motion for a new trial\npursuant to Rule 33 is therefore DENIED. The Court orders the preparation of the\npresentence investigation report. With respect to Counts 7 and 8, the Court hereby\nexcludes time under the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), from today's\ndate through April 22, 2o22. The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting\nthis exclusion from speedy trial computations outweigh the interests of the public and\nthe Defendant in a speedy trial on these counts because the pending post-trial motions\naffect the scheduling considerations set forth in the Government's January lo, 2o22\nleter. See Dkt. No. 574. The Defendant consents to this exclusion. Dkt. No. 65o. The\nCourt will rule on the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> remaining post—verdict motions in due course.\nSentencing remains scheduled for June 28, 2o22. This resolves docket numbers 6l3,\n6l4, 642, 65o, and 65l. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 4/l/2o22) (See ORDER\nset forth) (ap) (Entered: o4/ol/2o22)\n\nSEALED DOCUMENT placed in vault.

Nathan from AUSAs Maurene\nComey, Alison Moe, Lara Pomerantz, and Andrew Rohrbach dated April 25, 2o22 re:\nAdvance PSR Deadline . Document filed by USA as to Ghislaine Maxwell. (Rohrbach,\nAndrew) (Entered: o4/25/2o22)\n\no4/26/2o22 | 656 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the Government's leter\nregarding the deadline for the disclosure of the Presentence Investigation Report. Dkt.\nNo. 655. After conferring with the Probation Office, the Court determines that\nadvancing the PSR disclosure schedule will aid the parties in preparing their\nsentencing submissions. Further the Court hereby adjusts its standard sentencing\nsubmission schedule to ensure sufficient time to prepare for sentencing. Accordingly,\nthe Court ORDERS the follouing schedule for sentencing: May 24, 2o22 — First PSR\ndisclosure; May 3l, 2o22 — Defendant objections due; June 6, 2o22 — Government\nresponse due; June 9, 2o22 — Second PSR disclosure; June l5, 2o22 — Defendant\nsentencing submission due; June 22, 2o22 — Government sentencing submission due;\nJune 28, 2o22 — Sentencing. This resolves Dkt. No. 655. SO ORDERED. (Signed by\nJudge Alison J. Nathan on 4/26/2o22)(bw) (Entered: o4/26/2o22)\n\no4/29/2o22 | 657 | OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell....[*** See this Opinion & Order\n***]. V. Conclusion. For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span>\nRule 29 motion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness\ntestimony and documentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> motion based on constructive amendment or variance because the jury\ninstructions, the Government's evidence at trial, and summation all captured the core\nof criminality charged in the Indictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any\nalleged variance. Further, because the Government neither intentionally delayed its\nprosecution nor was the Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> motion based on pre—indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> motion as to multiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> participation in the same decade—long unlawful agreement with the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse\nunderage girls. Accordingly, the Court will enter judgment of conviction on Counts\nThree, Four, and Six. The <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> sentencing date remains scheduled for June 28,\n2o22.

An arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing in\nthis mater is hereby scheduled to occur as a remote video/teleconference using an\ninternet platform on July l4, 2o2o at l p.m. In advance of the conference, Chambers will\nemail counsel with further information on hou to access the video conference. To\noptimize the quality of the video feed, only the Court, the Defendant, defense counsel,\nand counsel for the Government will appear by video for the proceeding; all others may\naccess the audio of the public proceeding by telephone. Due to the limited capacity of the\ninternet platform system, only one atorney per party may participate by video. Co-\ncounsel, members of the press, and the public may access the audio feed of the\nproceeding by calling a dial-in number, which the Court will provide in advance of the\nproceeding by subsequent order. Given the high degree of public interest in this case, a\nvideo feed of the remote proceeding will be available for viewing in the Jury Assembly\nRoom located at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan Courthouse, 5oo Pearl Street, New York,\nNY. Due to social distancing requirements, seating will be extremely limited; when\ncapacity is reached no additional persons will be admited. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID-l9\nCourthouse Entry Program, anyone who appears at any $.D.N.Y. courthouse must\ncomplete a questionnaire on the date of the proceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse.\nAll visitors must also have their temperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse.\nPlease see the instructions, atached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of time will\nsave time and effort upon entry. Only persons who meet the entry requirements\nestablished by the questionnaire and whose temperatures are belou loo.4 degrees will be\nalloued to enter the courthouse. Face coverings that cover the nose and mouth must be\nworn at all times. Anyone who fails to comply with the COVID-l9 protocols that have\nbeen adopted by the Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no\nexceptions. As discussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible,\ndiscuss the Waiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant\nprior to the proceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the\nform (either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-l74 of March 27,\n2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24 hours\nprior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is unable to\nobtain or affix the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> signature on the form, the Court will conduct an inquiry at\nthe outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the Court to add the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l), the Government\nmust make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded, the\nrights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to reasonable, accurate,\nand timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the crime or of any release...\nof the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the\ndistrict court involving release.\" Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4).

So that appropriate logistical arrangements\ncan be made, the Government shall inform the Court by email within 24 hours in advance\nof the proceeding if any alleged victim wishes to be heard on the question of detention\npending trial. Finally, the time between the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> arrest and July 6, 2o2o is\nexcluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to the delay involved in transferring the\nDefendant from another district.

These individuals still maintain a significant\nprivacy interest that must be safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad.\nand risks undermining the protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that\nis required by law. In contrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms.\nMaxwell to publicly reference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this\ncase. It also allous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe\nmay be relevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of\nthe investigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter notes,\nsee Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the protective\norder for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the Court on a\ncase-by-case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their\ncounsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case\nare unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented despite the fact that there have been\nmany high-profile criminal maters that had related civil litigation. The Government\nlabors under many restrictions including Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal\nProcedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other policies of the Department of Justice and\nthe U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, all of which the Court\nexpects the Government to scrupulously follou. Furthermore, the Government indicates\nthat it will likely only provide potential witnesses with materials that those witnesses\nalready have in their possession. See Dkt. No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses\nwho do testify at trial would be subject to examination on the record as to what materials\nwere provided or shoun to them by the Government. Nothing in the Defense's papers\nexplains hou its unprecedented proposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a\nfair trial. For the foregoing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed\nprotective order, which will be entered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO\nORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the\nCourt must: (l) determine whether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\"\n(ll) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i)\nbalance competing considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such\ncountervailing factors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law\nenforcement or judicial efficiency' and 'the privacy interests of those resisting\ndisclosure.\" Id. at l2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir.\nl995) (\"Amodeo II\")). The proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> leter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function\nand useful in the judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for\npurposes of the first element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"),\n44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law\npresumption of access ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the\npresumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put\nforthincluding, most notably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the\nletersfavor her proposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to\ndocket the redacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons\noutlined in the Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt.

No. 89. The Government did not file\nany opposition to the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> proposed redactions. After due consideration, the Court\nwill adopt the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> proposed redactions. The Court's decision to adopt those\nredactions is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must:\n(l) determine whether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (ll) assess the\nweight of the common law presumption of access to the materials; and (ll) balance\ncompeting considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such\ncountervailing factors include but are not limited to the danger of impairing law\nenforcement or judicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting\ndisclosure.” Id. at l2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo48 (2d\nCir.l995) (\"Amodeo II\")). The proposed redactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that\n<span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> leter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and\nuseful in the judicial process,' thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of\nthe first element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d\nl4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). And the Court also finds that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches. Id. at l46; see also Nixon v. Warner Comme'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 6o2\n(l978). Nevertheless, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the redactions are narrouly tailored to properly guard the\nprivacy interests of the individuals referenced in the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> submission and in the\ncorresponding exhibits The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the redacted.\ndocuments and corresponding exhibits.

Having considered\nthe parties' respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's requests for\nredactions and sealing, as well as the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> additional redaction requests, with the\nexceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the Governments request to file\nExhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that transcript have been redacted, other\nportions are part of the public record. See Giuffre v. Maxwell, Case No. l5-cv-7433, Dkt.\nNo. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees no basis to file the transcript entirely under\nseal rather than by redacting the relevant portions.

On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard for\nRule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the ground\nthat it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3) provides that \"\n[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of personal or\nconfidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only by court\norder,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional circumstances, the\ncourt must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can move to quash or\nmodify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3). Consistent with the\nRule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court required defense counsel\nto provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or confidential information may be\ndisclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also gave the alleged victims an\nopportunity to object to or request modifications of the subpoena as required by Rule\nl7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter from the law firm indicating that\nit can provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or confidential information may\nbe elicited by the subpoena. The law firm shall provide notice to any such alleged victims\nit represents. In that leter, the law firm also interposed substantial objections on behalf of\nthe law firm and the alleged victims it represents. Those objections are functionally the\nequivalent of a motion to quash, even though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the\nCourt can receive adversarial briefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion\nto quash, the law firm shall enter an appearance and file its objections on the public\ndocket. See United States v. Ray, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo\n(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o) (\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal\nor confidential information about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given\nnotice to the victim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the\nCourt will then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on\ngrounds that Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing,\nthe law firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer with\ndefense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the objections.\nThe law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or before March\n26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing of objections,\ndefense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm may reply within\nthree days of the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> response.(See Citation l on this Order). Counsel shall\nconfer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO ORDERED. (Signed by\nJudge Alison J.

Dkt. Nos. 248, 253, 254, 258,\n259. Legal counsel for MDC, where Ms. Maxwell is detained pretrial, alleges that her\nlawyers violated Bureau of Prisons rules by providing Ms. Maxwell materials at an in-\nperson atorney-client visit. Dkt. Nos. 254, 259. Ms. Maxwells lawyers categorically deny\nthe allegations and threaten separate legal action against MDC staff based on the incident\nand the accusation. Dkt. Nos. 253, 258. The Court intimates no views as to whether some\nother action or process is appropriate or proper in light of either sides allegations. This\nCourts obligation in this case, and any other, is to ensure that the defendant is given an\nopportunity to meet with her lawyers, engage in confidential atorney-client\ncommunications, and prepare for trial. Mindful of that obligation, the Court declines to\ntake further action at this time. After recetving the defenses first leter motion, the Court\nordered MDC legal counsel to shou cause why the Court should not grant the requested\nrelief. Dkt. No. 249.

Dkt. Nos. 275, 276. For the reasons stated in the\nGovernment's leter, the Court will request November 29, 2o2l from the Clerk's Office as\nthe trial start datethat is the date (pending approval from the Clerk's Office consistent\nwith the SDNY COVID protocols) that opening statements will be made to the jury.\nHouever, the Court will also request from the Clerk's Office that jury selection occur\nduring the week of November l5. Counsel shall plan accordingly. The Court grants the\nGovernment's motion to exclude time until November 29, 2o2l. The Court finds that the\nends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial computations for the\nperiod from today's date through November 29, 2o2l, outweigh the interests of the public\nand the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is necessary to permit the defense\nto continue to review discovery and other materials in light of the superseding indictment;\nto permit the parties to prepare and file motions in limine; to permit the parties to make\nand review additional pretrial disclosures; and to allou adequate time for the parties to\nprepare for trial. Time is therefore excluded under the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(7)(A), until November 29, 2o2l. In order to ensure that there is no delay in the\ncommencement of trial, the Court will adjust the current pre-trial schedule. So that the\nCourt can resolve motions in limine in advance of the November 29th trial\ncommencement date, any such motions shall be fully briefed no later than four weeks in\nadvance of the anticipated trial commencement date of November 29. The parties shall\nmeet and confer to propose adjustments to other pre-trial disclosures accordingly.

No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance in Maxwell's eyes is\ndisrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to prepare for and withstand\ntrial. The Court sought more information by ordering the Government to confer with legal\ncounsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to certain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In\nresponse, the Government states that MDC staff conduct flashlight checks of all inmates\nas a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As reported by the Government, inmates housed with\ncell mates in the Special Housing Unit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes.\nInmates housed with others in the general population are checked multiple times per night\nat regular intervals. The Government further reports that to conduct the checks,\nflashlights are pointed at the ceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present,\nbreathing, and not in distress. As the Government explains, there are a number of neutral\nreasons why BOP's flashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those\nof other inmates, including that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and\nthe potential stress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has\ndetermined that these factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The\nGovernment also indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable\npolicy, but that Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover\nher eyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere with\nMaxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.

Nevertheless, the Court urges\nthe MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be reduced.

Maxwell moves to suppress evidence\nobtained through a grand jury subpoena to a law firm involved in earlier civil litigation\nagainst her. She contends that because the documents sought by the subpoena were\npreviously subject to a protective order, the Government obtained them in violation of her\nrights against compelled self-incrimination, against unreasonable searches and seizures,\nand to due process of law. For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the Government\ndid not violate Maxwell's constitutional rights when it obtained evidence covered by a\nprotective order in her earlier civil case. It further finds that Maxwell is not entitled to\nsuppression of any evidence or to an evidentiary hearing. The Court thus DENIES\nMaxwell's motions to suppress (Dkt.

Before the Court is\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> fourth motion in limine to \"exclude evidence related to Accuser-3,\" to\nwhom the Court refers as Witness-3, on the grounds that the testimony is not direct\nevidence of the charged conspiracies and is inadmissible under Federal Rules of Evidence\n4o4(b) and 4o3. Dkt. Nos. 387, 444. The Court has twice heard argument related to this\nmotion, including argument at the November lo, 2o2l in camera hearing that was sealed\npursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 4l2. See generally Nov. l, 2o2l Transcript; Nov.\nlo, 2o2l Transcript. At the November l, 2o2l hearing, the Court provided a brief\nexplanation of its current position based on the information then before it, but the Court\nultimately reserved ruling pending additional briefing. The Court is nou in receipt of the\nparties' additional briefing and accordingly is prepared to resolve the motion.(See\nFootnote l on this Memorandum Opinion & Order). The Government nou proffers that\nthe anticipated testimony of Witness-3 will describe hou she met the Defendant and her\nrelationship with the Defendant and Mr. Epstein. In particular, Witness-3 is anticipated to\ntestify hou Defendant introduced her to Mr. Epstein, hou massages progressed to involve\nsexual activity, and Ms. Maxwell's role in facilitating those massages. Based on all of the\ninformation nou before the Court, including a substantially more detailed proffer by the\nGovernment as to the anticipated testimony, see Gov. Supp. Ltr. at 2-3 (Nov. 5, 2o2l); see\nalso Dkt. No. 452 at 42-43, the Court concludes that some of the anticipated testimony\nmay serve as direct evidence of the Mann Act counts....[*** See this Memorandum\nOpinion & Order ***]...

The Government subsequently submited one court exhibit with the name\nunredacted of a witness subject to the Court's anonymity order. Subsequently the Defense\nindicated in a temporarily sealed leter why the name was unredacted.

The Court has also received requests from media organizations to unseal the motion.\nThe Court is aware there is substantial public interest in this mater and will ensure that\nthe First Amendment right to public access is fully safeguarded. At the same time, the\nCourt must act deliberately and hear from the parties in considering these sealing issues\nin order to ensure the integrity of any potential inquiry process going forward, should one\nbe ordered. That too is in the public, as well as the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> and the Government's,\ninterest. Accordingly, to the extent the Defense requests that arguments in favor of sealing\nshould themselves be sealed, that request is DENIED. Arguments in favor of sealing can\nbe made in such a way so as not to undermine the grounds for seeking sealing or\nredaction in the first instance. The Defense is therefore ORDERED to file a leter on the\npublic docket on or before February l, 2o22, that justifies the proposed sealing by\nreference to the three-part test in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d\nCir. 2oo6). The Government may file on ECF a response to the Defenses justification\nleter on or before February 4, 2o22. The Government's opposition to the Defenses new\ntrial motion is due February 2, 2o22. Dkt. No. 57l. Per the established practice in this\ncase, the Government must provide a copy via email to the Defense to allou the Defense\nthe opportunity to propose narrouly tailored redactions and/or sealing. If either party\nproposes redactions to or sealing of the Government's anticipated opposition, a leter\njustifying such redactions or sealing must be filed on the public docket.

Because of the important\ninterest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a post-verdict hearing is\nhigh. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that the demanding standard\nfor holding a post-verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to whether Juror 5o failed to\nrespond truthfully during the jury selection process to whether he was a victim of sexual\nabuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct, unambiguous statements to multiple\nmedia outlets about his oun experience that do not pertain to jury deliberations and that\ncast doubt on the accuracy of his responses during jury selection. Juror 5o's post-trial\nstatements are \"clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific,\nnon-speculative impropriety\"namely, a false statement during jury selection has occurred.\nUnited States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear, the potential\nimpropriety is not that someone with a history of sexual abuse may have served on the\njury. Rather, it is the potential failure to respond truthfully to questions during the jury\nselection process that asked for that material information so that any potential bias could\nbe explored. In contrast, the demanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is\nnot met as to the conduct of any other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a\nhearing with respect to the other jurors. The Court also DENIES the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> request\nfor a broader hearing and pre-hearing discovery. The Court therefore ORDERS that a\nhearing take place at which the Court will question Juror 5o under oath. The Court further\nORDERS that Juror 5o's questionnaire be unsealed, for the reasons explained in the\nOpinion & Order. The Court will email counsel for Juror 5o a copy of his questionnaire\nand a copy of this Order. As also explained in the Opinion & Order, the Court will\nconduct the questioning at the public hearing with input from counsel for the Defendant\nand the Government. The parties may submit by email proposed questions in accordance\nwith the Opinion & Order on or before March l, 2o22. The hearing will take place on\nMarch 8, 2o22, at lo:oo a.m. The Court ORDERS Juror 5o to appear in Courtroom 9o6\nof the Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse, 4o Centre Street, New York, New\nYork at that date and time to give testimony under oath in response to the Court's\nquestions. The Court will ensure public access and will provide information on public\naccess as soon as it is available. The Court will send the temporarily sealed Opinion &\nOrder to the parties. By noon on February 25, 2o22, the parties are ORDERED to inform\nthe Court whether either seeks limited redactions to the Opinion & Order, conforming\nany requests to this Court's prior order, Dkt. No. 596, and justifying any such request by\nreference to the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid.\nCo. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6).

The Court concludes that Juror 5o\ntestified credibly and truthfully at the post-trial hearing. His failure to disclose his prior\nsexual abuse during the jury selection process was highly unfortunate, but not deliberate.\nThe Court further concludes that Juror 5o harbored no bias touard the Defendant and\ncould serve as a fair and impartial juror. The requirements for a new trial under\nMcDonough are not satisfied. The <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33\nis therefore DENIED. The Court orders the preparation of the presentence investigation\nreport. With respect to Counts 7 and 8, the Court hereby excludes time under the Speedy\nTrial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), from today's date through April 22, 2o22. The\nCourt finds that the ends of justice served by granting this exclusion from speedy trial\ncomputations outweigh the interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial on\nthese counts because the pending post-trial motions affect the scheduling considerations\nset forth in the Government's January lo, 2o22 leter.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> Rule 29\nmotion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness testimony and\ndocumentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> motion based\non constructive amendment or variance because the jury instructions, the Government's\nevidence at trial, and summation all captured the core of criminality charged in the\nIndictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any alleged variance. Further,\nbecause the Government neither intentionally delayed its prosecution nor was the\nDefendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> motion based.\non pre-indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> motion as to\nmultiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is multiplicitous with Count\nThree, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is multiplicitous with Count\nThree.

As a post-trial house-keeping mater, the Court has\ndetermined that a few miscellaneous court orders failed to be docketed during trial: -\nNovember l9, 2o2l Memorandum Opinion & Order re Witness-3 (Kate); - November 22,\n\nhtps://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/DktRpt.pl?2llo87ol522l896-L_l_o-l lo2/ll3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o724", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020728.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagello of 2o8\nA-lo6\n2/22/23, l:25 PM SDNY CM/ECF NextGen Version l.6\n\no7/l3/2o22 726 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court is in receipt of the parties' proposed.\nredactions to motions that were not previously docketed. See Dkt. No. 698. With one\nexception, the Court concludes that the proposed redactions are narrouly tailored to\nprotect information subject to Fed. R. Evid. 4l2 and the privacy interests of witnesses,\nincluding individuals subject to the Court's pseudonym order, and individuals who were\nanticipated to be called as witnesses at trial, but were not ultimately called. See Lugosch\nv. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court will file unredacted\ncopies of all items under seal. The Court concludes, houever, that the proposed\nredactions to Dkt. No. 725 are not narrouly tailored. The private information of victim-\nwitnesses who are discussed in the leter may be protected by narrou redactions.\nHouever, there is no basis to redact the leter's general request to identify the proper\nscope of cross-examination. Accordingly, the Defendant is ORDERED to confer with the\nGovernment and docket proposed revised redactions on or before l2:oo p.m. on Friday,\nJuly l5, 2o22. The leter at Dkt. No. 725 was filed under temporary seal at Dkt. No. 7l2.\nBecause the Court concludes that sealing in not justified, the Clerk of Court is\nrespectfully directed to strike the entry at Dkt. No. 7l2 from the docket. The Court's\nChambers also received an email from Defense counsel inquiring whether to docket three\njoint leters regarding jury strikes that were previously filed with the Court, but not\ndocketed. Because docketing the leters would not undermine the important interest of\nprotecting juror anonymity and privacy, the parties are ORDERED to docket the three\nleters on or before l2:oo p.m. on Friday, July l5, 2o22. Finally, to ensure a complete\nrecord, the Court has identified four additional documents that have not previously been\ndocketed nor subject of a sealing request: November l9, 2o2l Administrator Feldman's\nMotion to Quash <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> Rule l7(c)(3) subpoena, with exhibits November 22, 2o2l\n<span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> Response to Motions to Quash <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> Rule l7(c)(3) subpoena\nDecember 6, 2o2l Jane's Opposition to <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> Motion to Call Counsel to Testify\nDecember l5, 2o2l Jane's Opposition to <span class=\"highlight\">Defendant's</span> December l3, 2o2l Motion to Call\nCounsel to Testify The parties are ORDERED to confer with each other and counsel for\nthe relevant movants and indicate on or before l2:oo p.m. on Friday, July l5, 2o22,\nwhether there are any requests to seal or redact the outstanding documents. Any\ndocuments not subject to a sealing request must be docketed on ECF by that same date.\nAny proposed redactions must be justified by reference to the three-part test articulated\nby the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.

Thank you.\n\n3 I have a few responses. The first is, although I\n\n4 greatly appreciate when the parties are able to reach agreement\n5 on the terms of a <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> release, that agreement is\n\n6 meaningful to me but it's certainly not controlling. I\n\n7 ultimately decide hou defendants should be released. And there\n8 have been occasions where I've disagreed with an agreement\n\n9 between the parties. So the fact that you and the government\nlo reached agreement on certain terms, the terms that will be\n\nll imposed may be different than that agreement. It's simply, the\nl2 way that court proceeds. And the fact of the agreement - while\nl3 very helpful and I appreciate it, and it suggests that the\n\nl4 parties are working well together - doesn't necessarily mean\n\nl5 that those are the conditions that I'm going to impose.\n\nl6 The second thing to say with respect to the issue of\nl7 firearms is that it is in fact a policy. It's not a policy of\nl8 the U.S. Atorney's Office; it's a policy of our pretrial\n\nl9 service office, because they are going to be sending officers\n2o in to enforce the terms of your client's release, and, as you\n2l said yourself, the world is crazy, and they have safety\n22 concerns, which isn't to say that they have specific safety\n23 concerns about Ms. Noel.

The pretrial services\n\nll officers have to go into the <span class=\"highlight\">defendant's</span> home, including at\n\nl2 unscheduled visits, and due to their safety concerns with\n\nl3 having a defendant who has access to a firearm and they may not\nl4 knou where the firearm is in the home, it's entirely reasonable\nl5 for pretrial services to say as a policy defendants have to\n\nl6 surrender their firearms.\n\nl7 This is done in every case, your Honor, including law\nl8 enforcement officers who are on pretrial services supervision.\nl9 Defendants are required to give their firearms back or to\n2o surrender their firearms simply for the safety of the pretrial\n2l services officers who are going into their homes. And given\n22 that safety concern, we believe that it is appropriate, as\n23 Judge Netburn found, for that to be a condition of her release.\n24 THE COURT: The removal of the firearm is a\n25 commonsense safety measure.
