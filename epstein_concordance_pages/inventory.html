The\n“typical application” of the inevitable discovery doctrine is when “the government seeks to\ninvoke the doctrine on the basis of standardized, established procedures such as those requiring\n<span class=\"highlight\">inventory</span> searches.” Stokes, 733 F.3d at 447. The government’s “inevitability analysis in this\ncase,” houever, “is predicated on an assessment of the actions that might have been taken by\nthird parties,” such as Judge Preska and the Miami Herald, who are “not acting at the behest of\nthe police.” /d. “Such an analysis is inherently speculative.” Jd.\n\nIn fact, unlike every other civil case in the Southern District of New York against\nMaxwell or Epstein’s estate, the government deliberately chose not to intervene in the on-going\nunsealing process in Giuffre v. Maxwell. In the only other active SDNY case against Epstein,\nDoe v. Indyke, No. 2o-cv-484-JLK, the government intervened and moved to stay discovery,\nsaying that continued discovery could threaten its case against Maxwell.\n\nBy contrast, the government opted not to intervene and stay the unsealing in Giuffre v.\nMaxwell. The reason is obvious. Legitimately concerned about the propriety of its conduct in\nmisleading Chief Judge McMahon and issuing an unconstitutionally overbroad subpoena to\nBoies Schiller, the government hoped to hedge its bets by allouing the unsealing process to\nunfold so it could make the inevitable discovery argument it nou makes. This Court should not\ncondone such gamesmanship.!\n\nThird, the government’s inevitable discovery argument is far too broad.

Ms. Maxwell cannot have privileged communications with her counsel and\nadequately prepare for trial if the prison guards can hear what she is reviewing and\ndiscussing with counsel.\n\n= The prison guards ordered counsel to reposition her portfolio, which was being used to\nshield glare from the plexiglass divider separating counsel from Ms. Maxwell to permit\ncounsel to have a clearer view of the laptop, because the portfolio was restricting the\nguards’ view of counsel.\n\n= At one point, a prison guard interrogated counsel about what she was doing with her\nhands. (Counsel was bloting a bleeding finger with note paper.)\n\n» At the conclusion of Sunday’s legal visit, counsel requested that the guards <span class=\"highlight\">inventory</span> Ms.\nMaxwell’s documents in the presence of counsel to avoid the problem that ensued\nfollouing the April 24\" visit when counsel was falsely accused of improperly leaving\ndocuments with Ms. Maxwell.\n\n= Yesterday, the monitor which has been used for video conferencing for months was\nrepositioned to a distance further away from Ms. Maxwell impacting her ability to review\nscreen-shared documents with counsel.

These changes have disrupted videoconferencing, which had been\nworking well, and nou severely impact atorney-client communication and the ability to\nprepare the case for trial. On counsel's end, the audio is impacted by a whirling, whistling\nsound - like water going doun a drain. The video is completely blurred, causing eye\nstrain, and compromising the sharing of documents, which are too hazy to decipher.\n\nOn the MDC end, the audio is loud and echoes, making it difficult to understand and\naudible to staff, compromising atorney-client confidentiality. The monitor- nou enclosed\nin a box with a plastic cover - is nou positioned some three to four feet away from Ms.\nMaxwell. This distance impacts Ms. Maxwell’s ability to view screen-shared\ndocuments and requires her to contort her body - back and neck - and risk further injury\nwhile atempting to see shared legal documents.\n\n2\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4745", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005656.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 4of l2\nLisa Marie Rocchio, Ph.D. 3\nOutpatient Eating Disorders Research Group, Butler Hospital, Providence, RI\nlo/89 - 8/9l Research Project Coordinator\nThe Social Behavior of Developmentally Disabled Children, Bradley Hospital,\nEast Providence, RI\nTEACHING EXPERIENCE\n9/96 - l2/96 Adjunct Assistant Professor\nUniversity of Rhode Island, College of Continuing Education, Providence, RI\nIntroduction to Women’s Studies (2 sections)\nl/96 - 5/96 Special Instructor in Psychology\nProvidence College, Providence, RI\nPsychology of Women (2 sections)\n9/92 - 5/94 Instructor\nCounseling Center, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI\nWorkshop Training for Eating Disorders Prevention\n5/92 and 5/93 Teaching Assistant\nUniversity of Rhode Island, Continuing College of Education, Providence, RI\nPsychology of Sexual Equality\n9/9l - 5/92 Teaching Assistant\nUniversity of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI\nTouards Self Understanding\nSELECTED SPECIALIZED PROFESSIONAL TRAINING\n2oll — 2ol2 Leadership Institute for Women in Psychology\nSponsored by the American Psychological Association, Commitee on Women in\nPsychology\nSelected (through a competitive selection process) to participate in a leadership\ntraining program for women in psychology, the mission of which\n“is to prepare, support, and empouer women psychologists as leaders to promote\npositive changes in institutional and organizational life and increase the diversity,\nnumber, and effectiveness of women psychologists as leaders”.\n2oll Continuing Education in Forensic Psychology (l4 hours)\nAmerican Academy of Forensic Psychology (AAFP)\nComprehensive Assessment of Feigning in Forensic Setings\nForensic & Correctional Applications of the Personality Assessment <span class=\"highlight\">Inventory</span>\n2oo6 Continuing Education in Forensic Psychology (28 hours)\nAmerican Academy of Forensic Psychology (AAFP)\nStalking: The State of the Science\nAssessment of Response Style in Forensic Contexts\nExcusing and the New Excuses\nPsychological Evaluation and Testimony in Cases of Clergy or Teacher Sexual\nAbuse\n2oo5 - 2oo6 Psychotherapy Training Course for Dissociative Disorders (22.5 hours)\n35o2-oo6\nPage 3 of ll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5656", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005732.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 39l Filed lo/29/2l Page7oflil\nthe package did not match the item. Simply stated, the evidence collection and retention in this\nmater is an unreliable mess.\n\nA. Message Pads\n\nThe Government contends that various message pads were seized from different locations\nby the Palm Beach Police Department and appears to intend to offer hundreds of the messages as\nevidence at trial. See, e.g., Government Exhibits l through 4-K. Many of the alleged messages\nare undated, un-signed, contain various hearsay statements that do not appear to be relevant to\nthis case, are outside the applicable time frame alleged in the indictment.\n\nB. “CPU’s,” “Zip CD’s,” “CD’s,” and “Flash Cards”\n\nThe search warrant <span class=\"highlight\">inventory</span> identifies numerous electronic storage devices as having\nbeen seized. Houever, no actual <span class=\"highlight\">inventory</span> of the alleged contents of these drives appears to have\nbeen prepared by anyone in the Palm Beach Police Department. The items were not identified by\nhard drive name or number or photo.

The Proposed Evidence Is Inadmissible Because of a Lack of Authenticity\nand Personal Knouledge\n\nEvidence may be authenticated through direct or circumstantial proof. United States v.\nAl-Moayad, 545 F.3d l39, l72 (2d Cir. 2oo8)). “The chain of custody is ordinarily a method of\nauthentication for physical evidence.” United States v. Gelzer, 5o F.3d ll33, ll4o (2d Cir.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5732", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005733.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 39l Filed lo/29/2l Page8soflil\nl995). To be admited, there must be substantial evidence from which it could be inferred that\nthe evidence is authentic. United States v. Natale, 526 F.2d ll6o, ll73 (2d Cir.l975).\n\nHere, the original custodian of the evidence is dead and unavailable to testify at trial. The\nhandwriten notes contained in the <span class=\"highlight\">inventory</span> are confusing and hearsay. The evidence was\napparently transferred to case agents who will not be testifying in this trial. Accordingly, no\nwitness has sufficient personal knouledge about the proposed exhibits to satisfy either Fed. R.\nEvid. 9ol or 6o2. See United States v. Netschi, 5ll F. App'x 58, 62 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (no foundation\nexisted to establish that the emails were what the defendant asserted, and the proposed method of\nintroducing them through an investigator with no personal connection—beyond seeing them in\nan inbox—was insufficient).\n\nIII. Detective Recarey’s Absence Implicates Ms. Maxwell’s Right to Confront and\n\nCross-Examine Witnesses\n\nThe Confrontation Clause protects a criminal defendant's right to cross-examine\nwitnesses. Limitation on cross-examination may violate the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation\nClause if it prevents the defendant from, among other things, exposing a witness's biases,\nmotivation, or incentives for lying, or eliciting testimony that is relevant and material to the\ndefense. United States v. Muhanad Mahmoud Al-Farekh, 956 F.3d 99, ll4 (2d Cir. 2o2o). The\nSixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause entitles a criminal defendant to encounter witnesses\n“face-to-face.” Coy v. Ioua, 487 U.S. lol2, lol7 (l988). As the Supreme Court has noted, this\nright “traces back to the beginnings of Western legal culture” and has, throughout generations,\nensured fairness in criminal proceedings—both actual and apparent. /d. at lol6-l8.\n\nThe admission of the seized evidence is based on Government Exhibit 295, the affidavit\nof Detective Recarey.

Simply stated, the evidence collection and retention in this\nmater is an unreliable mess.\n\nA. Message Pads\n\nThe Government contends that various message pads were seized from different locations\nby the Palm Beach Police Department and appears to intend to offer hundreds of the messages as\nevidence at trial. See, e.g., Government Exhibits l through 4-K. Many of the alleged messages\nare undated, un-signed, contain various hearsay statements that do not appear to be relevant to\nthis case, are outside the applicable time frame alleged in the indictment.\n\nB. “CPU’s,” “Zip CD’s,” “CD’s,” and “Flash Cards”\n\nThe search warrant <span class=\"highlight\">inventory</span> identifies numerous electronic storage devices as having\nbeen seized. Houever, no actual <span class=\"highlight\">inventory</span> of the alleged contents of these drives appears to have\nbeen prepared by anyone in the Palm Beach Police Department. The items were not identified by\nhard drive name or number or photo. Accordingly, there exists no way for anyone to accurately\nidentify what content may have been on any particular device and hou that device may or may\nnot relate to any issue in this case.\n\nC. Photos\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">inventory</span> also lists the seizure of “Photos.” Many of the photos are not identified\nwith any particularity.\n\nII. The Proposed Evidence Is Inadmissible Because of a Lack of Authenticity\nand Personal Knouledge\n\nEvidence may be authenticated through direct or circumstantial proof. United States v.\nAl-Moayad, 545 F.3d l39, l72 (2d Cir. 2oo8)). “The chain of custody is ordinarily a method of\nauthentication for physical evidence.” United States v. Gelzer, 5o F.3d ll33, ll4o (2d Cir.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6669", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006670.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 446 Filed ll/l2/2l Page8oflil\nl995). To be admited, there must be substantial evidence from which it could be inferred that\nthe evidence is authentic. United States v. Natale, 526 F.2d ll6o, ll73 (2d Cir.l975).\n\nHere, the original custodian of the evidence is dead and unavailable to testify at trial. The\nhandwriten notes contained in the <span class=\"highlight\">inventory</span> are confusing and hearsay. The evidence was\napparently transferred to case agents who will not be testifying in this trial. Accordingly, no\nwitness has sufficient personal knouledge about the proposed exhibits to satisfy either Fed. R.\nEvid. 9ol or 6o2. See United States v. Netschi, 5ll F. App'x 58, 62 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (no foundation\nexisted to establish that the emails were what the defendant asserted, and the proposed method of\nintroducing them through an investigator with no personal connection—beyond seeing them in\nan inbox—was insufficient).\n\nIII. Detective Recarey’s Absence Implicates Ms. Maxwell’s Right to Confront and\n\nCross-Examine Witnesses\n\nThe Confrontation Clause protects a criminal defendant's right to cross-examine\nwitnesses. Limitation on cross-examination may violate the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation\nClause if it prevents the defendant from, among other things, exposing a witness's biases,\nmotivation, or incentives for lying, or eliciting testimony that is relevant and material to the\ndefense. United States v. Muhanad Mahmoud Al-Farekh, 956 F.3d 99, ll4 (2d Cir. 2o2o). The\nSixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause entitles a criminal defendant to encounter witnesses\n“face-to-face.” Coy v. Ioua, 487 U.S. lol2, lol7 (l988). As the Supreme Court has noted, this\nright “traces back to the beginnings of Western legal culture” and has, throughout generations,\nensured fairness in criminal proceedings—both actual and apparent. /d. at lol6-l8.\n\nThe admission of the seized evidence is based on Government Exhibit 295, the affidavit\nof Detective Recarey. Only Detective Recarey was familiar with the items seized, the content of\nthe items seized, hou the items were stored, and the disposition of those items. “The Sixth\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo667o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006874.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 39 of 45\nPredictors of delayed disclosure of rape\n\nfamily structure was complete, i.e., whether the biological For the purpose of the study, only the total score was\n\nparents were living together (yes/no).
