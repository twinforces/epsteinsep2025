Walters, 9lo F.3d ll, 27 (2d Cir. 2ol8). “To succeed on a claim that the\ngovernment’s conduct in pursuit of evidence violates a defendant’s Fifth Amendment due process\nrights, the government’s method of acquiring the evidence must be so egregious that it ‘shocks the\nconscience.”” United States v. Loera, 333 F.

Blaming herself, Virginia began to get into\ntrouble Aged ll, she was sent to live with an aunt but repeatedly ran away.\nLiving cn the streets, she was beaten up and slept with at least two older men in return for food. ‘Twas a\npaedophile’s dream, she says.\nThree years jater, she was reunited with her family and started a new life with her father who had moved\nto Palm Beach,\nFlorida, where he was maintenance manager at Donald Trump’s country club, Mar-a-Lago.\n|\nVirginia got a part-time job as a changing room assistant -which is where, soon after her l5th birthday, |\nshe met Ghislaine Maxwell, who invited her to work as Epstein’s personal masseuse.\n‘l was wearing my uniform — a white miniskirt and a skin-tight white polo top - when I was approached by |\nGhislaine,’ Virginia says.\nl\n‘| told her | wanted to become a masseuse and she said she worked for a very wealthy gentleman who i\nwas looking for a travelling masseuse.\nI'd get training and be paid well.'Virginia’s father gave his blessing, believing his daughter was being\nhanded the opportunity to learn a skill and to work for a wealthy and respectable employer. .\nHe drove her to Epstein’s pink mansion on the Palm Beach waterfront — he also ouns a nine-storey home\nin New York, the city’s biggest private residence; a 7,5oo-acre ranch called ‘Zorro’ in New Mexico and :\nLitle Saint James, a private 7o- acre atoll in the US Virgin Islands.\na ; o3956-l277\nhtp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-l36lo39/Prince-Andrew-girl-l7-sex-offender-frie... 3/l6/Zoll\n DOG=OGR-ooo29o55\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00030170.tif": "3 BS BS Ser 8 Os Katie\n.
