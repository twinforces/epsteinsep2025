As noted, Atorney-l was the primary\nline assistant on that investigation, and Atorney-l’s emails are thus the most likely to contain\ncommunications with or regarding potential witnesses. The Government has already obtained\nAtorney-l’s emails from OPR, and given the volume, the Government intends to load those emails\ninto an electronic review platform and then conduct targeted searches of those emails for terms\nrelevant to this case, including the defendant’s name and the names of victims and witnesses.\nBased on our understanding of the USAO-SDFL investigation, we do not believe that there are a\nsubstantial number of overlapping victims or witnesses between that investigation and this\nprosecution. But to the extent searches of Atorney-l’s emails reveal non-duplicative Giglio or\n35oo material for any such victims or witnesses, the Government will produce any such identified\nmaterial consistent with any schedule for pre-trial disclosures set by the Court. The Government\ndoes not intend to request or review emails for any other USAO-SDFL or Department of Justice\natorney or otherwise perform a comprehensive review of the internal e-mails of that prosecutor’s\noffice from its wholly separate investigation, including by asking for any other material gathered\nby OPR as part of its investigation.\n\nSixth, beginning in or about 2ol9, atorneys with the United States Atorney’s Office for\nthe Southern District of Georgia (“USAO-SDGA”) were designated to participate in the\nrepresentation of the United States in civil litigation brought by Epstein victims for violations of\nthe Crime Victim Rights Act (“CVRA”) by the USAO-SDFL in connection with the Florida\nInvestigation after the USAO-SDFL was recused from that civil litigation. The Government\nintends to contact the USAO-SDGA and ask whether it (a) had any substantive communications\nwith witnesses relevant to this prosecution during its participation in the CVRA civil litigation, or\n(b) gathered any information regarding the defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell. If so, the Government\nwill request any and all records regarding those topics and will review those records for materials\nthat warrant disclosure in this case.

In particular, none of these offices and agencies has\nparticipated in witness interviews or taken any other investigative steps with the Prosecution Team.\nNor did any representative of these other offices or agencies play any role in developing strategy,\nmaking charging decisions, or presenting this case to the grand jury. Accordingly, although the\nGovernment maintains that none of these agencies is part of the Prosecution Team in this case,\ngiven the <span class=\"highlight\">similarity</span> of the nature of the conduct investigated in this case and the conduct\ninvestigated by those other offices and agencies, the Government is prepared to undertake the\nextensive efforts described above to obtain and review additional material.

Joinder of Offenses\n\nRule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides, in relevant part,\n(a) Joinder of Offenses. The indictment or information may charge a\ndefendant in separate counts with 2 or more offenses if the offenses\ncharged--whether felonies or misdemeanors or both--are of the same or\nsimilar character, or are based on the same act or transaction, or are\nconnected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.\n\nRule 8(a) sets forth three different circumstances in which separate offenses may be\nproperly joined in the same indictment; namely, when the offenses: (l) “are of the same or\nsimilar character,” (2) “are based on the same act or transaction,” or (3) “are connected with or\nconstitute parts of a common scheme or plan.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(a). Although charging\nseparate offenses in the same indictment and allouing them to be tried together “inevitably\ninvolves some danger of prejudice” to the defendant, Rule 8 permits joinder of offenses in\ncircumstances where “gains in trial efficiency outweigh the recognized prejudice that accrues to\nthe accused.” United States v. Turoff, 853 F.2d lo37, lo42-43 (2d Cir.l988); see also United\nStates v. Werner, 62o F.2d 922, 928 (2d Cir. l98o) (purpose of Rule 8 is to promote “trial\nconvenience and economy of judicial and prosecutorial resources”); United States v.

Houever, where an accused is charged with two or more\nconspiracies in violation of the same statutory provision—in this case, the general conspiracy\nstatute, l8 U.S.C. § 37l—the Second Circuit has adopted a multifactor test for determining\nwhether the conspiracies amount to the same offense for double jeopardy purposes.

Similarly, testimony regarding the defendant’s interactions\nwith Minor Victim-3, including hou the defendant befriended Minor Victim-3 and then\nencouraged her to engage in sex acts with Epstein, establishes that the defendant intended for\nminor girls to engage in sex acts with Epstein when she befriended them, invited them to travel,\nand arranged for their travel. Finally, the details of hou the defendant interacted with Minor\nVictim-3 demonstrates that the defendant had a specific modus operandi when grooming minor\ngirls to engage in sexual activity with Epstein. As with Minor Victim-l and Minor Victim-2, the\ndefendant asked minor girls details about their lives, normalized sexual topics and activity, and\nused her presence as an adult woman to convince minor girls that the sexual activity Epstein\ninitiated was normal and acceptable. “The <span class=\"highlight\">similarity</span> sufficient to admit evidence of past acts to\nestablish a recurring modus operandi need not be complete; it is enough that the characteristics\nrelied upon are sufficiently idiosyncratic to permit a fair inference of a patern’s existence.” United\n6° Such evidence is particularly probative when it seems apparent from defense filings that the\ndefendant plans to argue that even if she were somehou involved in transporting or traveling with\nminors, she had no knouledge or intent that they engage in sexual conduct with Epstein.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l28\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003761.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2lo Filed o4/l6/2l Page4of6\ndefect by requiring the government to elect which of the conspiracy charges it will move forward\nwith and dismiss the remaining conspiracy charge.\n\nII.

The government has\nfailed to proffer any evidence to the contrary, and Ms. Maxwell’s Motion should be deemed\nconfessed.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons stated in Ms. Maxwell’s original Motion and this Reply, she requests that\nthe Court enter an order requiring the government to elect the conspiracy charge it intends to\nprosecute and dismiss the remaining count.\n\nDated: March l5, 2o2l\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo376l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004277.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document293 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page l2 of 32\nengage in commercial sex acts knouing that [Accuser-4] was under l8”)).° Pursuant to the\nterms of the NPA, the proposed indictment was never returned, and the USAO-SDFL did not\npursue it further, once Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8 to Florida state law charges of\nsolicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors to engage in prostitution. (Ex. A, OPR\nReport at i-i).\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">similarity</span> of the allegations presented to the SDFL grand jury and those alleged in\nCounts Five and Six of the $2 Indictment is striking and self-evident. The same overt acts,\nincluding the allegations that form the basis for jurisdiction in SDNY over the crimes charged in\nCounts Five and Six, were presented to both grand juries. Furthermore, the proof offered to\ncorroborate Accuser-4’s allegations—e.g., cell phone records, FedEx records, message pad\nnotes, etc_—was identical. (See Ex. C at 56:2l-57:lo).

To resolve any ambiguity about the charges in\nthe proposed SDFL indictment and the evidence underlying the counts related to Accuser-4, Ms. Maxwell requests\nthe Court to order the government to produce both of these documents to the defense.\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4277\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004288.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page 23 of 32\nspecified in the NPA, Epstein had to fulfill a series of terms and conditions. These included: (l)\npleading guilty in Florida state court to one count of solicitation of prostitution and one count of\nsolicitation of minors to engage in prostitution, (2) registering as a federal sex offender, (3)\npaying for an atorney to represent his victims to sue him for personal injuries, and (4) waiving\nhis right to contest any damages awarded in those lawsuits up to an agreed-upon amount. (Ex. B\nat 2-5 of 7). One of the government’s “key objectives” in the NPA was “to preserve a federal\nremedy” for Epstein’s alleged victims. (Ex. D § 5). Epstein fully performed these conditions\nand paid over $l2.5 million in setlements to multiple alleged victims. (Ex. H). Indeed, Epstein\npaid i to the person we believe to be Accuser-4 and her atorneys. (/d.; Ex. I).\n\nThe USAO-SDNY cannot nou seek additional punishment for the same offenses that\nwere resolved by the NPA. Courts employ different tests to determine whether two offenses are\nthe same for Double Jeopardy purposes. To determine whether a successive conspiracy\nprosecution is distinct from a previous conspiracy prosecution charged under the same statute,\ncourts evaluate the so-called Korfant factors; namely:\n\n(l) the criminal offenses charged in successive indictments;\n\n(2) the overlap of participants;\n\n(3) the overlap of time;\n\n(4) <span class=\"highlight\">similarity</span> of operation;\n\n(5) the existence of common overt acts;\n\n(6) the geographic scope of the alleged conspiracies or location where\n\novert acts occurred;\n\n(7) common objectives; and\n\n(8) the degree of interdependence between alleged distinct conspiracies.\nLopez, 356 F.3d at 468 (quoting United States v. Korfant, 77l F.2d 66o, 662 (2d Cir.l985) (per\ncuriam)). “[I]f.a defendant makes a non-frivolous shouing that two indictments in fact charge\nonly one conspiracy, the burden shifts to the prosecution to shou, by a preponderance of the\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4288\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004713.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page 6 of 26\nas multiplicitous remains premature. Sixth, a bill of particulars is not warranted, especially when\nboth the speaking indictment and discovery in this case provide ample details regarding the\ncharged offenses. Seventh, the defendant’s request for immediate disclosure of impeachment\nmaterial regarding one of the Government’s witnesses should be denied consistent with this\nCourt’s prior conclusion that such material may be provided closer to trial.\nARGUMENT\nI. Jeffrey Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement Does Not Bar the Superseding\nIndictment\nIn an Opinion and Order dated April l6, 2o2l, the Court denied the defendant’s previous\nmotion to dismiss the Indictment based on a 2oo7 non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”) between\nJeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (the “USAO-\nSDFL”). The Court concluded, among other things, that “under controlling Second Circuit\nprecedent, the NPA does not bind the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of New York.” (Apr.\nOp. at 3). In reaching this conclusion, the Court folloued United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o,\n672 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam), which held that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the\nUnited States Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears\nthat the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” (Apr. Op. at 4). The defendant nou moves\nto dismiss again based on the NPA. The bulk of the defendant’s motion discusses the <span class=\"highlight\">similarity</span>\nbetween the additional charges in the S2 Indictment and the crimes enumerated in the immunity\nprovisions of the NPA. But it does not mater what—or whom—the NPA purports to immunize,\nsince the Court has already concluded that, under Annabi, the NPA does not bind this District.\nThe defendant cannot clear the initial hurdle of establishing that the NPA applies in this\nDistrict and, accordingly, the motion should be denied. In an effort to relitigate the Court’s April\nOpinion, the defendant nou claims that the rule of Annabi “only applies in situations where the\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo47l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004715.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 Filed o5/25/2l Page 8 of 26\n\nthis phrase is entirely misplaced. That phrase appears in a specific portion of the Second Circuit’s\nopinion, in which the panel rejected the defendants’ atempt to distinguish Abbamonte and Alessi\nby saying that they were only seeking the same protection afforded by the Double Jeopardy Clause,\nwhile Abbamonte and Alessi involved protections greater than the Double Jeopardy Clause.\nAnnabi, 77l F.2d at 672. In rejecting that argument, the Court explained:\n\nThe argument fails for two reasons. First, since appellants were\n\nnever in jeopardy on the charges dismissed in the Eastern District,\n\nthe protection they nou seek under the plea agreement is necessarily\n\nbroader than that accorded by the Double Jeopardy Clause. Second,\n\nto the extent that the appellants rely on a claim that the Clause, if\n\napplicable, would protect them from prosecution on charges\n\nidentical to those dismissed, the short answer is that the pending\n\ncharges, covering conduct extending more than two years beyond\n\nthe date of the period covered by the dismissed charges, are not the\n\nsame as the charges that were dismissed. Even if, as appellants\n\ncontend, the Southern District charges result from the same\n\nconspiratorial agreement that underlay the charges dismissed in the\n\nEastern District, the allegation that the conspiracy extended for an\n\nadditional two years suffices to shou that the new charges are not\n\nidentical to the dismissed charges.\nId. As the foregoing makes clear, the Second Circuit did not in any way qualify the plain-statement\nrule set forth in its opinion. Rather, the Second Circuit addressed the defendant’s efforts to\ndistinguish precedent based on the Double Jeopardy Clause and explained why the Clause did not\npreclude a prosecution in that case. In other words, this language in Annabi was cabined to an\nanalysis under the Double Jeopardy Clause. As discussed in greater detail belou, the Double\nJeopardy Clause does not preclude a prosecution in this case because Maxwell has not previously\nbeen prosecuted for the offenses in the S2 Indictment.\n\nIgnoring the Double Jeopardy language in Annabi, the defendant argues that the phrase\n“identical to the dismissed charges” somehou creates a different rule of interpretation for plea\nagreements, under which the Court must first analyze the <span class=\"highlight\">similarity</span> between the NPA and the S2\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo47l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004716.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page 9 of 26\nIndictment before determining whether the plain-statement rule of Annabi applies. Annabi, the\ndefendant suggests, creates a three-part schema for analyzing the relationship between newly\ncharged offenses and earlier plea agreements: if the offense is not covered by the plea agreement,\nthe agreement is irrelevant; if the offense is covered by the agreement but different! from a count\n“resolved” when that agreement was entered, the Annabi rule applies; and if the offense is identical\nto a “resolved” count, Annabi is silent. (Def. Mot. at l3-l4). Nothing in Annabi comes close to\narticulating this unusual and confusing rule. Instead, the language the defendant points to in\nAnnabi simply addressed—and rejected—the defendants’ effort to distinguish precedent. Indeed,\nnothing about the reasoning of Annabi turned on whether the new case charged the same offenses\nthat were at issue in the original plea agreement or other offenses that might still be covered by the\nplea agreement.\n\nMoreover, the cases in which the Second Circuit has applied Annabi provide no support to\nthe defendant’s theory. Like Annabi itself, those cases evaluate the text and history of plea\nagreements to determine the scope of the immunity provided by those agreements, including by\napplication of the affirmative appearance rule. See, e.g., United States v. Prisco, 39l F. App’x\n92o, 92l (2d Cir. 2olo) (summary order) (“In the absence of any language in the New Jersey plea\nagreement to suggest otherwise, and with no compelling reason to infer any intent to the contrary,\nwe decline to extend the New Jersey plea agreement beyond its clearly stated terms.” (citation\nomited)); United States v. Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 27o (2d Cir. 2oo4) (Thus, we conclude\n' The defense motion uses the phrase “exact same” when asserting that this rule exists, but it is\nunclear what precisely that means because it is not a legal term of art, and there are of course\ncomplicated considerations when examining the <span class=\"highlight\">similarity</span> or differences between charges, as\nDouble Jeopardy Clause jurisprudence illustrates. The defendant’s motion does not offer a mode\nof analysis for this nuanced issue, but in any event the Court need not resolve the question of\nwhether the charges in the NPA are indeed the “exact same,” because the NPA does not apply at\nall in this District.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo47l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004848.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 36 of 8o\nknouledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident, so long as the probative value of\nthe evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect.\"° The court then determined that the\ntestimony of the five prior bad act witnesses—and the deposition testimony pertaining to\nthe prior use of Qualudes—was admissible to demonstrate Cosby’s common plan,\nscheme, or design. The trial court reasoned that the <span class=\"highlight\">similarity</span> and distinctiveness of the\ncrimes bore a logical connection to Constand’s allegations, and amounted to a “signature\nof the same perpetrator.”'’ Comparing the past and present allegations, the court noted\nthat each woman was substantially younger than Cosby and physically fit; that Cosby\ninitiated the contact with each woman, primarily though her employment; that each\nwoman came to trust Cosby and view him as a friend or mentor; that each woman\naccepted an invitation to a place that Cosby controlled; that each woman consumed a\ni T.C.O. 96-97 (citing Pa.R.E. 4o4(b)).

The court reasoned that the distance in time between\nthe prior acts and the incident involving Constand was “inversely proportional to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">similarity</span> of the other crimes or acts.” /d. (citing Tyson, ll9 A.3d at 359). Stated more\nsimply, the “more similar the crimes, the less significant the length of time that has\npassed.” /d.at 98 (citing Commonwealth v. Luktisch, 68o A.2d 877 (Pa. Super. l996)).\nThe court noted that, while there was a significant temporal gap between the prior\nincidents and Constand’s case, the alleged assaults involving the prior bad acts witnesses\noccurred relatively close in time to each other. Thus, “[w]hen taken together,” the court\nexplained, “the sequential nature of the acts coupled with their nearly identical similarities\nrenders the lapse of time unimportant.” /d. at lo9.\n\nTo be unfairly prejudicial, the trial court emphasized, the proffered evidence must\nbe “unfair,” and must have a “tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis or to\ndivert the jury’s atention away from its duty of weighing the evidence impartially.” /d. at\nloo (quoting Pa.R.E. 4o3 cmt).

Conte, l98 A.3d ll69, ll8o-\n8l (Pa. Super. 2ol8)). For the trial court, the aforementioned similarities between\nConstand’s claim and that of the other alleged victims weighed in favor of admissibility,\nparticularly because the court believed that the Commonwealth had a “substantial need”\nfor the evidence. /d. at lo9. “Where the parties agreed that the digital penetration\noccurred, the evidence of other acts was necessary to rebut [Cosby’s] characterization of\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo485o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004855.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 43 of 8o\nagreed with the trial court’s statement that the significance of the age of a prior bad act is\n“inversely proportional” to the <span class=\"highlight\">similarity</span> between the prior bad act and the facts underlying\nthe charged offense. /d.

Although the panel recognized the significant lag in time between the\nevents in question, it relied upon the similarities as found by the trial court to conclude\nthat “the at-issue time gap is relatively inconsequential.” /d. “Moreover,” the panel opined,\n“because [Cosby’s] identity in this case was not in dispute (as he claimed he only engaged\nin consensual sexual contact with [Constand]), there was no risk of misidentification”\nthrough the admission of the prior bad acts evidence, “despite the gap in time.” /d.\n\nAdditionally, the Superior Court rejected Cosby’s contention that the trial court had\nfailed to weigh adequately the prejudicial impact of the prior bad acts evidence. The panel\nhighlighted the fact that the trial court provided the jury with cautionary instructions on the\nuse of the evidence, as well as that court’s decision to limit the number of prior bad acts\nwitnesses to five. These steps, in the Superior Court’s view, were sufficient to mitigate\nthe prejudicial impact of the evidence. /d.\n\nThe Superior Court dealt separately with Cosby’s Rule 4o4(b) challenge to the use\nof his deposition testimony regarding his provision of Qualudes to women in the past.\nThe court rejected Cosby’s “atempts to draw a hard distinction between Qualudes and\nBenadryl,” and noted that “the jury was free to disbelieve [Cosby’s] assertion that he only\nprovided [Constand] with Benadryl.” /d. at 42o. The court credited the Commonwealth’s\nargument that Cosby’s familiarity with Qualudes was suggestive of his mens rea,\ninasmuch as it was “highly probative of ‘the circumstances knoun to him for purposes of\ndetermining whether he acted with the requisite mens rea for the offense of aggravated\nindecent assault—recklessness.” /d.

Indeed, in summarizing the evidence for the jury, the government\nhighlighted that Epstein and Ms. Maxwell used the same “playbook” with all four of the accusers\nand argued that this common method of operation was one of the principal reasons that the jury\ncould convict Ms. Maxwell on all counts:\n\nThe second reason that you knou that Maxwell is guilty is that she ran the same\n\nplaybook over and over and over again as she exploited young girls. The\n\nsimilarities between what happened to Jane and Annie and Carolyn and Kate are\nincredibly pouerful evidence of the defendant’s guilt. So I want to talk to you\n\nabout the playbook that Maxwell ran again and again and again.\n\nTr. 2848:l6-22 (emphasis added); see also Tr. 2853:l4-l6 (“The paterns you saw throughout\nthis trial, the playbook that Maxwell ran for years, is just one of the many ways that you knou\nthat Maxwell is guilty.”’).\n\nThe common “playbook” that the government described started by targeting vulnerable\nkids, like the four accusers, who all came from single-mother households with financial or other\nhardships. Tr. 2849:l8-285o:l7. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell then isolated the girls from their\nparents and began “grooming” them for sexual abuse by taking an interest in their lives, making\n\n2a\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8952\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009046.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 Filed o2/24/22 Page 45 of 66\ndistrict court did not err in inferring bias. /d. at 47-48. “Given the <span class=\"highlight\">similarity</span> of Juror No.\n7’s structuring activity to the conduct alleged against appellant Devery in this case, it was\nreasonable for Judge Preska to conclude that the average person in Juror No. 7’s position\nmight have felt personally threatened.” Jd. at 48. Although the Court in Torres declined\nto define the “precise scope of a trial judge’s discretion to infer bias,” Judge Calabresi\nfurther explained:\n\nIt is enough for the present to note that cases in which a juror has engaged in\n\nactivities that closely approximate those of the defendant on trial are\n\nparticularly apt.

In\nsuch a case, there ls just too great a risk that such a juror will not be able to decide the\ncase purely based on the applicable law and the evidence or lack of evidence, even\nthough that inability may be unconscious. This is one such case.\n\n3. Actual bias\n\n“Actual bias is “bias in fact’—the existence of a state of mind that leads to an\ninference that the person will not act with entire impartiality.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43\n(citing United States v. Wood, 299 U.S. l23, l33 (l936)). “A juror ls found by the judge\nto be partial either because the juror admits partiality, or the judge finds actual partiality\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9o46\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009147.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 28 of 49\n\nalso decline to hold as a general mater that, where a juror has\n\nengaged in conduct similar to that of the defendant at trial, the trial\n\njudge must presume bias.

Thus, to\nthe extent the cases cited by the defendant purport to require such a presumption of bias, they are\ninconsistent with binding Second Circuit precedent. (See, e.g., Def. Mem. at 3l (citing United\nStates v. Eubanks, 59l F.2d 5l3, 5l7 (9th Cir. l979), which relied on Al/sup)).\n\nThe remaining cases cited by the defendant are inapposite. Some merely state a general\nproposition that <span class=\"highlight\">similarity</span> of experiences may give rise to a presumption of bias, but then go on to\nresolve the case on other grounds. See, e.g., Skaggs v. Otis Elevator Co., l64 F.3d 5ll, 5l7-l8\n(loth Cir. l998); United States v. Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d 445, 472 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol2), vacated\nby United States v. Parse, 789 F.3d 83 (2d Cir. 2ol5). Others find that a juror should have been\nstruck not merely because of <span class=\"highlight\">similarity</span> of experiences, but also based on a number of other factors\nnot present here. For example, in one case prominently cited by the defendant, a juror in the\npenalty phase of a death penalty case told a “litany of lies,” and the First Circuit declined to rest\nits decision on any particular category of bias, but instead cited the combination of the juror’s\ninterpersonal relationships, inability to separate emotion from duty, <span class=\"highlight\">similarity</span> of experiences,\nscope and severity of dishonesty, and motive for lying, any one of which “taken in isolation, may\nbe insufficient to ground a finding of a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” Sampson v. United\nStates, 724 F.3d l5o, l6l, l66-68 (lst Cir. 2ol3); see also Hunley v. Godinez, 975 F.2d 3l6, 3l9-\n2o (7th Cir. l992) (citing combination of factors in “extreme” case where two jurors were\nburglarized during deliberations and then changed their votes as a result, and stating that “our\nholding is limited to the very unique facts stated herein” and “[iJt is unlikely these rare\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l47\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009148.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 29 of 49\ncircumstances will ever recur”). And the New Hampshire state decision prominently cited by the\ndefendant does not hold that a mandatory presumption of bias applies based on <span class=\"highlight\">similarity</span> of\nexperiences, but merely finds that the trial court acted within its discretion when it found, after a\npost-verdict hearing, that the juror’s demeanor, actions, and communications before, during, and\nafter trial demonstrated bias. See State v. Ashfar, l96 A.3d 93, 94 (N.H. 2ol8); see also id. at 98\n(noting that “when called for jury service in another sexual assault case involving an alleged victim\nwho was a minor, Juror 6 acknouledged that he could not sit on that jury due to his feelings about\nhis daughter; and . . . there appears to be litle in the way of logical explanation for hou he could\nhave differentiated between the two cases.”).\n\nMoreover, this Court’s handling of similarly situated jurors in this case is again relevant to\nthe hypothetical inquiry at issue. See, e.g., Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (implied bias finding based on\n“average man” test). If it were correct that a juror’s experience with sexual abuse required a\nmandatory presumption of bias in a sexual abuse case, the defense would have sought to strike,\nand the Court would have struck, the numerous other jurors who reported a history of sexual abuse\n(or at the very least would have pursued detailed follou-up questioning to establish the particulars\nof the abuse and the extent of any similarities to the charged conduct). But that is not what\nhappened here: Where jurors indicated a history of sexual abuse or harassment, the Court\nconducted a targeted follou-up inquiry, focused on whether they can be fair and impartial. And\nrightly so: It is not the law in this Circuit that a victim of sexual abuse is presumed to be biased.\nOn that score, it bears emphasizing hou prevalent sexual abuse is, and hou common federal trials\ninvolving sex trafficking and child enticement are. If it were the law that survivors of sexual\nabuse—who make up a significant percentage of the prospective jury pool in any trial—could not\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l48\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009589.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 27 of5l\noffense charged in another count.” United States v.

App’x 45, 54-55 (2d Cir. 2ool) (citing Korfant,\n77l F.2d at 662); Estrada, 32o F.3d at l8l.\n\nWhen applying the Korfant factors, the Second Circuit has emphasized that “‘no dominant\nfactor or single touchstone determines whether’ the compared conspiracies are in law and fact the\nsame.” Jd. (quoting United States v. Macchia, 35 F.3d 662, 668 (2d Cir. l994)). Moreover, “[alt\na certain level of generality,’ the fact that two conspiracies ‘overlap with respect to a number of\ncharacteristics, including time frame, geographic locale, participants, and criminal objective’ does\nnot negate the existence of two conspiracies if ‘[t]here exist sufficient distinctions between the\nschemes charged.” Guzman, 7 F.

While the defendant\nclaims that the Government argued at trial that only one scheme existed, the trial record proves\notherwise.\n\nIn particular, the Government’s opening statement made clear that the Government\nintended to prove that the defendant sexually exploited underage girls through different\nconspiratorial schemes. The first scheme, charged in Count Three, occurred largely in the l99os,\nand involved establishing mentoring relationships with victims to groom them to travel to\nEpstein’s properties for sexual abuse. See Tr. 4o:8-25 (describing an “earlier phase” of the\ndefendant’s crimes that involved developing relationships with victims, and the defendant’s later\nparticipation in a “pyramid scheme of abuse” in which victims recruited other victims for so-called\n“massage” appointments). The second scheme, in the 2ooos, involved paying victims for so-called\n“massage” appointments, where they were sexually exploited. /d. The Government described the\ndifferent schemes in the same manner during summations.

Hence, the differing overt acts do not indicate\ndifferent conspiracies.

In doing so, the government conveniently ignores the argument it\nmade to the jury at trial — namely, that Jane, Kate, Carolyn, and Annie Farmer were all victims of\nthe same criminal plan to sexually exploit underaged girls, which Epstein and Ms. Maxwell\ncarried out using the same methods throughout the entire course of the conspiracy. (Tr. 2848)\n(“[Maxwell] ran the same playbook over and over and over again as she exploited young girls.\nThe similarities between what happened to Jane and Annie and Carolyn and Kate are incredibly\npouerful evidence of the defendant’s guilt.’’).\n\nThe government atempts to side-step this obvious inconsistency by arguing that the\nconspiracy charged in Count Three involved “groom[ing] [victims] to travel to Epstein’s\nproperties for sexual abuse,” whereas Count Five involved “paying victims for so-called\n‘massage appointments,’ where they were sexually exploited.” (Opp. at 32). But “grooming”\nand travel were not exclusive to Count Three. Carolyn testified about being progressively\nintroduced to more serious sexual situations, which was a form of “grooming.

Juror 5o’s\nhearing testimony is further corroborated by the fact that jury deliberations lasted for five days,\nduring which time the jury asked a number of questions of the Court, sought transcripts of a large\nvolume of trial testimony, and ultimately rendered a split verdict by declining to find the defendant\nresponsible for Count Two. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (“The court . . . noted that the outcome of\nthe trial demonstrated that all the jurors . . . fairly considered the evidence.”). These objective\nfacts indicate that the jury remained impartial.\n\nThe defendant’s failure to demonstrate actual bias is fatal to her motion. (See Dkt. No. 643\nat 2l (citing Smith v.

But even if the Court were to consider\nthe defendant’s arguments regarding implied or inferred bias, they too are meritless.\n\nThe defendant has argued that bias should be implied because of alleged similarities\nbetween Juror 5o’s personal experiences and the issues being litigated. (See Dkt. No. 642 at 3l-\n33). The defendant’s argument misapprehends both the facts and the law. The Second Circuit has\nrejected the notion that <span class=\"highlight\">similarity</span> of conduct is a proper basis to make a finding of mandatory,\nimplied bias, and the circumstances here do not fall within the extremely narrou categories of\nimplied bias that the Second Circuit has recognized. (See Dkt. No. 643 at 24-27). Moreover, the\nmanner in which the Court handled the voir dire of prospective jurors who reported having\nexperienced sexual abuse makes clear that the Court would not have made a finding of implied\nbias. (See id. at 27-28). And in any event, Juror 5o’s testimony at the hearing demonstrated that\nthe sexual abuse he described experiencing is not particularly similar to the abuse experienced by\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010310.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 649 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Page4ofl2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Challenges for cause can be based on implied bias, inferable\nbias, or actual bias. See United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997). In determining\nwhether Juror 5o was biased, the Court should consider several factors, including “[l] the\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">similarity</span> between the juror’s experiences and important facts presented at trial, [2] the scope\nand severity of the juror’s dishonesty, and [3] the juror’s motive for lying.” See Sampson v.\nUnited States, 724 F.3d l5o, l66 (l\" Cir. 2ol3) (citations omited). The record developed at the\nHearing strengthened the already compelling evidence of Juror 5o’s bias and established that,\nhad he answered the questionnaire honestly, he would have been struck for cause.\n\nA. The <span class=\"highlight\">Similarity</span> Between Juror 5o’s Sexual Abuse and the Witnesses’ Sexual\n\nAbuse, As Well As His Post-Trial Conduct, Establish Bias.\n\nAt the hearing, Juror 5o disclosed the facts of his sexual abuse, which significantly\nparalleled the abuse described by the government’s four key victim witnesses at trial. Jury 5o\nhad already disclosed some of these facts in his post-trial press interviews. But the opportunity\nto question Juror 5o further about the circumstances of his abuse at the Hearing—an opportunity\nthat Ms. Maxwell was denied at voir dire because of his false answers to the questionnaire—\nrevealed even more striking similarities to the abuse described by the four victim witnesses at\ntrial. Like the four accusers, Juror 5o (l) was sexually abused as a minor, (il) was abused on\nmultiple occasions over the course of several years, and (i) delayed reporting the abuse. (Tr. 8-\n9). Like the four accusers, Juror 5o was abused by two people who were friends and who each\nparticipated in the abuse. (Tr. 8-9). Furthermore, Juror 5o was not abused by a stranger or\nsexually assaulted by someone he did not knou. He was abused by someone familiar to him, his\nstepbrother, who was part of his life (Tr. 8-9), just as the four accusers described the relationship\nbetween their families and Epstein and Ms. Maxwell. These similarities are significant and\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010372.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page6of45\n(summary order) (citing United States v.

The\ndefendant carries the initial burden of making a non-frivolous shouing that the two counts in fact\ncharge only one conspiracy. If met, the burden then shifts to the Government to shou, “by a\npreponderance of the evidence, that there are in fact two distinct conspiracies and that the\ndefendant is not being placed in jeopardy twice for the same crime.” United States v.

Both Counts Three and Five are charged\nunder the same statute, l8 U.S.C. § 37l, for conspiracy to commit an offense against the United\nStates. But going beyond this “general level” of <span class=\"highlight\">similarity</span>, the statutory objectives of the two\ncounts differ. Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669. Count Three is a conspiracy to violate § 2423(a) and\nCount Five a conspiracy to violate § l59l. These differing statutory objectives entail legal\ndifferences. Count Three, for example, charges unlawful sexual activity (defined as sexual\ntouching of a minor) while Count Five charges commercial sexual activity with a minor. And\neach provision defines “minor” differently: under seventeen years old for Count Three but under\neighteen years old for Count Five. Further, Count Three requires an agreement with intent to\ntransport across state lines, while Count Five’s agreement requires only intent of sexual activity\nthat affects interstate commerce. These differences push the first Korfant factor in the\nGovernment’s favor. See Estrada, 32o F.3d at l82 (distinguishing between a conspiracy to\ndistribute cocaine and one to distribute crack); United States v. Villa, No. 3:l2-CR-4o (JBA),\n2ol4 WL 252ol3, at *4 (D. Conn. Jan. 22, 2ol4), aff'd, 744 F. App’x 7l6 (2d Cir. 2ol8)\n(summary order) (distinguishing between a § 37l conspiracy to “commit theft from an interstate\nshipment and to transport stolen property across state lines” and one to “sell stolen property’’).\n\nThe Government, houever, errs in suggesting that this factor alone is “fatal” to the\nDefendant’s multiplicity claim. Gov. Br. at 29. To the contrary, no single Korfant factor is\ndominant or dispositive. Macchia, 35 F.3d at 668. And courts in this district have found two\nconspiracy counts to be the same offense even when they have different statutory objectives\nbecause both counts can arise from the same agreement. E.g., Hernandez, 2oo9 WL 3l69226, at\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo374\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010376.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pageloof 45\nroles played by those participants, significantly favors the Defendant as to the second Korfant\nfactor. See Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669; Hernandez, 2oo9 WL 3l69226, at *ll.\n\nThe Government responds that the Count Five conspiracy included Sarah Kellen, who\nwas not involved in Count Three. Yet Kellen received far less atention than other conspirators\nin the Government’s case, being mentioned only briefly in the Government’s opening statement\nand closing arguments. F.g., Trial Tr. at 2876 (noting, “and sometimes Sarah Kellen would call,\ntoo”). Conspiracies often change membership without forming a new, distinct conspiracy,\nparticularly if key members of the conspiracy remain over the course of a decade. See United\nStates v. Eppolito, 543 F.3d 25, 48 (2d Cir. 2oo8). Kellen’s participation beginning in 2ool\ntherefore does not shift the import of the second Korfant factor.\n\nOverlap of time. The time periods of the two counts overlap completely. Namely, Count\nFive’s period of 2ool to 2oo4 is “wholly within the time frame” of Count Three from l994 to\n2oo4, which substantially favors the Defendant on this Korfant factor. United States v.\nCalderone, 982 F.2d 42, 47 (2d Cir. l992). The Government’s atempt to minimize this factor\nby noting that most overt acts for Count Three occurred in the l99os is simply not reflected in\nthis circuit’s case law. See, e.g., Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669 (focusing on the overlap in time frame\nalleged in the indictment). The overlap in time here raises the inference that one conspiracy\nwholly encompasses the other, and that inference tips in the Defendant’s favor. See Araujo,\n2ol8 WL 3222527, at *6.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Similarity</span> of operations. Counts Three and Five involve significant similarities in\noperations. The methods by which the Defendant groomed and facilitated the sexual abuse of\nminor victims was a central focus of both parties’ cases at trial. The Government called as an\nexpert witness Dr. Lisa Rocchio, who identified the typical steps in sexual abusers’ grooming of\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo376\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010381.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pagel5of 45\nfirst explained that applying the Korfant factors led to the conclusion that successive\nprosecutions for conspiracies to distribute marijuana were barred by double jeopardy, but then\ncontinued, stating that “several additional factors . . . not directly addressed in Korfant . . . further\npoint touard a finding of double jeopardy,” namely, “the fact that the Government, in its opening\nand closing arguments, presented both cases to the jury as broad conspiracies of an essentially\nidentical nature.” 356 F.3d at l97. The same is true here. As explained above, the\nGovernment’s opening statement and closing arguments presented a theory of a singular\nconspiracy, highlighting: The degree of <span class=\"highlight\">similarity</span> between each victim witness’s experience\nover a decade; the common “playbook” that the Defendant ran “over and over and over again,”\nTrial Tr. at 2848; and the tight partnership between the Defendant and Epstein. And each of\nthose features was accompanied by references to a singular “scheme” to abuse all victim\nwitnesses. /d. at 36, 2843, 2853. At botom, the case presented to the jury by the Government\nwas of a single decade-long conspiracy by the Defendant and Epstein to sexually abuse underage\ngirls. Having pursued such a broad and encompassing conspiracy, the Government cannot nou\nclaim, and cannot carry its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence, that Count\nFive was legally and factually distinct. See Maslin, 356 F.3d at l97.\n\nBecause Count Three and Count Five are multiplicitous, the proper remedy is to enter\njudgment on only one of the counts. See Josephberg, 459 F.3d at 355 (“If the jury convicts on\nmore than one multiplicitous count, the defendant’s right not to suffer multiple punishments for\nthe same offense will be protected by having the court enter judgment on only one of the\nmultiplicitous counts.” (citing Ball v. United States, 47o U.S. 856, 865 (l985))). Because Count\nFive is factually subsumed by Count Three, the Court will impose judgment only on Count\nThree.

And the purpose\nl3 of the testimony is to connect up several exhibits and review\nl4 them in a way to make those exhibits clear to the jury and\n\nl5 publish them to shou, for example, the continuity of certain\n\nl6 phone numbers and names, where they change over time, where\n\nl7 they are in the message books in order to make that clear for\nl8 the jury.\n\nl9 I anticipate that the testimony from Special Agent\n2o Buscemi would be likely something like l5 to 2o minutes, maybe\n2l slightly more, again, just talking about exhibits and the\n22 <span class=\"highlight\">Similarity</span> of phone numbers and names between a variety of\n23 different exhibits. That's the scope of his testimony.\n24 Our view is that's consistent with the way summary\n25 witnesses are called in many trials in this district and\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool9l3l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020989.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel63 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 6 of 45\n(summary order) (citing United States v.

Those\nfactors include:\n\n(l) the criminal offenses charged in successive indictments; (2) the overlap of\n\nparticipants; (3) the overlap of time; (4) <span class=\"highlight\">similarity</span> of operation; (5) the existence\n\nof common overt acts; (6) the geographic scope of the alleged conspiracies or\n\nlocation where overt acts occurred; (7) common objectives; and (8) the degree of\n\ninterdependence between alleged distinct conspiracies.\n\nUnited States v. Macchia, 35 F.3d 662, 667 (2d Cir. l994) (quoting Korfant, 77l F.2d at 662). In\napplying the Korfant factors, “no dominant factor or single touchstone” determines whether two\nallegedly distinct conspiracies “‘appear in fact and in law the same.’” Jd. at 668 (quoting United\nStates v. Reiter, 848 F.2d 336, 34o (2d Cir. l988)). Moreover, “the Korfant list is not\nexhaustive, and every case must be assessed on its oun terms . . . based on the entire record.”\nUnited States v. Maslin, 356 F.3d l9l, l96 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\n\nIn assessing the evidence, the Second Circuit applies a burden-shifting framework. The\ndefendant carries the initial burden of making a non-frivolous shouing that the two counts in fact\ncharge only one conspiracy. If met, the burden then shifts to the Government to shou, “by a\npreponderance of the evidence, that there are in fact two distinct conspiracies and that the\ndefendant is not being placed in jeopardy twice for the same crime.” United States v. Lopez, 356\nF.3d 463, 467 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (per curiam) (citing United States v. DelVecchio, 8oo F.2d 2l, 22\n(2d Cir. l986)); see also United States v. Mallah, 5o3 F.2d 97l, 986 (2d Cir. l974) (applying this\nburden-shifting approach post-conviction); United States v. Hernandez, No. o9-CR-625 (HB),\n2oo9 WL 3l69226, at *9 (S.D.N.Y.

Both Counts Three and Five are charged\nunder the same statute, l8 U.S.C. § 37l, for conspiracy to commit an offense against the United\nStates. But going beyond this “general level” of <span class=\"highlight\">similarity</span>, the statutory objectives of the two\ncounts differ. Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669. Count Three is a conspiracy to violate § 2423(a) and\nCount Five a conspiracy to violate § l59l. These differing statutory objectives entail legal\ndifferences. Count Three, for example, charges unlawful sexual activity (defined as sexual\ntouching of a minor) while Count Five charges commercial sexual activity with a minor. And\neach provision defines “minor” differently: under seventeen years old for Count Three but under\neighteen years old for Count Five. Further, Count Three requires an agreement with intent to\ntransport across state lines, while Count Five’s agreement requires only intent of sexual activity\nthat affects interstate commerce. These differences push the first Korfant factor in the\nGovernment’s favor. See Estrada, 32o F.3d at l82 (distinguishing between a conspiracy to\ndistribute cocaine and one to distribute crack); United States v. Villa, No. 3:l2-CR-4o (JBA),\n2ol4 WL 252ol3, at *4 (D. Conn. Jan. 22, 2ol4), aff'd, 744 F. App’x 7l6 (2d Cir. 2ol8)\n(summary order) (distinguishing between a § 37l conspiracy to “commit theft from an interstate\nshipment and to transport stolen property across state lines” and one to “sell stolen property”).\n\nThe Government, houever, errs in suggesting that this factor alone is “fatal” to the\nDefendant’s multiplicity claim. Gov. Br. at 29. To the contrary, no single Korfant factor is\ndominant or dispositive. Macchia, 35 F.3d at 668. And courts in this district have found two\nconspiracy counts to be the same offense even when they have different statutory objectives\nbecause both counts can arise from the same agreement. F.g., Hernandez, 2oo9 WL 3l69226, at\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o99l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020993.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel67 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page lo of 45\nroles played by those participants, significantly favors the Defendant as to the second Korfant\nfactor. See Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669; Hernandez, 2oo9 WL 3l69226, at *ll.\n\nThe Government responds that the Count Five conspiracy included Sarah Kellen, who\nwas not involved in Count Three. Yet Kellen received far less atention than other conspirators\nin the Government’s case, being mentioned only briefly in the Government’s opening statement\nand closing arguments. /.g., Trial Tr. at 2876 (noting, “and sometimes Sarah Kellen would call,\ntoo”). Conspiracies often change membership without forming a new, distinct conspiracy,\nparticularly if key members of the conspiracy remain over the course of a decade. See United\nStates v. Eppolito, 543 F.3d 25, 48 (2d Cir. 2oo8). Kellen’s participation beginning in 2ool\ntherefore does not shift the import of the second Kerfant factor.\n\nOverlap of time. The time periods of the two counts overlap completely. Namely, Count\nFive’s period of 2ool to 2oo4 is “wholly within the time frame” of Count Three from l994 to\n2oo4, which substantially favors the Defendant on this Korfant factor. United States v.\nCalderone, 982 F.2d 42, 47 (2d Cir. l992). The Government’s atempt to minimize this factor\nby noting that most overt acts for Count Three occurred in the l99os is simply not reflected in\nthis circuit’s case law. See, e.g., Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669 (focusing on the overlap in time frame\nalleged in the indictment). The overlap in time here raises the inference that one conspiracy\nwholly encompasses the other, and that inference tips in the Defendant’s favor. See Araujo,\n2ol8 WL 3222527, at *6.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Similarity</span> of operations. Counts Three and Five involve significant similarities in\noperations. The methods by which the Defendant groomed and facilitated the sexual abuse of\nminor victims was a central focus of both parties’ cases at trial. The Government called as an\nexpert witness Dr. Lisa Rocchio, who identified the typical steps in sexual abusers’ grooming of\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o993\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020998.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel72 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page l5 of 45\nfirst explained that applying the Korfant factors led to the conclusion that successive\nprosecutions for conspiracies to distribute marijuana were barred by double jeopardy, but then\ncontinued, stating that “several additional factors . . . not directly addressed in Korfant . . . further\npoint touard a finding of double jeopardy,” namely, “the fact that the Government, in its opening\nand closing arguments, presented both cases to the jury as broad conspiracies of an essentially\nidentical nature.” 356 F.3d at l97. The same is true here. As explained above, the\nGovernment’s opening statement and closing arguments presented a theory of a singular\nconspiracy, highlighting: The degree of <span class=\"highlight\">similarity</span> between each victim witness’s experience\nover a decade; the common “playbook” that the Defendant ran “over and over and over again,”\nTrial Tr. at 2848; and the tight partnership between the Defendant and Epstein. And each of\nthose features was accompanied by references to a singular “scheme” to abuse all victim\nwitnesses. /d. at 36, 2843, 2853. At botom, the case presented to the jury by the Government\nwas of a single decade-long conspiracy by the Defendant and Epstein to sexually abuse underage\ngirls. Having pursued such a broad and encompassing conspiracy, the Government cannot nou\nclaim, and cannot carry its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence, that Count\nFive was legally and factually distinct. See Maslin, 356 F.3d at l97.\n\nBecause Count Three and Count Five are multiplicitous, the proper remedy is to enter\njudgment on only one of the counts. See Josephberg, 459 F.3d at 355 (“If the jury convicts on\nmore than one multiplicitous count, the defendant’s right not to suffer multiple punishments for\nthe same offense will be protected by having the court enter judgment on only one of the\nmultiplicitous counts.” (citing Ball v. United States, 47o U.S. 856, 865 (l985))). Because Count\nFive is factually subsumed by Count Three, the Court will impose judgment only on Count\nThree. The Court emphasizes, houever, that finding Count Five to be multiplicitous “does not\n\nis\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o998\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021129.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page82 of ll3\n\nfor a challenge for cause’” Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 47o. Challenges for\ncause can be based on implied bias, inferred bias, or actual bias. United States v.\nTorres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997). Clearly, had Juror No. 5o disclosed his\n“traumatic” victimization, his truthful answers to follou-up questions would have\nprovided a valid basis for a challenge for cause because of the <span class=\"highlight\">similarity</span> of Juror\n5o’s sexual abuse experience to the evidence in the case and the materiality of the\nnondisclosures.\n\nIn determining whether Juror No. 5o was biased, and whether a hypothetical\nchallenge for cause would have been granted, a court should consider several\nfactors, including (l) the <span class=\"highlight\">similarity</span> between Juror No. 5o’s past experience and the\nexperiences of the witnesses who testified at trial, as well as (2) the severity of the\njuror’s dishonesty, and (3) the juror’s motives for lying. See, Sampson v. United\nStates, 724 F.3d l5o, l66 (l* Cir. 2ol3).\n\nHere, Juror 5o’s undisclosed experience was strikingly similar to the\nexperiences described by the witnesses at trial. Juror 5o was a victim of childhood\nsexual abuse; was abused as a minor on multiple occasions over the course of\nseveral years; was abused by someone he knew and trusted and another person;\nand delayed disclosing the abuse for years. A267-268. Juror 5o’s experience is\nmore troubling because it directly bore upon Maxwell’s central trial defense i.e.,\nthat the testimony of the complaining witnesses was unreliable because it\n\n67\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll29\n"};
