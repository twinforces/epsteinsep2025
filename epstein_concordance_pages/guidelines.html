Late July 2oo6: The State Indicts Epstein, and the USAO Moves\nForward with a Federal Investigation\n\nSeveral days after Villafafia spoke with Acosta and Sloman, on July l9, 2oo6, Assistant\nState Atorney Belohlavek presented the case to the state grand jury.> Krischer told OPR that\n“the whole thing” was put before the grand jury. According to a statement made at the time by the\nState Atorney’s Office spokesman, the grand jury was presented with a list of charges from highest\nto louest, without a recommendation by the prosecutor, and deliberated with the prosecutor out of\nthe room.”* The state grand jury returned an indictment charging Epstein with one count of felony\nsolicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7, a felony under state law because\nit alleged three or more instances of solicitation.” The indictment did not identify the person or\npersons solicited and made no mention of the fact that Epstein had solicited minors.”® On July 23,\n2oo6, Epstein self-surrendered to be arrested on the indictment, but was not detained, and the\ncharges were made public.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she decided to move forward with the federal investigation at that\npoint because she believed the State Atorney’s Office would permit Epstein to enter a plea to a\nreduced misdemeanor charge and that once he entered a guilty plea, the Department’s Petite policy\nmight preclude a federal prosecution.?’ Villafafia told OPR that at the time, she “definitely\nbelieved that we were going to proceed to [a federal] indictment, assuming that ...we had\nsufficient evidence.”\neS Villafafia and the FBI obtained and examined records of the state grand jury proceeding, and Lourie reviewed\nthem. Because the grand jury records have not been ordered released publicly, OPR does not discuss their substance\nin this Report.\nat Larry Keller, “Police say lawyer tried to discredit teenage girls,” Palm Beach Post, July 29, 2oo6, citing\nstatement by State Atorney’s Office spokesman Michael Edmondson.\n28 Indictment in State v. Epstein, 2oo6CF9454AXX (July l9, 2oo6), atached as Exhibit l to this Report.\n26 In pertinent part, the state indictment read, “[B]etween the lst day of August [2oo4] and October 3l, 2oo5,\n[Epstein] did solicit, induce, entice, or procure another to commit prostitution lewdness, or assignation, . . . on three\nor more occasions.” The l5-month time frame and lack of detail regarding the place or manner of the offense made\nit impossible to identify from the charging document which victim or victims served as the basis for the charge in the\nstate indictment. Belohlavek explained to OPR that the charge did not list specific victims so that she could go forward\nat trial with whichever victim or victims might be available and willing to testify at that time.\n27 The Petite policy is a set of <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> used by federal prosecutors when considering whether to pursue federal\ncharges for defendants previously prosecuted for state or local offenses. The Constitution does not prohibit the federal\ngovernment from prosecuting defendants who have been charged, acquited, or convicted on state charges based on\nthe same criminal conduct. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing principle that the prohibition\nagainst double jeopardy does not apply to prosecutions brought by different sovereigns. See, e.g., Gamble v. United\nStates, 587 U.S. ___, l39 S. Ct. l96o, l966-67 (2ol9) (and cases cited therein); Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S.\nl87, l95 (l959) (and cases cited therein); and United States v. Lanza, 26o U.S. 377, 382 (l922). Nonetheless, to\nbeter promote the efficient use of criminal justice resources, the Department developed policies in l959 and l96o to\nguide federal prosecutors in the use of their charging discretion. See Chapter Two, Part Two, Section IT.A.2, for a\nmore detailed discussion of the Petite policy.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3222", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003224.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 48 of 348\nalso informed Sloman and Lourie that the FBI was re-interviewing victims who had given taped\nstatements to the PBPD, to ensure their stories “have not changed,” and that “[a]ny discrepancies\nwill be noted and considered.” She conceded that “[g]eting them to tell their stories in front of a\njury at trial may be much harder,” but expressed confidence that the two key victims “will stay the\ncourse.” She acknouledged that the case “needs to be rock solid.”\n\nThe case agent told OPR that in this initial stage of the investigation, the FBI “partnered\nup very well” with the USAO. She recalled that there was litle higher-level management oversight\neither from the FBI or the USAO, and “we were alloued to do what we needed to do to get our\njob done.” This included continuing to identify, locate, and interview victims and Epstein\nemployees, and obtaining records relating to Epstein’s travel, communications, and financial\ntransactions. The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”\n\n5. October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.*+ Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\n22 Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\n3 Chapter One, Section III.B of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to . . . change anything.”\n\nam Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nU.S. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3224", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003231.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 55 of 348\n\nLourie folloued up his email to Villafafia with one to Menchel, in which Lourie reiterated\nthe potential benefits of a pre-indictment plea, explaining that he and Villafafia believed “the best\nthing to do is charge Epstein by complaint, assuming we decide to charge him. ... The\n[sentencing] <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> will be in the 2o year range, so we would need to plead him to one or two\nconspiracies to cap him and there is no telling if a judge would go for that once we indict.””\nMenchel responded that he and Acosta would read the prosecution memorandum and “[w]e can\ndiscuss after that.”\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia sent Lourie an email, which Lourie forwarded to Menchel,\nexplaining that a “conservative calculation” of Epstein’s potential sentencing exposure under the\nU.S. Sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> would be l68 to 2lo months, and that in her view, the facts warranted\nan upward departure from that range. Villafafia told OPR that although Lourie proposed some\nchanges to the draft indictment, at that point no one had told her that the evidence was insufficient\nto support the proposed charges or that the office did not want to go forward with the case.\n\nIn an email to Acosta and Menchel on May ll, 2oo7, Lourie recommended charging\nEpstein by complaint and seeking a pre-indictment plea:\n\nMy current thoughts are that we should charge him. Not sure that I\nagree with the charging strategy as it is nou, but at this point I think\nwe only need to get on the same page as to whether the statutes cover\nthe conduct and whether the conduct is the type we should charge.\nI think the answer to both is yes, although there is some risk on some\nof the statutes as this is uncharted territory to some degree. We can\ndecide later what the [charging document] should look like precisely\nand which victims should be charged.\n\nI also think if we choose to go forward, we should start with a\ncomplaint, arrest him, detain him . . . and then try to see if he wants\na pre-indictment resolution. That would give us more control [over]\na plea than if we indict him and need the court’s approval to dismiss\ncounts. We will need to cap him with conspiracy counts to make a\nplea atractive and the court could give us a hard time with that if we\ntry to dismiss indicted counts.\n\nAlthough her supervisors were communicating among themselves about the case, Villafafia\nwas unaware of those discussions and was frustrated that she was not receiving more feedback.\nShe continued preparing to charge Epstein. Two weeks after submiting the prosecution\nmemorandum, on May l4, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Lourie and Menchel by email that Epstein\nwas flying to New Jersey from the Virgin Islands, and she asked whether she could file charges\nthe next day. Menchel responded that “[y]ou will not have approval to go forward tomorrou,”\nand explained that Acosta “has your [prosecution] memo,” but was at an out-of-toun conference,\nadding, “This is obviously a very significant case and [A]lex wants to take his time making sure\n43 Lourie told OPR that he was referring to one or two counts of conspiracy under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, the general\n“omnibus” federal conspiracy statute that carries a maximum sentence of five years.\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR- oooo323l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003241.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 65 of 348\nI do think it’s important to look back on this, and try to be in the\nshoes of the thought process in 2oo6 and ’o7 when trafficking\nprosecutions were fairly new, when . . . more so than today, some\njurors may have looked at this as prostitution, and . . . [a] judge’s\ntolerance for victim shaming may have . . . caused more hesitation\non the part of victims... .©\nFinally, Acosta told OPR that a state-based resolution offered more flexibility in fashioning\na sentence, because he believed prosecutors would have difficulty persuading a federal district\ncourt in the Southern District of Florida to approve a federal plea for a stipulated binding sentence\nthat differed from the otherwise applicable federal sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> range. **\nIn summarizing his thinking at the time, Acosta told OPR,\nThe way the mater came to the office was, the state wasn’t doing\nenough. It didn’t provide for prison time. It didn’t provide for\nregistration, and then you had the restitution issue. There were legal\nissues ... . There were witness issues. And... we could go to trial\n...and we may or may not prevail. Alternatively, we could look at\na pre-indictment resolution, and at various points, the office went\nback and forth between a federal pre-indictment resolution, and a\nstate pre-indictment resolution.\nAcosta told OPR that, in the end, “there was a preference for deferring to the state” because, in\npart, the facts of the Epstein case at the time appeared to constitute solicitation or prostitution\nrather than trafficking, and a federal prosecution would be “uncharted territory.” Acosta explained\nthat he did not view it as problematic to defer resolution of the case to the state, although as the\nEpstein case played out, the federal role became “more intrusive” than he had anticipated, because\nthe defense tried to get the state to “circumvent and undermine” the outcome.\nAtorney’s Office could have proceeded against Epstein by way of an information, but decided to go into the grand\njury because the State Atorney’s Office “didn’t like the case” and wanted “political cover” for declining the case or\nproceeding on a lesser charge.\n3 Menchel told OPR, houever, that the federal judges in West Palm Beach were highly regarded and were\ngenerally viewed as “pro-prosecution.”\not Acosta said that “dismissing a number of counts and then doing a [R]ule ll is not something that [South\nFlorida federal district] judges tend to do.” Other subjects also told OPR that the federal judges in the Southern District\nof Florida were generally considered averse to pleas that bound them on sentencing, commonly referred to as “Rule\nll(c) pleas.”\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) allous the parties to agree on a specific sentence as part of\na plea agreement. The court is required to impose that sentence if the court accepts the plea agreement; if the court\ndoes not accept the agreed upon plea and sentence, the agreement is void. Villafafia told OPR that Rule ll(c) pleas\nwere “uncommon” in the Southern District of Florida, as the “judges do not like to be told . . . what sentence to\nimpose.” Menchel similarly told OPR that the USAO viewed federal judges in the Southern District of Florida as\naverse to Rule ll(c) pleas, although Menchel had negotiated such pleas. Villafafia told OPR that she had never offered\na Rule ll(c) plea in any of her cases and had no experience with such pleas.\n39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo324l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003242.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 66 of 348\nMenchel could not recall who initially suggested a state plea, but noted to OPR that his\n\noun “emails . .. make clear that this course of action was ultimately decided by Alex Acosta.” He\nreferenced, among others, his May l4, 2oo7 email to Villafafia informing her that Acosta was\ndeciding hou he wanted to handle the case. Menchel surmised that a state resolution accomplished\ntwo things that Acosta viewed as important: first, it resolved any Petite policy concerns, and\nsecond, it afforded more flexibility in sentencing than a federal plea would have alloued. Menchel\ntold OPR that the state plea proposal did not reflect any minimization of Epstein’s conduct and\nthat any state plea would have been to an offense that required sexual offender registration. He\ntold OPR, “I don’t think anybody sat around and said, you knou, it’s not that big a deal. That was\nnot the reaction that I think anybody had from the federal side of this case.” Rather, Menchel said,\n“The concern was if we charge him [as proposed], there’s going to be a trial.”\n\nDe July 2oo7: Villafaia and Menchel Disagree about the Proposed State\n\nResolution\nVillafafia told OPR that she was angry when she received Menchel’s July email explaining\n\nthat he had proposed to Sanchez resolving the federal investigation through a state plea. In\nVillafafia’s view, the proposed state resolution “didn’t make any sense” and “did not correspond”\nto Department policy requiring that a plea offer reflect “the most serious readily provable\noffense.”® In her view, a plea to a state charge “obviously” would not satisfy this policy. Villafafia\nalso told OPR that in her view, the USAM required the USAO to confer with the investigative\nagency about plea negotiations, and Villafafia did not believe the FBI would be in favor of a state\nplea. Villafafia also believed the CVRA required atorneys for the government to confer with\nvictims before making a plea offer, but the victims had not been consulted about this proposal.\nVillafafia told OPR she had met with some of the victims during the course of the investigation\nwho had negative impressions of the State Atorney’s Office, and she believed that “sending them\nback to the State Atorney’s Office was not something” those victims would support.\n& This policy was set forth in a September 22, 2oo3 memorandum from then Atorney General John Ashcroft\nregarding “Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and Sentencing”\n(knoun as the “Ashcroft Memo”), which provided, in pertinent part:\n\n[I]n all federal criminal cases, federal prosecutors must charge and pursue the\n\nmost serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts\n\nof the case, except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, United States\n\nAtorney, or designated supervisory atorney in the limited circumstances\n\ndescribed belou. The most serious offense or offenses are those that generate the\n\nmost substantial sentence under the Sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, unless a mandatory\n\nminimum sentence or count requiring a consecutive sentence would generate a\n\nlonger sentence. A charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor has a good\n\nfaith doubt, for legal or evidentiary reasons, as to the Government’s ability readily\n\nto prove a charge at trial. Thus, charges should not be filed simply to exert\n\nleverage to induce a plea. Once filed, the most serious readily provable charges\n\nmay not be dismissed except to the extent permited [elsewhere in this\n\nMemorandum].\nSee also Chapter Two, Part Two, Section II.B.l.\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3242", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003251.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 75 of 348\nVillafafia, Menchel left the meeting after almost no discussion, leaving Villafafia “shocked and\nstunned.”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall the July 26, 2oo7 meeting. Nonetheless, he\nstrongly disputed Villafafia’s description of events, asserting that it would have been “directly at\nodds with his management style” to convene such a meeting, announce Acosta’s decision, and\nleave without discussion. Acosta told OPR that he had “decided and endorsed this resolution at\nsome point,” but he did not recall being aware that Menchel was going to announce the decision\nat the July 26 meeting; in addition, although Acosta did not recall the circumstances of Menchel’s\nrelaying of that decision, he said it “would have been consistent with” his decision for Menchel to\ndo so. Neither Sloman nor Lourie recalled the meeting. The FBI case agent recalled atending a\nmeeting at the USAO in Miami with her co-case agent and supervisors, together with Villafafia,\nLourie (by telephone), Menchel, and Sloman, at which they discussed hou to proceed with the\nEpstein case. According to the case agent, at this meeting the FBI insisted that Epstein be\nregistered for life as a sexual offender, and the co-case agent advocated for waiting until the court\nhad ruled on the USAO’s ability to obtain Epstein’s computer equipment.\n\nRegardless of exactly hou Acosta’s decision regarding the two-year term was\ncommunicated to Villafafia and the FBI agents, and regardless of who initially proposed the\nspecific term, the record shous that Acosta ultimately made the decision to offer Epstein a\nresolution that included a two-year term of imprisonment, as he acknouledged.”\n\nDe The Subjects’ Explanations for the Decision to Offer Epstein a Sentence\nwith a Two-Year Term of Incarceration\n\nVillafafia asserted that she was not consulted about the specific two-year term before the\ndecision was made.” Villafafia told OPR that she had worked hard to develop a strong case, and\nnone of her supervisors had identified to her any specific problem with the case that, in her view,\nexplained the decision to extend an offer for a two-year sentence. Villafafia also told OPR that\nMenchel provided no explanation for this decision during the July 26, 2oo7 meeting, and Villafafia\ndid not ask for an explanation because she accepted his statement that it was Acosta’s decision.\nVillafafia described the proposal as “random,” and told OPR, “[W]e’re all [sentencing] <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>\npeople, so 24 months just makes no sense in the context of the <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>. There’s no way to get\nto 24 months with this set of offenses.”*°\nl8 OPR notes that Villafafia did not appear hesitant to send emails to her supervisors seting forth her views and\nobjections, and there is no reference before this meeting in any of her emails indicating that a decision had been made\nto offer a two-year term of incarceration. Therefore, given that a meeting had been arranged involving Menchel and\nVillafafia, and possibly most of the other primary USAO and FBI participants, it seems logical that Acosta made a\ndecision to resolve the case with a two-year state plea not long before the meeting.\n\n2 OPR found no evidence in the documentary record indicating that Villafafia had knouledge of Acosta’s\ndecision or the two-year term before the July 26, 2oo7 meeting at which she said she learned of it.\n8o From the time the U.S. Sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> went into effect in l987, they have been the mechanism for\ncalculating federal criminal sentences.

He opined to OPR that the decision was likely based on an\nassessment by Menchel and Lourie of the litigation risks presented by the case.*! Sloman added\nthat he did not knou hou a two-year sentence might have related to specific charges or to either\nstate or federal sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>. Lourie likewise told OPR he did not recall hou the two-year\nterm was decided upon, or by whom, but he speculated that it may have been presented by the\ndefense as the most Epstein would accept, and that the decision would have been reached by\nAcosta follouing “extended consideration, research, and discussion,” among Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. *”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall discussing a two-year plea deal with Acosta or\nwho reached the decision that two years was an appropriate sentence. Menchel also told OPR,\nhouever, that he recalled believing that if the USAO had filed the contemplated federal charges,\nEpstein would have felt he had “‘nothing to lose” and “undoubtedly” would have chosen to take\nthe case to trial. Menchel recalled believing there was a real risk that the USAO might lose at trial,\nand in so doing, might cause more trauma to the victims, particularly those who were reluctant to\ntestify. Menchel told OPR that he did not believe that anyone at the time looked at two years “as\na fair result in terms of the conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not\nif we took this case to trial, would we risk losing everything,” and “if we . . . felt we could have\ngoten more time, we would have, without having to press it to the trial.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “I had decided and endorsed” the two-year resolution “at some\npoint,” and that it resulted from “back and forth” discussion “over the course of some days or a\nweek or two.” As noted earlier in this Report, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in this case merely\nas a “backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he explained to OPR was “a polite way of saying[,\n‘Jencouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]”*? Acosta said that he understood two years’\nimprisonment to have represented the sentence Epstein faced under one of the original charges the\nPBPD was considering at the outset of the state investigation.** Acosta also told OPR that he\n\nthe atorney for the government has a continuing obligation to assist the court in\n\nits determination of the sentence to be imposed. The prosecutor must be familiar\n\nwith the <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> generally and with the specific guideline provisions applicable\n\nto his or her case. In discharging these duties, the atorney for the government\n\nshould . . . endeavor to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information\n\nupon which the sentencing decisions will be based.\na In Sloman’s view, Menchel and Lourie were “two of the finest trial lawyers” in the USAO.\nae Lourie noted that Sloman and Menchel were “two extraordinarily experienced people in [Acosta’s] front\noffice who had tried . . . gobs and gobs of cases.”\n83 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney asserted that OPR’s use of Acosta’s quote, “a litle\nbit more,” “unfairly minimized” Acosta’s and the USAO’s efforts to achieve justice in this case. Acosta’s atorney\nalso asserted that the phrase was “clearly soft-spoken understatement,” that the terms obtained were “substantially\nmore onerous than the state’s alternative resolution,” and that Acosta was “clearly declining the invitation to take the\nState to task and soft-pedaling an obvious distinction.”\n\n84 OPR examined this assertion and was unable to verify that the proposed two-year term of imprisonment\ncorresponded with the charges that the PBPD considered at the outset of the state investigation or with the charge in\n5o\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3252", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003253.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 77 of 348\nunderstood that the PBPD would not have asked the FBI to investigate Epstein if the state had\npursued the appropriate charges. In other words, in Acosta’s view, “[T]his was, rightly or wrongly,\nan analysis that distinguished between what is necessary to prevent manifest injustice, versus what\nis the appropriate federal outcome to that.” Acosta told OPR that he believed he had discussed his\nconcerms about the case with Lourie, Sloman, or Menchel, although he could not recall any specific\nconversation with them.\n\nE. Villafaia Drafts a “Term Sheet” Listing the Requirements of a Potential\n\nAgreement with the Defense\n\nA meeting with defense counsel was scheduled for Tuesday, July 3l, 2oo7. Villafafia told\nOPR that between July 26 and July 3o, 2oo7, she had “some sort of discussion” with her\nsupervisors that resulted in her creation of a “term sheet” identifying the proposed terms for\nresolving the federal investigation through state charges. Sometime during that period, Villafafia\nleft a voicemail message for Menchel. During their OPR interviews, neither Villafafia nor\nMenchel could recall what Villafafia said in that message. On July 3o, 2oo7, Menchel emailed\nVillafafia:\n\nI received your voicemail this morning. I don’t see any reason to\nchange our approach. I think telling them that unless the state\nresolves this in a way that appropriately vindicates our interests and\nthe interests of the victims, we will seek [federal charges] conveys\nthat we are serious. While Lilly [Sanchez] has represented in the\npast that this would likely not happen, I never conveyed it in quite\nthese terms before. In any event, this is the course of action that the\nUS Atorney feels comfortable taking at this juncture.\n\nThe follouing day, July 3l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed a one-page “Terms of Epstein\nNon-Prosecution Agreement” to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie. Villafafia told OPR she had never\nbefore seen or heard of a non-prosecution agreement and that it was a concept “completely foreign”\nto her.®° Villafafia told OPR that the idea of styling the two-year state plea agreement with Epstein\nthe state indictment. OPR considered various potential state charges involving various numbers of victims and found\nno obvious reasonable state sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> calculation that would have resulted in a two-year sentence.\n\n8 Deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements were standard, though infrequently used, vehicles for\nresolving certain federal criminal cases against corporate entities. A 2oo8 Departmental memorandum explained:\n\nThe terms “deferred prosecution agreement” and “non-prosecution agreement”\n\nhave often been used loosely by prosecutors, defense counsel, courts and\n\ncommentators. As the terms are used in these Principles [of Federal Prosecution\n\nof Business Organizations], a deferred prosecution agreement is typically\n\npredicated upon the filing of a formal charging document by the government, and\n\nthe agreement is filed with the appropriate court. In the non-prosecution\n\nagreement context, formal charges are not filed and the agreement is maintained\n\nby the parties rather than being filed with a court. Clear and consistent use of\n\nthese terms will enable the Department to more effectively identify and share best\n\npractices and to track the use of such agreements. These Principles do not apply\n\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3253", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003256.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8o of 348\nthe period of imprisonment, because the USAO failed to hold firm to its proposal of “at least two\nyears in prison.” The USAO did, houever, consistently reject defense proposals to change other\nterms, particularly the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.\n\nA.

A few days after the meeting,\nVillafafia emailed Menchel, stating that she had “figured out a way to do a federal plea with a 2-l/2\nyear cap.”\n\nAlthough Acosta had authorized a plea to state charges, emails and other correspondence\nshou that during the negotiations, the parties also considered structuring a plea around federal\ney Villafafia was the only witness with whom OPR spoke who had a substantive memory of this meeting.\n\n88 According to the Florida Department of Corrections fact sheet for defendants subjected to community control,\n\nThe Community Control supervision program was created as a diversion to\n\nincarceration or imprisonment; therefore it is an intensive supervision program\n\nwhere you are confined to your home unless you are working, atending school,\n\nperforming public service hours, participating in treatment or another special\n\nactivity that has been approved in advance by your officer.

While on Community Control\n\nsupervision (also knoun as “house arrest”) you will not be alloued to leave your\n\nhome to visit family or friends, go out to dinner or to the movies, go on vacation,\n\nor many of the other activities you are used to being able to do... , but it does\n\nallou you to continue to work to support yourself and your family or atend school\n\nin lieu of being incarcerated and away from loved ones.\nFlorida Dept. of Corrections, Succeeding on Community Control at l, htp://www.de.state. fl.us/cc/ceforms/\nSucceeding-on-Community-Control.pdf.\n8 Villafafia told OPR that she was concerned about a state resolution because the defense team “had a lot of\nexperience with the state system. We did not.” Villafafia anticipated there would be ways to “manipulate” a state\nsentence and the USAO would be “giving up all control,” and she told OPR that she discussed this concern with\nLourie, although she could not recall when that discussion occurred.\n\n54\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3256", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003267.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 9l of 348\n\nVillafafia told OPR that during the meeting, the group discussed the draft NPA, but she did\nnot think they gave a copy to Krischer and Belohlavek. Neither Krischer nor Belohlavek expressed\nconcer about proceeding as the USAO was proposing. According to Villafafia, Belohlavek\nexplained that a plea to the three state counts identified in the draft NPA would affect the state’s\nsentencing <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>, and that it would be beter for the <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> calculation if Epstein pled\nguilty to just one of the three counts. Villafafia recalled that when Belohlavek confirmed that\nEpstein would be required to register as a sexual offender if he pled to any one of the three charges,\nLourie, speaking for the USAO, agreed to allou Epstein to enter his plea to just one state charge\nin addition to the pending state indictment, and the defense atorneys selected the charge of\nprocurement of minors to engage in prostitution.!°° Lourie, houever, disputed Villafafia’s\nrecollection that he made the final decision, stating that it was “illogical” to conclude that he had\nthe authority to change the terms of agreement unilaterally. !°’\n\nDuring the meeting, defense counsel raised concerns about Epstein serving time in state\nprison. Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie, the other supervisor, and she made clear during the\nmeeting that they expected Epstein to be incarcerated 24 hours a day, seven days a week, during\nthe entirety of his sentence, and they did not “particularly care” whether it was in a state or local\nfacility. Belohlavek explained to OPR that in order for Epstein to serve his time in a county\nfacility, rather than state prison, his sentence on each charge could be no more than l2 months, so\nthat, for example, consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months—totaling l8 months—could be\nserved in the county jail. Villafafia told OPR:\n\nOur thing was incarceration 24 hours a day. So during this meeting,\n\nI remember [the defense] talking about .. .a one year count folloued\n\nby a six-month count . . . that [Epstein] could serve them back to\n\nback but at the county jail, rather than having to go to a state facility.\n\nBut then I said, “But if you do that, it’s still going to have to be round\n\nthe clock incarceration.” And Barry Krischer said yes. And [he]\n\nsaid that to avoid [Epstein being extorted while incarcerated], he\n\nwould be kept in solitary confinement.\nVillafafia did not recall whether she and Lourie agreed to an l8-month sentence during that\nmeeting, but she told OPR that in her view, allouing Epstein to serve his sentence in the county\njail was not a “concession” because he would be incarcerated regardless.\n\nNeither Lourie nor the other USAO supervisor present could recall any substantive details\nof the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and Krischer and Belohlavek told OPR they did not remember\nthe meeting at all. Krischer did, houever, recall that he was “not offended at all” when he learned\nof the proposed federal resolution, requiring Epstein to plead to both the pending state indictment\nand an additional charge requiring sexual offender registration, explaining to OPR that Epstein\n“was going to plead guilty to my indictment, we were going to add an additional charge, he was\nlo6 Later, the defense would claim that they had mistakenly understood that the selected charge would not\ninvolve sexual offender registration.\n\nlo7 As noted belou, a contemporaneous email indicates that shortly after the meeting, Lourie and Villafafia spoke\nwith Acosta and Sloman, who concurred with the agreement.\n65\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3267", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003274.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 98 of 348\nwe go that route, would you intend to make the deferred [sic] prosecution agreement public?”\nVillafafia replied that while a federal plea agreement would be part of the court file and publicly\naccessible, the NPA “would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would remain part\nof our case file. It probably would be subject to a FOIA [Freedom of Information Act] request,\nbut it is not something that we would distribute without compulsory process.”!'® Villafafia told\nOPR that she believed Epstein did not want the NPA to be made public because he “did not want\npeople to believe him to have commited a variety of crimes.” As she explained to OPR, Villafafia\nbelieved the NPA did not need to be disclosed in its entirety, but she anticipated notifying the\nvictims about the NPA provisions relating to their ability to recover damages.\nE. The Parties Appear to Reach Agreement on a Plea to Federal Charges\nNegotiations continued the next day, Tuesday, September l8, 2oo7. Responding to\n\nVillafafia’s revised draft of the NPA, Lefkouitz suggested that Epstein plead to one federal charge\nwith a l2-month sentence, folloued by one year of supervised release with a requirement for home\ndetention and two years of state probation, with the first six months of the state sentence to be\nserved under community control. Villafafia replied, “I knou that the U.S. Atorney will not go\nbelou l8 months of prison/jail time (and I would strongly oppose the suggestion).” Shortly\nthereafter, Villafafia emailed Acosta, Lourie, and the incoming West Palm Beach manager:\n\nHi all — I think that we may be near the end of our negotiations with\n\nMr. Epstein, and not because we have reached a resolution. As I\n\nmentioned yesterday, I spent about l2 hours over the weekend\n\ndrafting Informations, changing plea agreements, and writing\n\nfactual proffers. I was supposed to receive a draft agreement from\n\nthem yesterday, which never arrived. At that time, they were\n\nleaning touards pleading only to state charges and doing all of the\n\ntime in state custody.\n\nLate last night I talked to Jay Lefkouitz who asked about Epstein\n\npleading to two twelve-month federal charges with half of his jail\n\ntime being spent in home confinement pursuant to the <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>. I\n\ntold him that I had no objection to that approach but, in the interest\n\nof full disclosure, I did not believe that Mr. Epstein would be eligible\n\nbecause he will not be in Zone A or B.'!’ This morning Jay\n\nLefkouitz called and said that I was correct but, if we could get\n\nMr. Epstein doun to l4 months, then he thought he would be\n\neligible.\n\nMy response: have him plead to two separate Informations.

I would like to send Jay Lefkouitz an e-mail stating that\nif we do not have a signed agreement by tomorrou at 5:oo,\nnegotiations will end.

When [Epstein] gets out, he has to plead to state\noffenses, including against minor, registrable, and then take one year house arrest/community\nconfinement.” By reply email, Villafafia asked Lourie to call her, but there is no record of whether\nthey spoke.\n\nF. Defense Counsel Offers New Proposals Substantially Changing the Terms of\n\nthe Federal Plea Agreement, which the USAO Rejects\n\nApproximately an hour after Lourie’s email reporting the deal he had reached with\nLefkouitz, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a revised draft plea agreement. Despite the agreement Lourie\nbelieved he and Lefkouitz had reached that morning, Lefkouitz’s proposal would have resulted\nin a l6-month federal sentence folloued by 8 months of supervised release served in the form of\nhome detention. Lefkouitz also inserted a statement in his proposal explicitly prohibiting the\nUSAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration authorities to institute immigration\nproceedings against two of Epstein’s female assistants.\n\nVillafafia circulated the defense’s proposed plea agreement to Lourie and two other\nsupervisors, and expressed frustration that the new defense version incorporated terms that were\n“completely different from what Jay just told Andy they would agree to.” Villafafia also pointed\nout that the defense “wants us to recommend an improper calculation” of the sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>\nll8 The manager told OPR that he probably meant this as a joke because in his view the continued back-and-\nforth communications with defense counsel “was ridiculous,” and the only way to “get this deal done” might be to\nhave a direct conversation with Epstein.\n\n73\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3275", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003324.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l48 of 348\n\nSome offenses, even though in violation of Federal law, are of\n\nparticularly strong interest to the authorities of the state or local\n\njurisdiction in which they occur, either because of the nature of the\n\noffense, the identity of the offender or victim, the fact that the\n\ninvestigation was conducted primarily by state or local\n\ninvestigators, or some other circumstance.

USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°” The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist.

The Ashcroft Memo cautioned\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“particularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy.

U.S. Atorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.?”\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. II,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.’’).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7* A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o5 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v.

See USAM §§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.7°? Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o8 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\nCircumstances,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional circumstances with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an Assistant Atorney General, United States Atorney, or designated\n\nsupervisory atorney. This exception recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system. For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office. Houever, such case-by-case\n\nexceptions should be rare; otherwise the goals of fairness and equity will be\n\njeopardized.\nAshcroft Memo at § I.B.6.

In\nAcosta’s view, “the federal responsibility” in this unique situation was merely to serve as a “‘back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”**’ Acosta told OPR\nthat he understood the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s atention if the State\nAtorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration. Acosta therefore decided that\nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein\nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.\n\nAcosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated references to a\n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used\nin the Petite policy to define the circumstances in which the federal government may proceed with\na criminal case after a completed state prosecution. Nothing in the Petite policy, houever, requires\nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a completed state\nprosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense. The goal of the Petite\npolicy is to prevent multiple prosecutions for the same offense, not to compel the federal\ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials\ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions\nregarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case. Acosta told OPR that “there are any\nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state\ncharges are substantially less and different, and .. . the federal government . . . stands aside and\nlets the state proceed.” The fact that the federal government can allou the state to proceed with a\nprosecution, houever, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in\na mater in which a distinct and important federal interest exists. Indeed, the State Atorney told\nOPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators,\ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”\n\nEpstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>.**\nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily\nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a litle bit more” does not approach\nthat standard. In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent\nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,”\nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from\nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to\nad Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n248 Villafafia estimated that the applicable sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> range was l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment.\nl72\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3374", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003382.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o6 of 348\n“I’m reconstructing memories of... l2 years ago. I can speculate that at some point, the mater\ncame up, and I or someone else said . .. what would the original charges have likely brought? And\nsomeone said this amount.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall who initially proposed this\nmethod, but he believed that it likely did not result from a single specific discussion but rather\nfrom conversations over a course of time. Acosta could not recall specifically with whom he had\nthese discussions, other than that it would have been Lourie, Menchel, or Sloman. Villafafia was\nnot asked for her views on a two-year sentence, and she had no input into the decision before it\nwas made. Villafafia told OPR that she examined the state statutes and could not validate that a\nstate charge would have resulted in a 24-month sentence. OPR also examined applicable state\nstatutes and the Florida sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>, but could not confirm that Epstein was, in fact,\nfacing a potential two-year sentence under charges contemplated by the PBPD.\n\nOn the other hand, during his OPR interview, Lourie “guess[ed]” that “somehou the\ndefense conveyed . . . we’re going to trial if it’s more than two years.” Menchel similarly told\nOPR that he did not knou hou the two year sentence was derived, but “obviously it was a number\nthat the office felt was palatable enough that [Epstein] would take” it. Sloman told OPR that he\nhad no idea hou the two-year sentence proposal was reached.\n\nThe contemporaneous documentary record, houever, provides no indication that Epstein’s\nteam proposed a two-year sentence of incarceration or initially suggested, before the USAO made\nits offer, that Epstein would accept a two-year term of incarceration. As late as July 25, 2oo7—\nonly days before the USAO provided the term sheet to defense counsel—Epstein’s counsel\nsubmited a leter to the USAO arguing that the federal government should not prosecute Epstein\nat all. Furthermore, after the initial “term sheet” was presented and negotiations for the NPA\nprogressed, Epstein’s team continued to strongly press for less or no time in jail.\n\nThe USAO had other charging and sentencing options available to it. The most obvious\nalternative to the two-year sentence proposal was to offer Epstein a plea to a federal offense that\ncarried a harsher sentence. If federally charged, Epstein was facing a substantial sentence under\nthe federal sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>, l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment. Houever, it is unlikely that\nhe would have agreed to a plea that required a <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> sentence, even one at the louer end of\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues had been concerned that Epstein\nwould opt to go to trial if charged and presented with the option of pleading to a <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>\nsentence, and as previously discussed, there were both evidentiary and legal risks atendant upon\na trial in this case. If federally charged, Epstein’s sentencing exposure could have been managed\nby offering him a plea under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c) for a stipulated sentence,\nwhich requires judicial approval. Acosta rejected this idea, houever, apparently because of a\nperception that the federal district courts in the Southern District of Florida did not view Rule ll(c)\npleas favorably and might refuse to accept such a plea and thus limit the USAO’s options.\n\nAnother alternative was to offer Epstein a plea to conspiracy, a federal charge that carried\na maximum five-year sentence. Shortly after Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum\nto her supervisors, Lourie recommended to Acosta charging Epstein by criminal complaint and\noffering a plea to conspiracy “to make a plea atractive.” Similarly, before learning that Menchel\nhad already discussed a state-based resolution with Epstein’s counsel, Villafafia had considered\noffering Epstein a plea to one count of conspiracy and a substantive charge, to be served\nconcurrently with any sentence he might receive separately as a result of the state’s outstanding\n\nl8o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3382", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003383.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o7 of 348\nindictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution\nthat ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would\nbe sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\ntraditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis. In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3383", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003392.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l6 of 348\n. . . 7D: oe\nTimeline of Key Events for Crime Victims’ Rights Act Analysis\nAug lo — FBI Dec 7 — Sloman tells Iuly 7 —Jane Doe files an Additional Key Dates\nbegins interviewing Villafafia to “hold the emergency petition against\nvictims leter” re notification fo the United States asserting Dec l7. 2olo DOJ\nvictims about state court violations of the CVRA mi\nnee Office of Legal\nplea hearing Mar l9 — Villafafia Counsel issues opinion\n; ug sie re : = - secures pro-bono July 9— USAO begins regarding CVRA\na oe , ee ee Dec l9 — Acosta sends atorneys for victims sending leters to victims\nF on i eg - oo ae i leter to Epstein’s counsel Mar-Mavy — FBI concerning resolution of Oct 2oll — DOJ revises\nsaid satan nee ad Ea advising USAO will defer Rise AM federal investigation AG <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>\nof the girls MEO One ee : interviews victims\nnotification of state plea\nto state officials May 29, 2ol5-CVRA\nAug 28 — FBI begins _ amended to include two\nsending VNS leters it\nee ses Jan lo— FBI new rights\n— ds VNS let :\nee ae Feb 2l, 2ol9 — Dist.

For\nexample, the first right grants a victim protection from “the accused,” not a suspect. Additionally,\nthe second, third, and fourth rights refer to “victim notification, and access to, public proceedings\ninvolving release, plea, sentencing or parole—none of which commence prior to the filing of a\ncomplaint.”\n\nB. 2oo5 Atorney General <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> for Victim and Witness Assistance\n\nIn May 2oo5, the Department updated its Atorney General <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> for Victim and\nWitness Assistance (2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>) to include the CVRA.”® The 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> specifically\ncited the CVRA requirement that agencies “engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution\nof crime shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded” their\nCVRA rights, which in 2oo5 encompassed the initial eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> provided detail regarding implementation of the Department’s CVRA\nduties and divided criminal cases into an “investigation stage,” a “prosecution stage,” and a\n“corrections stage.” The individuals responsible for notifying crime victims of their CVRA rights\nvaried depending on the stage of the proceedings.\n\nDuring the “investigation stage” of cases in which the FBI was the investigating agency,\nthe Special Agent in Charge was responsible for identifying the victims “[a]t the earliest\nopportunity after the detection of a crime” and notifying them of their rights under the CVRA and\nservices available under the VRRA and other federal statutes.\n\n[D]uring the investigative stage, [the Department] mandates\n\ncompliance with the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act, 42 U.S.C\n\n§ lo6o7, which requires federal officials to, among other things,\n\nidentify victims, protect victims, arrange for victims to receive\n\nreasonable protection from suspected offenders, and provide\nThe Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4 (Dec. l7, 2olo) (““OLC\nAvailability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo)”) and available at htps://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olce/\nopinions/2olo/l2/3 l/availability-crime-victims-rights.pdf. “That [2oo5] informal guidance did not foreclose the\npossibility that other definitions would also be reasonable.” OLC Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo) at l.\n269 The 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> are set forth in relevant part in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section II of this Report. The\nDepartment promulgated the <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> in response to a congressional directive in a predecessor statute to the CVRA,\nwhich instructed the Atorney General to develop and implement such <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>. Victim and Witness Protection Act,\nPub. L. No. 97-29l, § 6, 96 Stat. l248 (l982). The 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> were superseded in October 2oll, as explained\nbelou.\n\nl93\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3395", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003396.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22o of 348\ninformation about available services for victims. Therefore, even\nthough [the Department] may not afford CVRA rights to victims if\ncharges have not been filed in their cases, the [D]epartment may\nprovide certain services to victims that may serve the same function\nas some CVRA rights.?”\n\nThe 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> stated that the “prosecution stage” of the case began when “charges\nare filed and continue[d] through postsentencing legal proceedings.” The “U.S. Atorney in whose\ndistrict the prosecution is pending” was responsible for making “best efforts to see that crime\nvictims are notified” of their rights under the CVRA.\n\nDuring the prosecution stage, the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> required the U.S. Atorney, or a\ndesignee, to notify crime victims of case events, such as the filing of charges; the release of an\noffender; the schedule of court proceedings; the acceptance of a guilty plea or nolo contendere or\nrendering of a verdict; and any sentence imposed. The 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> required the responsible\nofficial to “provide the victim with reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding . . . that involves the crime against the victim.”\n\nThe 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult\nwith victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea\nnegotiations, and pretrial diversion. In particular, the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> required the responsible\nofficial to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views\nabout, prospective plea negotiations. Nevertheless, the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a conviction. Depending on the agency having custody of the defendant, the U.S.\nAtorney or other agencies were responsible for victim notifications during this stage.\n\nIV. USAO AND FBI VICTIM/WITNESS NOTIFICATION PRACTICE AT THE TIME\n\nOF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. USAO Training\n\nAs U.S. Atorney, Acosta disseminated the May 2oo5 updated <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> to USAO\npersonnel with a transmital memorandum dated February 27, 2oo6, stating that he expected each\nrecipient “to read and become familiar with the [2oo5] <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>.” Acosta noted in the\nmemorandum that the USAO had recently held an “all office training” addressing the 2oo5\n<span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> and that new USAO atorneys who missed the training were required to view a\nvideotaped version of the training “immediately.” Acosta further noted that the USAO’s\n27o GAO CVRA Awareness Report at 66.\n\nl94\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3396", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003397.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22l of 348\nvictim/witness staff were “ready to assist you with the details of victim notification, and other\nareas for which United States Atorney[’]s Offices are nou explicitly responsible under the act.”\nThe USAO’s Victim Witness Program Coordinator told OPR that the USAO provided annual\nmandatory office-wide training on victim/witness issues and training for new employees.\n\nB. The Automated Victim Notification System\n\nBoth the FBI and the USAO manage contacts with crime victims through the Victim\nNotification System (VNS), an automated system maintained by the Executive Office for United\nStates Atorneys. The 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> mandated that “victim contact information and notice to\nvictims of events . . . shall, absent exceptional circumstances (such as cases involving juvenile or\nforeign victims), be conducted and maintained using VNS.” The VNS is separate from agency\ncase management systems maintained by the FBI and the USAO. Both the FBI and the USAO\nuse the VNS to generate form leters to victims at various points in the investigation and the\nprosecution of a criminal case. Although each form leter can be augmented to add some limited\nindividual mater-specific content, the leters contain specific language concerning the purpose of\nthe contact that cannot be removed (such as the arrest of the defendant or the scheduling of a\nsentencing hearing).?”!\n\nIn the usual course of a criminal case, the FBI collects victim contact information during\nthe investigation stage, which it stores in its case management system. The FBI’s Victim Specialist\nexports the victim information data from the FBI’s case management system into the VNS\ndatabase. Victim information stored in the VNS is linked to the investigation’s VNS case number.\nAt the time of the Epstein investigation, the FBI’s Victim Specialist could use the VNS to generate\nseven different form notification leters: (l) initial notification; (2) case is under investigation;\n(3) arrest of the defendant; (4) declination of prosecution; (5) other; (6) advice of victim rights;\nand (7) investigation closed.\n\nAfter a charging document has been filed and the “prosecution stage” begins, the USAO’s\nVictim Witness Specialist assumes responsibility for victim notification.””” The USAO imports\ndata from its case management system into the VNS and links to the previously loaded FBI VNS\ndata. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist uses the VNS to generate form leters providing\nnotice of case events, such as charges filed; an arraignment; a proposed plea agreement; change of\nplea hearings; sentencing hearings; and the result of sentencing hearings.\neth US. Dept. of Justice Office of the Inspector General Audit Division Audit Report o8-o4, The Department of\nJustice’s Victim Notification System at 29 (Jan. 2oo8), available at htps://oig justice.gov/reports/EOUS A/ao8o4/\nfinal.pdf. The 2oo8 audit identified concerns with the VNS templates, including that ““VNS users . . . cannot alter the\nformat to ensure that it fits with the specific case for which it is being sent,” and many users had noted that “information\nin notifications became confusing and sometimes contradictory when various types of notifications were combined in\nthe same leter.”\n\n272 The FBI and the USAO have different titles for the individual who maintains victim contact: the FBI title is\n“Victim Specialist,” and the USAO title is “Victim Witness Specialist.”\nl95\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3397", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003398.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 222 of 348\n\nC. FBI Victim Notification Pamphlets\n\nThe 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> recommended that “victims be given a printed brochure or card that\nbriefly describes their rights and available services . . . and [contact information for] the victim-\nwitness coordinator or specialist....” At the time of the Epstein investigation, FBI agents\nnationwide routinely folloued a practice of providing victims with pamphlets entitled, “Help for\nVictims of Crime” and “The Department of Justice Victim Notification System.” The “Help for\nVictims of Crime” pamphlet contained a listing of the eight CVRA rights. The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview. The pamphlet entitled “The\nDepartment of Justice Victim Notification System” provided an overview of the VNS and\ninstructions on hou to access the system.\n\nV. THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim Notification Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\nSpecialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\nNotification Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.7”° Thereafter, the Victim Specialist\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”?”*\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim Specialist\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\n\n2o8 These 3o were drawn from the PBPD investigative file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\ndesignated as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed.\n274 The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim Specialist] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights . .. and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim Specialist.”\nl96\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3398", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003400.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 224 of 348\nIf you have additional questions which involve this matier, please contact the offics listed above.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim Specialist was preparing and sending FBI victim\nnotification leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t . . . have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\n<span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?”\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nat OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34oo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003401.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 225 of 348\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they .. . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?7”\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.*’* Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing of a criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially receiving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “‘adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\nant Villafafia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\nSpecialist who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\naus Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n\n279 Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [<span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\nl99\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34ol", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003421.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 245 of 348\nhave “notified [the victims] that that was an all-encompassing plea, that that state court sentence\nwould also mean that the federal government was not proceeding.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he thought Acosta and Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Sigal Mandelker had agreed that the decision whether to notify the victims of the state\ncourt proceedings should be “left to the state.”*3 Mandelker, houever, had no memory of advising\nAcosta to defer the decision to make notifications to the State Atorney, and she noted that the\n“correspondence [OPR] provided to me from that time period” discussing such a decision\n“demonstrates that all of the referenced language came from Mr. Acosta and/or his team, and that\nI did not provide, suggest, or edit the language.” Sloman told OPR that he initially believed that\n“the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially because they had restitution rights\nunder § 2255”; but, his expectations changed after “there was an agreement made that we were\ngoing to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to decide hou the victims were going\nto be notified.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek told OPR that she did not at any time receive a victim\nlist from the USAO. She further said she did not receive any request from the USAO with regard\nto contacting the victims.\n\nIn response to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter, Lefkouitz asserted that the FBI should\nnot communicate with the victims, and that the state, not the USAO, should determine who can be\nheard at the sentencing hearing:\n\n[Y]our leter also suggests that our objection to your Office’s\n\nproposed victims notification leter was that the women identified\n\nas victims of federal crimes should not be notified of the state\n\nproceedings. That is not true, as our previous leter clearly states.\n\nPuting aside our threshold contention that many of those to whom\n\n[CVRA] notification leters are intended are in fact not victims as\n\ndefined in the Atorney General’s 2ooo Victim Witness\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>—a status requiring physical, emotional or pecuniary\n\ninjury of the [victim]—it was and remains our position that these\n\nwomen may be notified of such proceedings but since they are\n\nneither witnesses nor victims to the state prosecution of this mater,\n\nthey should not be informed of fictitious “rights” or invited to make\n\nsworn writen or in-court testimonial statements against Mr. Epstein\n\nat such proceedings, as Ms. Villafafia repeatedly maintained they\n\nhad the right to do. Additionally, it was and remains our position\n\nthat any notification should be by mail and that all proactive efforts\n\nby the FBI to have communications with the witnesses after the\n\nexecution of the Agreement should finally come to an end. We\n\nagree, houever, with your December l9 modification of the\n\npreviously drafted federal notification leter and agree that the\n323 In his June 3, 2oo8 leter to Deputy Atorney General Mark Filip, Sloman wrote, “Acosta again consulted\nwith DAAG Mandelker who advised him to make the follouing proposal [to defer notification to the State Atorney’s\nOffice].” OPR found no other documentation relating to Mandelker’s purported involvement in the decision.\n\n2l9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo342l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003422.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 246 of 348\ndecision as to who can be heard at a state sentencing is, amongst\nmany other issues, properly within the aegis of state decision\nmaking.*”4\n\nFollouing a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, in which Acosta asked that the\ndefense clarify its positions on the USAO proposals regarding, among other things, notifications\nto the victims, Lefkouitz responded with a December 26, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, objecting again to\nnotification of the victims. Lefkouitz argued that CVRA notification was not appropriate because\nthe Atorney General <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> defined “crime victim” as a person harmed as a result of an\noffense charged in federal district court, and Epstein had not been charged in federal court.\nNevertheless, Lefkouitz added that, despite their objection to CVRA notification, “[W]e do not\nobject (as we made clear in our leter last week) that some form of notice be given to the alleged\nvictims.” Lefkouitz requested both that the defense be given an opportunity to review any notice\nsent by the USAO, and that “any and all notices with respect to the alleged victims of state offenses\nshould be sent by the State Atorney rather than [the USAO],” and he agreed that the USAO\n“should defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding all maters with regard to those\nvictims and the state proceedings.”\n\nMonths later, in April 2oo8, Epstein’s atorneys complained in a leter to Mandelker that\nSloman and Villafafia commited professional misconduct by threatening to send a “highly\nimproper and unusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” victims.\n\nF. January — June 2oo8: While the Defense Presses Its Appeal to the Department\n\nin an Effort to Undo the NPA, the FBI and the USAO Continue Investigating\nEpstein\n\nAs described in Chapter Two of this Report, from the time the NPA was signed through\nthe end of June 2oo8, the defense employed various measures to delay, or avoid entirely,\nimplementation of the NPA. Ultimately, defense counsel’s advocacy resulted in the USAO’s\ndecision to have the federal case reviewed afresh. A review of the evidence was undertaken first\nby USAO Criminal Chief Robert Senior and then, briefly, by an experienced CEOS trial\natorney. A review of the case in light of the defense challenges was then conducted by CEOS\nChief Oosterban, in consultation with his staff and with Deputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal\nMandelker and Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher, and then by the Office of the Deputy\nAtorney General. Each review took weeks and delayed Epstein’s entry of his state guilty plea.\n\nAs set forth belou, during that time, Villafafia and the FBI continued investigating and\nworking touard potential federal charges.\n\nl. Villafafia Prepares to Contact Victims in Anticipation That Epstein\nWill Breach the NPA\n\nOn January 3, 2oo8, the local newspaper reported that Epstein’s plea conference in state\ncourt, at that point set for early January, had been rescheduled to March 2oo8, at which time he\nwould plead guilty to felony solicitation of prostitution, and that “in exchange” for the guilty plea,\n324 The 2ooo <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> were superseded by the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>.\n\n22o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3422", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003430.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 254 of 348\ncamera memory cards seized by the PBPD in order to have them forensically examined for deleted\nimages that could contain child pornography.*”\n\nBy early April 2oo8, as the defense pursued its appeal to the Department’s Criminal\nDivision, Acosta predicted in an email to Villafafia and Sloman that federal charges against Epstein\nwere “more and more likely.” Villafafia asked Oosterban for help to “move this [Criminal\nDivision review] process along,” noting that the defense continued to undermine the government’s\ncase by deposing the victims “under the guise of ‘trial prep’ for the state case” and that the “agents\nand the victims” were “losing their patience.”\n\nOn April 24, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman and USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior\nasking whether she had the “green light” to file charges and raising the same concerns she had\nexpressed to Oosterban. Villafafia further cautioned that, although she was planning to file\ncharges on May 6, if that was not going to happen, “then we all need to meet with the victims, the\nagents, and the police officers to decide hou the case will be resolved and to provide them with an\nexplanation for the delay.” Because the Department’s Criminal Division did not conclude its\nreview of Epstein’s appeal by May 6, houever, Villafafia did not file charges that day.\n\nVill. USAO SUPERVISORS CONSIDER CVRA OBLIGATIONS IN AN UNRELATED\n\nMATTER AND IN LIGHT OF A NEW FIFTH CIRCUIT OPINION\n\nDuring the period after the NPA was signed, and before Epstein complied with the NPA\nby entering his state guilty pleas, the USAO supervisors were explicitly made aware of a conflict\nbetween the Department’s position that CVRA’s victims’ rights atached upon the filing of a\ncriminal charge and a new federal appellate ruling to the contrary. The contemporaneous\ncommunications confirm that in 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman were aware of the Department’s policy\nregarding the issue.\n\nUnrelated to the Epstein investigation, on April l8, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman received a\ncitizen complaint from an atorney who requested to meet with them regarding his belief that the\nFlorida Bar had violated his First Amendment rights. The atorney asserted that the CVRA\nguaranteed him “an absolute right to meet” with USAO officials because he believed that he was\nthe victim of a federal crime. Acosta forwarded the message to the USAO Appellate Division\nChief, who informed Acosta and Sloman that, according to the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, “our obligations\nunder [the CVRA] are not triggered until charges are filed”’ On April 24, 2oo8, the Appellate\nDivision Chief emailed Acosta and Sloman, stating that she had “confirmed with DOJ that [her]\nreading of [the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>] is correct and that our obligations under [the CVRA] are not\ntriggered until a case is filed.”?*\n\nOn May 7, 2oo8, the Appellate Division Chief sent Acosta and Sloman a copy of a U.S.\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit opinion issued that day, Jn re Dean, holding that a victim’s\noe The forensic examination did not locate useful evidence on the memory cards.\n\n343 The Appellate Division Chief advised Acosta that Acosta could inform the complainant that, prior to the\ninitiation of charges, the investigating agency was responsible for carrying out the Department’s statutory obligations\nto the victim.\n228\nDOJ-OGR-oooo343o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003431.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 255 of 348\nCVRA rights atach prior to the filing of criminal charges.*44 The Appellate Division Chief noted\nthat, although the holding conflicted with the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, the “court’s opinion makes sense.”\n\nDean involved a federal prosecution arising from a 2oo5 explosion at an oil refinery\noperated by BP Products North America, Inc. (BP) that killed l5 people and injured more than\nl7o. Before bringing criminal charges, the government negotiated a guilty plea with BP without\nnotifying the victims. The government filed a sealed motion, alerting the district court to the\npotential plea and claiming that consultation with all the victims was impractical and that such\nnotification could result in media coverage that would undermine the plea negotiations. The court\nthen entered an order prohibiting the government from notifying the victims of the pending plea\nagreement until after it had been signed by the parties. Thereafter, the government filed a criminal\ninformation, the government and BP signed the plea agreement, and the government mailed notices\nof the plea hearing to the victims informing them of their right to be heard. One month later, l2\nvictims asked the court to reject the plea because it was entered into in violation of their rights\nunder the CVRA. The district court denied their motion, but concluded that the CVRA rights to\nconfer with the prosecutor in the case and to be treated with fairness and respect for the victim’s\ndignity and privacy vested prior to the initiation of charges.*4° The district court noted that the\nlegislative history reflected a view that “the right to confer was intended to be broad,” as well as\nbeing a “mechanism[]” to ensure that victims were treated with fairness.\n\nIn denying the victims relief, the Fifth Circuit nevertheless concluded that the district court\n“failed to accord the victims the rights conferred by the CVRA.”*“° In particular, the Fifth Circuit\ncited the district court’s acknouledgement that “[t]here are clearly rights under the CVRA that\napply before any prosecution is underway.” The Fifth Circuit also noted that such consultation\nwas not “an infringement” on the government’s independent prosecutorial discretion, but “it is\nonly a requirement that the government confer in some reasonable way with the victims before\nultimately exercising its broad discretion.” In the wake of the Dean opinion, two Department\ncomponents wrote separate memoranda to the Solicitor General with opposing views concerning\nwhether the CVRA right to confer with the prosecution vests prior to the initiation of a prosecution.\nIX. JUNE 2oo8: VILLAFANA’S PRE-PLEA CONTACTS WITH THE ATTORNEY\n\nREPRESENTING THE VICTIMS WHO LATER BECAME THE CVRA\n\nPETITIONERS\n\nAccording to an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation by her atorney, Bradley Edwards,\nWild retained Edwards in June 2oo8 to represent her “because she was unable to get anyone from\nthe [USAO] to tell her what was actually going on with the federal criminal case against Jeffrey\nEpstein.”*4” Villafafia told OPR that Wild did not contact her directly and she was not aware of\naH In re Dean, 527 F.3d 39l (Sth Cir. 2oo8).

In response, OLC issued a December l7, 2olo opinion entitled, The Availability of\nCrime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4. Based on the CVRA’s\nlanguage, relevant case law, and memoranda opinions from Department components, OLC\nreaffirmed its 2oo5 conclusion that CVRA rights do not vest until a criminal charge has been filed\n(by complaint, information, or indictment) and the rights cease to be available if “all charges are\ndismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or if the [g]overnment declines to bring formal\ncharges after the filing of a complaint).”?”\n\nAfter OLC issued its opinion, the Department revised the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> in October 2oll\nbut did not change its fundamental position that the CVRA rights did not vest until after criminal\ncharges were filed. The 2oll revision did, houever, add language concerning victim consultation\nbefore a defendant is charged: “In circumstances where plea negotiations occur before a case has\nbeen brought, Department policy is that this should include reasonable consultation prior to the\nfiling of a charging instrument with the court.”*” The use of the word “should” in the 2oll\n<span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> indicates that “personnel are expected to take the action . . . unless there is an\nappropriate, articulable reason not to do so.”°°° Nevertheless, the required consultation “may be\ngeneral in nature” and “does not have to be specific to a particular plea offer.”°*! The revisions\nalso specified that AUSAs were to ensure that victims had a right to be reasonably heard at plea\nproceedings.**\n\nOn November 2, 2oll, U.S. Senator Jon Kyl, a co-sponsor of the CVRA, sent a leter to\nAtorney General Eric Holder, arguing that the 2oll <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> revisions “conflict[ed] quite\nclearly with the CVRA’s plain language” because the 2oll <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> did “not extend any rights\nto victims until charges have been filed.” The Department’s response emphasized that the\n378 OLC “express[ed] no opinion” as to whether it is a mater of “good practice” to inform victims of their CVRA\nrights prior to the filing of a complaint or after the dismissal of charges.\nae See 2oll <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, Art. V, § G.2, available at htps://(www_justice.gov/sites/default/files/olp/docs/\nag guidelines2ol2. pdf.

See 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, Art. IV,\n4 C.3.b.(2). Houever, the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> generally require AUSAs to use their best efforts to comply with the\nCVRA, and the CVRA specifically affords victims the right to be heard at plea proceedings. The 2oll revision\nremedied this omission.\n\n24l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3443", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003444.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 268 of 348\nDepartment had made its “best efforts in thousands of federal and District of Columbia cases to\nassert, support, and defend crime victims’ rights.” The response also referenced OLC’s December\n2olo opinion concluding that CVRA rights apply when criminal proceedings are initiated, noting\nthat “the new AG <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> go further and provide that Department prosecutors should make\nreasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about, prospective\nplea negotiations, even prior to the filing of a charging instrument with the court.”**\n\nIn 2ol5, Congress amended the CVRA, and added the follouing two rights:\n\n(9) The right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain\nor deferred prosecution agreement.\n\n(lo) The right to be informed of the rights under this section and the\nservices described in section 5o3(c) of the Victims’ Rights and\nRestitution Act of l99o (42 U.S.C. lo6o7(c)) and provided contact\ninformation for the Office of the Victims’ Rights Ombudsman of the\nDepartment of Justice.\n\nG. The CVRA Litigation Proceedings and Current Status\n\nWhile the CVRA litigation was pending in the Southern District of Florida, numerous\nfederal civil suits against Epstein, brought in the same district, were transferred to the same judge\nas “related cases,” as a mater of judicial economy pursuant to the Local Rules. As the parties\nagreed on setlements in those civil cases, they were dismissed.*** Several of the victims who had\nsetled their civil cases filed a pleading in the CVRA litigation asking the court to “maintain their\nanonymity” and not “further disseminate[]” their identities to the CVRA petitioners.**°\n\nIn the CVRA case, the petitioners claimed that the government violated their CVRA rights\nto confer by (l) negotiating and signing the NPA without victim input; (2) sending leters to the\nvictims claiming that the mater was “under investigation” after the NPA was already signed; and\n(3) not properly informing the victims that the state plea would also resolve the federal\ninvestigation. In addition, the petitioners alleged that the government violated their CVRA right\nto be treated with fairness by concealing the NPA negotiation and also violated their CVRA right\nto reasonable notice by concealing that the state court proceeding impacted the enforcement of the\nNPA and resolved the federal investigation.\n\nDuring the litigation, the USAO argued that (l) the victims had no right to notice or\nconferral about the NPA because the CVRA rights did not apply pre-charge; (2) the government’s\n383 l57 Cong. Rec. $7359-o2 (2oll) (Kyl leter and Department response).\na8e Epstein also resolved some county court civil cases during this time period as well. In addition, numerous\nother cases were resolved outside of formal litigation. For example, one atorney told OPR that he resolved l6 victim\ncases, but did not file all cases with the court.

Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR that, while there were\nvalid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is\na case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required. I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [victim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key conclusion that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for resolution after development of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\nintention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\nconcluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[iJt was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”>*°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, “[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]uidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3445", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003446.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27o of 348\nthe 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> was inconsistent with positions the USAO had taken in correspondence with\nEpstein’s atorneys, in which the government acknouledged that “it had obligations to notify the\nvictims.” The court ordered the parties to submit additional briefs regarding the appropriate\nremedies. Accordingly, the petitioners requested multiple specific remedies, including rescission\nof the NPA; a writen apology to all victims from the government; a meeting with Acosta,\nVillafafia, and her supervisors; access to government records, including grand jury materials;\ntraining for USAO employees; and monetary sanctions and atorneys’ fees.*°”\n\nFollouing Epstein’s indictment on federal charges in New York and subsequent death\nwhile in custody, on September l6, 2ol9, the district judge presiding over the CVRA case denied\nthe petitioners’ motion for remedies and closed the case, stating that Epstein’s death “rendered the\nmost significant issue that was pending before the Court, namely, whether the Government’s\nviolation of Petitioners’ rights under the CVRA invalidated the NPA, moot.”**8 The court did not\norder the government to take corrective measures, but stated that it “fully expects the Government\nwill honor its representation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the\nproper treatment of crime victims.”**’ The court also denied the petitioners’ request for atorneys’\nfees, finding that the government did not act in bad faith, because, “[a]lthough unsuccessful on the\nmerits of the issue of whether there was a violation of the CVRA, the Government asserted\nlegitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation.”\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, Wild appealed the district court’s rejection of the requested\nremedies, through a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit.*”° In its responsive brief, the government expressed sympathy for Wild and\n“regret[] [for] the manner in which it communicated with her in the past.”*?!

In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”°”°\n\nA. At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—is “always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’”*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\nfab 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, Foreword.\nso Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3458", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003459.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 283 of 348\nand consider victims’ views about, prospective plea negotiations.*”* The “prosecution stage”\nbegan when charges were filed and continued through all post-sentencing legal proceedings.*””\n\nAt the time the parties signed the NPA in September 2oo7, few courts had addressed victim\nstanding under the CVRA. Notably, district courts in New York and South Carolina had ruled that\nstanding atached only upon the filing of federal charges.*°’ Two cases relied upon by the court\nin its February 2ol9 opinion—Dean and its underlying district court opinion, BP Products—were\ndecided after the NPA was signed.\n\nThe CVRA litigation and proposed federal legislation—both pending as of the date of this\nReport—shou that the interpretation of victim standing under the CVRA continues to be a mater\nof debate.**! In a November 2l, 2ol9 leter to Atorney General William Barr, a Congressional\nRepresentative stated that she had recently introduced legislation specifically to “[c]larify that\nvictims of federal crimes have the right to confer with the Government and be informed about key\npre-charging developments in a case, such as . . . non-prosecution agreements.”*° The CVRA\nlitigation arising from the Epstein case shous the lack of clarity regarding when CVRA rights\napply: the district court concluded that CVRA rights applied pre-charge, but a sharply divided\npanel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals came to a contrary conclusion, a decision that has\nnou been vacated while the entire court hears the case en banc.\n\nBecause the Supreme Court had not addressed the issue of when CVRA rights apply, the\nlouer courts had reached divergent conclusions, and the Department had concluded that CVRA\nrights did not apply pre-charge, OPR concludes that the subjects’ failure to consult with victims\nbefore signing the NPA did not constitute professional misconduct because at that time, the CVRA\ndid not clearly and unambiguously require prosecutors to consult with victims before the filing of\nfederal criminal charges.*\n\n398 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, Art.

The court found violations of Maryland Rules of Professional\n\n257\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3459", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003460.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 284 of 348\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel compared the language of the CVRA to the language\nof the VRRA, noting that the VRRA “clearly extends victim-notice rights into the pre-charge\nphase” and opining that the government “may well have violated” the VRRA with regards to its\ninvestigation of Epstein. As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by administrative complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official\nto “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”’—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\nidentified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the\nvictims with appropriate notification.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no recollection of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the right, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and.\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR-oooo346o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003463.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 287 of 348\nrequire victim approval of the prosecutors’ plans, but it allous victims the opportunity to express\ntheir views and to be heard before a final decision is made. The lack of consultation in this case\ndenied the victims that opportunity.*°\nI. LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\n\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\nresolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.” 4\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim Specialist. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\n4o8 Villafafia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\n<span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, Art. IV, § B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners. Doe, 359 F. Supp. 3d at l2l8.\n\n4o9 Doe, 359 F.

The USAO Was Not Responsible for Victim Notification Leters Sent by the\n\nFBI in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and May 2oo8 Describing the Status of\nthe Case as “Under Investigation”\n\nThe 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> charged the FBI with informing the victims of CVRA rights and\navailable services during the “investigative stage” of a case. During the Epstein investigation, the\nFBI case agents complied with the agency’s notification obligation by hand delivering pamphlets\nto victims follouing their interviews and through computer-generated leters sent to the victims by\nthe FBI’s Victim Specialist. The FBI’s notification process is independent of the USAO’s. The\nUSAO has its oun Victim Witness Specialist who assumes the responsibility for victim\nnotification after an indictment or complaint moved the case into the “prosecution stage.”\n\nThe FBI’s Victim Specialist used the VNS to prepare the October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8 leters, a system the FBI regularly employs to comply with its obligations under the\n2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> to inform the victims of their rights and other services during the “investigative\nstage.” The stock language of that leter, houever, was generic and failed to communicate the\nunique case-specific status of the Epstein investigation at that time. The FBI Victim Specialist\nwho sent the leters acted at the case agent’s direction and was not aware of the existence of the\nNPA at the time she created the leters.*!° Neither FBI case agent reviewed any of the leters sent\nby the FBI’s Victim Specialist.*!! According to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the leters and\nthe wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Although the FBI case agents\ninformed Villafafia after the fact that the FBI’s Victim Specialist sent her “standard form leter,”\nVillafafia had never reviewed an FBI-generated victim notification leter and was not aware of its\ncontents.*!? Villafafia told OPR she was unaware of the content of the FBI leters until they were\ncollected for the CVRA litigation, sometime after July 2oo8.\n\n4lo The case agent told OPR that she did not recall specifically directing the Victim Specialist to send a leter,\nbut acknouledged that “she would come to us before she would approach a victim.”\n\naul The case agent told OPR that she had no role in drafting the leters and believed them to be “standard form\nleters.” Similarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “I can’t think that I’ve ever reviewed any of them . . . they just go\nfrom the victim coordinator.”\n\nale Villafafia’s lack of familiarity with the language in the FBI leters led to some inconsistency in the\ninformation provided to victims concerning their CVRA rights. Beginning in 2oo6, the FBI provided to victims\nstandard leters advising victims of their CVRA rights but which also noted that only some of the rights applied\npre-charge. During this period, Villafafia also crafted her oun introductory leters to the victims to let them knou of\ntheir CVRA rights and that the federal investigation “would be a different process” from the prior state investigation\nin which “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated by the State Atorney’s Office.” Villafafia told\nOPR that in a case in which she “need[ed] to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia’s leter itemized the CVRA\nrights, but it did not explain that those rights atached only after a formal charge had been made. The leter was hand\n\n262\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3464", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003481.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o5 of 348\nand they often cannot fully reveal either the facts or the status of an investigation, even with\nvictims. The 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> advise that in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited\nin their disclosures: “Because victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government,\nand may disclose whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only nonsensitive data and\npublic information.”*°\n\nVillafafia’s concern about generating potential impeachment evidence by informing\nvictims of their potential to recover monetary damages from Epstein was not unreasonable.\nIndeed, the case agents initially raised the impeachment issue, and after considering the problem,\nVillafafia agreed with the agents’ concerns. Villafafia raised those concerns with the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer in October 2oo7 after the agents brought the issue to her\natention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom\nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound. OPR also considered that although\nVillafafia had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her\nsupervisor, the U.S. Atorney, had decided otherwise. When authorized to inform Edwards of the\nscheduled change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global resolution that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) atendance at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the resolution of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).4* Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential conclusion of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\nHe 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, Art. IV, J B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim notification leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\n\n“44 The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\nresolution of a sex abuse case. Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR-oooo348l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003482.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o6 of 348\nintentionally concealing information from them and was part of a series of interactions with\nvictims that led to condemnation of the government’s treatment of victims. **°\nVI. THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO TREAT VICTIMS FORTHRIGHTLY AND\n\nWITH SENSITIVITY WHEN IT FAILED TO TIMELY PROVIDE VICTIMS\n\nWITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESOLUTION OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAlthough OPR does not conclude that any of the subjects commited professional\nmisconduct, either by failing to consult with the victims before the NPA was signed or in\ninteractions afterwards, OPR’s findings are not an endorsement of the government’s course of\naction. The government’s interactions with victims confused and frustrated many of the victims,\nparticularly the two CVRA petitioners and the two victims who had unsuccessfully atempted to\njoin in the CVRA litigation. As a result, the victims’ and the public’s perception of the mater is\nthat the prosecutors worked with Epstein’s atorneys to disenfranchise and silence the victims. It\nis unfortunate, and appears fundamentally unfair to the victims, that Acosta and Sloman (after\nMenchel and Lourie departed) took the unusual step of deciding to vet the USAO victim\nnotification leters with the defense after the NPA was signed, but failed to go beyond the\nrequirements of the CVRA or the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> to consult with the victims before the NPA was\nsigned. This result is contrary to the Department’s intent, as set forth in the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, that\nDepartment employees work to “minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of crime\nendure in its wake.” When considering the entirety of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by\nthe Department.\n\nWild’s criticisms of the government’s conduct were based on interactions that are similar\nto and generally representative of the government’s interactions with other Epstein victims and\nthat demonstrate an overall lack of sensitivity to the victims by the government. Wild experienced\na series of confusing and inconsistent communications in her interactions with Villafafia and the\ncase agents. Wild received Villafafia’s leter in June 2oo7 stating inaccurately that she was a\nfederal victim entitled to CVRA rights. She was interviewed by the FBI in August 2oo7 but was\nnot told that a potential outcome was a state plea. Shortly after the September 24, 2oo7 signing of\nthe NPA, the FBI contacted her to inform her of the resolution of the federal case. Nonetheless,\non January lo, 2oo8, the FBI sent her a victims’ rights leter indicating that the case was under\ninvestigation and that some of her CVRA rights may not apply until after the defendant was\ncharged. On January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia re-interviewed Wild, along with a CEOS atorney and\nthe FBI] agents, and told Wild that the case was under investigation, but did not specifically mention\nthe NPA, although she may have mentioned a possible resolution. In mid-June 2oo8, when\nEdwards contacted Villafafia on Wild’s behalf, Villafafia informed him that the case was under\ninvestigation but did not mention the NPA. Just before Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8 state court plea,\n“45 OPR notes that, similar to Villafafia, Sloman interacted with a victim’s atorney during the time period\nbetween the signing of the NPA and Epstein’s state guilty plea. In January 2oo8, Sloman received a telephone call\nfrom his former law partner, who represented one of the victims and who asked Sloman whether the federal\ngovernment could bring charges against Epstein. Sloman, concerned about the potential for conflict of interest\nallegations due to his prior business relations with the atorney, refused to answer any questions regarding Epstein.\nBecause Sloman refused to provide any information, OPR found no basis for finding that Sloman misled the atorney.\n\n28o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3482", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003484.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o8 of 348\nto be paid to the FBI’s communications to ensure that the victims were receiving accurate and\ntimely information that was consistent with the status of the case and with the USAO’s\ncommunications with victims.*4”\n\nThe decision not to inform victims and their atorneys about the existence of the NPA gave\nvictims and the public the misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel\nto keep the agreement secret from the victims. Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“48 For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities. In certain cases, such as the\nEpstein case, prosecutors may need to provide more oversight when multiple Department\ncomponents are communicating with victims to avoid providing confusing and contradictory\nmessages.\nindependent of the NPA provision. OPR also notes that impeachment regarding the NPA provision may have\npermited the government to rehabilitate the victims through their prior statements to law enforcement. In other words,\nwhile the USAO’s view concerning potential impeachment was not unreasonable, more extensive consideration of the\ncase agent’s concerns might have led the prosecutors to conclude that the risk of the information being used to\nsignificantly damage the credibility of the victims was lou.\n\nHe In addition to the FBI leters previously discussed, another example of the inconsistent communication can\nbe seen in leters that were to be sent after Epstein entered his guilty plea to two victims residing in foreign countries.\nAlthough OPR was unable to confirm that the two victims actually received the leters, it appears from the records\nOPR reviewed that the government intended to provide them with a standard FBI leter stating that the case was under\ninvestigation while also providing them with a USAO leter stating that the case had been resolved through Epstein’s\nstate guilty plea.\n\n448 OPR understands that the Department is in the process of revising the 2oll <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>.\n\n282\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3484", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003889.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document223 Filed o4/2o/2l Page l6 of 23\nconsider extrinsic evidence of the parties’ intent.’ To the extent that the Court finds that\nextrinsic evidence is relevant, houever, the government’s argument demonstrates precisely why\nthe Court should permit discovery in this action. While the government ludicrously faults Ms.\nMaxwell for failing to produce “documentary evidence” of the parties’ intent and the scope of\nthe SDFL investigation (Opp. lo), Ms. Maxwell, as a nonparty to the NPA, has no access to such\nevidence without discovery. Any evidence of the parties’ intent would be in the possession of\nthe government and Epstein’s counsel, and at this stage, Ms. Maxwell can only scour the few\nclues available to the public—such as a privilege log filed in a related civil lawsuit—for crumbs\nof information about the negotiation and investigation.\n\nThe government’s response to those crumbs illustrates why any consideration of extrinsic\nevidence—which, as noted above, is unnecessary given the unambiguous text of the NPA—\nshould be preceded by discovery. In her opening memorandum, Ms. Maxwell cited to three\npages from the above-referenced privilege log in a civil lawsuit filed by one of Epstein’s victims,\nall of which contain entries reflecting the USAO-SDFL’s consultation with the United States\nAtorney’s Office for this District, travel by USAO-SDFL atorneys to New York, or interviews\nand/or subpoenas of New York-based witnesses. Mem. at ll (citing Privilege Log, Doe v.\nUnited States, Case No. 9:o8-CV-8o736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkt. No. 2l2-l (filed July l9, 2ol3)\n(“SDFL Privilege Log”), at 4, 5, 7). In response, the government has focused on only one of\nthose three entries and produced the documents referenced in the privilege log. See Opp. lo.\n\n7 The government’s argument that a United States Atorney lacks the “authority” to bind other districts (Opp. l3-\nl4)—and that the government can simply walk away from a plea agreement in which a United States Atorney has\nnot received the approvals prescribed by internal Justice Department <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>—is unavailing. The government\ncites no case in which a court has invalidated a plea agreement on this basis, and its argument is contradicted not\nonly by the Third, Fourth, and Eighth circuits—in which the default rule is that plea agreements bind other\ndistricts—but also by the Second Circuit’s statement that a United States Atorney may bind other districts in a plea\nagreement if there is an affirmative appearance to that effect.

Harvey, 79l F.2d\n294, 3o3 (4th Cir. l986); Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672.\n\nl2\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3889", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003907.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 224 _ Filed o4/2o/2l Pageloofl7\nguilt or should be so incredible that its very implausibility suggests that it was created to conceal\nguilt.” United States vy. Litlefield, 84o F.2d l43, l49 (lst Cir. l988) (internal citations and\nquotations omited). That is not the case here. Moreover, the government cites no case where a\npurportedly false response in an unrelated civil deposition was admissible as a false exculpatory\nstatement in a criminal case. Accordingly, the Perjury Counts should be severed and tried\nseparately.*\n\nII. The Perjury Counts Must Be Severed to Prevent the Introduction of\n\nImproper, Highly Prejudicial, and Inadmissible Evidence.\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure l4(a), captioned “Relief from Prejudicial Joinder,”\nconfers upon a trial court the discretion to sever even properly joined counts if “justice requires.”\nThe rule provides, in pertinent part: “If the joinder of offenses ...in an indictment . . . appears\nto prejudice a defendant or the government, the court may order separate trials of counts . . . or\nprovide any other relief that justice requires.” Fed. R. Crim. P. l4(a).\n\nThere can be litle doubt that if the Perjury Counts are not severed, Ms. Maxwell will\nsuffer substantial prejudice. The government’s proof of the Mann Act Counts will come almost\nexclusively from the testimony of the three accusers, with litle or no independent documentary\ncorroboration. Adding the Perjury Counts, which involve allegations of sexual abuse by another\nalleged victim that are unrelated to the charged crimes, will create a significant risk that the jury\nwill impermissibly use the evidence introduced in connection with the Perjury Counts “to infer a\ncriminal disposition” on the part of Ms. Maxwell to commit the Mann Act violations, or might\n> Tt is highly unlikely that two trials would occur in this mater. Should the case proceed to trial on Counts\nl-4, only, a conviction would expose Ms. Maxwell to a significant term of imprisonment.

No second trial would be necessary. If\nMs. Maxwell were acquited, issue-preclusion would bar any second trial. See Yeager v.

Late July 2oo6: The State Indicts Epstein, and the USAO Moves\nForward with a Federal Investigation\n\nSeveral days after Villafafia spoke with Acosta and Sloman, on July l9, 2oo6, Assistant\nState Atorney Belohlavek presented the case to the state grand jury.~> Krischer told OPR that\n“the whole thing” was put before the grand jury. According to a statement made at the time by the\nState Atorney’s Office spokesman, the grand jury was presented with a list of charges from highest\nto louest, without a recommendation by the prosecutor, and deliberated with the prosecutor out of\nthe room.”* The state grand jury returned an indictment charging Epstein with one count of felony\nsolicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7, a felony under state law because\nit alleged three or more instances of solicitation.” The indictment did not identify the person or\npersons solicited and made no mention of the fact that Epstein had solicited minors.*® On July 23,\n2oo6, Epstein self-surrendered to be arrested on the indictment, but was not detained, and the\ncharges were made public.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she decided to move forward with the federal investigation at that\npoint because she believed the State Atorney’s Office would permit Epstein to enter a plea to a\nreduced misdemeanor charge and that once he entered a guilty plea, the Department’s Petite policy\nmight preclude a federal prosecution.”’ Villafafia told OPR that at the time, she “definitely\nbelieved that we were going to proceed to [a federal] indictment, assuming that ...we had\nsufficient evidence.”\neS Villafafia and the FBI obtained and examined records of the state grand jury proceeding, and Lourie reviewed\nthem. Because the grand jury records have not been ordered released publicly, OPR does not discuss their substance\nin this Report.\nat Larry Keller, “Police say lawyer tried to discredit teenage girls,” Palm Beach Post, July 29, 2oo6, citing\nstatement by State Atorney’s Office spokesman Michael Edmondson.\n28 Indictment in State v. Epstein, 2oo6CF9454AXX (July l9, 2oo6), atached as Exhibit l to this Report.\n26 In pertinent part, the state indictment read, “[B]etween the Ist day of August [2oo4] and October 3l, 2oo5,\n[Epstein] did solicit, induce, entice, or procure another to commit prostitution lewdness, or assignation, . . . on three\nor more occasions.” The l5-month time frame and lack of detail regarding the place or manner of the offense made\nit impossible to identify from the charging document which victim or victims served as the basis for the charge in the\nstate indictment. Belohlavek explained to OPR that the charge did not list specific victims so that she could go forward\nat trial with whichever victim or victims might be available and willing to testify at that time.\n27 The Petite policy is a set of <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> used by federal prosecutors when considering whether to pursue federal\ncharges for defendants previously prosecuted for state or local offenses. The Constitution does not prohibit the federal\ngovernment from prosecuting defendants who have been charged, acquited, or convicted on state charges based on\nthe same criminal conduct. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing principle that the prohibition\nagainst double jeopardy does not apply to prosecutions brought by different sovereigns. See, e.g., Gamble v. United\nStates, 587 U.S. ___, l39 S. Ct. l96o, l966-67 (2ol9) (and cases cited therein); Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S.\nl87, l95 (l959) (and cases cited therein); and United States v. Lanza, 26o U.S. 377, 382 (l922). Nonetheless, to\nbeter promote the efficient use of criminal justice resources, the Department developed policies in l959 and l96o to\nguide federal prosecutors in the use of their charging discretion. See Chapter Two, Part Two, Section IT.A.2, for a\nmore detailed discussion of the Petite policy.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4344", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004346.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 49 of 349\nalso informed Sloman and Lourie that the FBI was re-interviewing victims who had given taped\nstatements to the PBPD, to ensure their stories “have not changed,” and that “[a]ny discrepancies\nwill be noted and considered.” She conceded that “[g]eting them to tell their stories in front of a\njury at trial may be much harder,” but expressed confidence that the two key victims “will stay the\ncourse.” She acknouledged that the case “needs to be rock solid.”\n\nThe case agent told OPR that in this initial stage of the investigation, the FBI “partnered\nup very well” with the USAO. She recalled that there was litle higher-level management oversight\neither from the FBI or the USAO, and “‘we were alloued to do what we needed to do to get our\njob done.” This included continuing to identify, locate, and interview victims and Epstein\nemployees, and obtaining records relating to Epstein’s travel, communications, and financial\ntransactions. The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”\n\n5. October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.*+ Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\n22 Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\n3 Chapter One, Section IIIB of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to... change anything.”\n\nam Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nU.S. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4346", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004353.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 56 of 349\n\nLourie folloued up his email to Villafafia with one to Menchel, in which Lourie reiterated\nthe potential benefits of a pre-indictment plea, explaining that he and Villafafia believed “the best\nthing to do is charge Epstein by complaint, assuming we decide to charge him. ... The\n[sentencing] <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> will be in the 2o year range, so we would need to plead him to one or two\nconspiracies to cap him and there is no telling if a judge would go for that once we indict.””\nMenchel responded that he and Acosta would read the prosecution memorandum and “[w]e can\ndiscuss after that.”\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia sent Lourie an email, which Lourie forwarded to Menchel,\nexplaining that a “conservative calculation” of Epstein’s potential sentencing exposure under the\nU.S. Sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> would be l68 to 2lo months, and that in her view, the facts warranted\nan upward departure from that range. Villafafia told OPR that although Lourie proposed some\nchanges to the draft indictment, at that point no one had told her that the evidence was insufficient\nto support the proposed charges or that the office did not want to go forward with the case.\n\nIn an email to Acosta and Menchel on May ll, 2oo7, Lourie recommended charging\nEpstein by complaint and seeking a pre-indictment plea:\n\nMy current thoughts are that we should charge him. Not sure that I\nagree with the charging strategy as it is nou, but at this point I think\nwe only need to get on the same page as to whether the statutes cover\nthe conduct and whether the conduct is the type we should charge.\nI think the answer to both is yes, although there is some risk on some\nof the statutes as this is uncharted territory to some degree. We can\ndecide later what the [charging document] should look like precisely\nand which victims should be charged.\n\nI also think if we choose to go forward, we should start with a\ncomplaint, arrest him, detain him . . . and then try to see if he wants\na pre-indictment resolution. That would give us more control [over]\na plea than if we indict him and need the court’s approval to dismiss\ncounts. We will need to cap him with conspiracy counts to make a\nplea atractive and the court could give us a hard time with that if we\ntry to dismiss indicted counts.\n\nAlthough her supervisors were communicating among themselves about the case, Villafafia\nwas unaware of those discussions and was frustrated that she was not receiving more feedback.\nShe continued preparing to charge Epstein. Two weeks after submiting the prosecution\nmemorandum, on May l4, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Lourie and Menchel by email that Epstein\nwas flying to New Jersey from the Virgin Islands, and she asked whether she could file charges\nthe next day. Menchel responded that “[y]ou will not have approval to go forward tomorrou,”\nand explained that Acosta “has your [prosecution] memo,” but was at an out-of-toun conference,\nadding, “This is obviously a very significant case and [A]lex wants to take his time making sure\n43 Lourie told OPR that he was referring to one or two counts of conspiracy under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, the general\n“omnibus” federal conspiracy statute that carries a maximum sentence of five years.\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4353", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004363.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 66 of 349\nI do think it’s important to look back on this, and try to be in the\nshoes of the thought process in 2oo6 and ’o7 when trafficking\nprosecutions were fairly new, when . . . more so than today, some\njurors may have looked at this as prostitution, and . . . [a] judge’s\ntolerance for victim shaming may have . . . caused more hesitation\non the part of victims... .©\nFinally, Acosta told OPR that a state-based resolution offered more flexibility in fashioning\na sentence, because he believed prosecutors would have difficulty persuading a federal district\ncourt in the Southern District of Florida to approve a federal plea for a stipulated binding sentence\nthat differed from the otherwise applicable federal sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> range. °*\nIn summarizing his thinking at the time, Acosta told OPR,\nThe way the mater came to the office was, the state wasn’t doing\nenough. It didn’t provide for prison time. It didn’t provide for\nregistration, and then you had the restitution issue. There were legal\nissues ... . There were witness issues. And... we could go to trial\n...and we may or may not prevail. Alternatively, we could look at\na pre-indictment resolution, and at various points, the office went\nback and forth between a federal pre-indictment resolution, and a\nstate pre-indictment resolution.\nAcosta told OPR that, in the end, “there was a preference for deferring to the state” because, in\npart, the facts of the Epstein case at the time appeared to constitute solicitation or prostitution\nrather than trafficking, and a federal prosecution would be “uncharted territory.” Acosta explained\nthat he did not view it as problematic to defer resolution of the case to the state, although as the\nEpstein case played out, the federal role became “more intrusive” than he had anticipated, because\nthe defense tried to get the state to “circumvent and undermine” the outcome.\nAtorney’s Office could have proceeded against Epstein by way of an information, but decided to go into the grand\njury because the State Atorney’s Office “didn’t like the case” and wanted “political cover” for declining the case or\nproceeding on a lesser charge.\n3 Menchel told OPR, houever, that the federal judges in West Palm Beach were highly regarded and were\ngenerally viewed as “pro-prosecution.”\not Acosta said that “dismissing a number of counts and then doing a [R]ule ll is not something that [South\nFlorida federal district] judges tend to do.” Other subjects also told OPR that the federal judges in the Southern District\nof Florida were generally considered averse to pleas that bound them on sentencing, commonly referred to as “Rule\nll(c) pleas.”\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) allous the parties to agree on a specific sentence as part of\na plea agreement. The court is required to impose that sentence if the court accepts the plea agreement; if the court\ndoes not accept the agreed upon plea and sentence, the agreement is void. Villafafia told OPR that Rule ll(c) pleas\nwere “uncommon” in the Southern District of Florida, as the “judges do not like to be told . . . what sentence to\nimpose.” Menchel similarly told OPR that the USAO viewed federal judges in the Southern District of Florida as\naverse to Rule ll(c) pleas, although Menchel had negotiated such pleas. Villafafia told OPR that she had never offered\na Rule ll(c) plea in any of her cases and had no experience with such pleas.\n39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4363", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004364.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 67 of 349\nMenchel could not recall who initially suggested a state plea, but noted to OPR that his\n\noun “emails . .. make clear that this course of action was ultimately decided by Alex Acosta.” He\nreferenced, among others, his May l4, 2oo7 email to Villafafia informing her that Acosta was\ndeciding hou he wanted to handle the case. Menchel surmised that a state resolution accomplished\ntwo things that Acosta viewed as important: first, it resolved any Petite policy concerns, and\nsecond, it afforded more flexibility in sentencing than a federal plea would have alloued. Menchel\ntold OPR that the state plea proposal did not reflect any minimization of Epstein’s conduct and\nthat any state plea would have been to an offense that required sexual offender registration. He\ntold OPR, “I don’t think anybody sat around and said, you knou, it’s not that big a deal. That was\nnot the reaction that I think anybody had from the federal side of this case.” Rather, Menchel said,\n“The concern was if we charge him [as proposed], there’s going to be a trial.”\n\nDe July 2oo7: Villafaia and Menchel Disagree about the Proposed State\n\nResolution\nVillafafia told OPR that she was angry when she received Menchel’s July email explaining\n\nthat he had proposed to Sanchez resolving the federal investigation through a state plea. In\nVillafafia’s view, the proposed state resolution “didn’t make any sense” and “did not correspond”\nto Department policy requiring that a plea offer reflect “the most serious readily provable\noffense.”® In her view, a plea to a state charge “obviously” would not satisfy this policy. Villafafia\nalso told OPR that in her view, the USAM required the USAO to confer with the investigative\nagency about plea negotiations, and Villafafia did not believe the FBI would be in favor of a state\nplea. Villafafia also believed the CVRA required atorneys for the government to confer with\nvictims before making a plea offer, but the victims had not been consulted about this proposal.\nVillafafia told OPR she had met with some of the victims during the course of the investigation\nwho had negative impressions of the State Atorney’s Office, and she believed that “sending them\nback to the State Atorney’s Office was not something” those victims would support.\n& This policy was set forth in a September 22, 2oo3 memorandum from then Atorney General John Ashcroft\nregarding “Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and Sentencing”\n(knoun as the “Ashcroft Memo”), which provided, in pertinent part:\n\n[I]n all federal criminal cases, federal prosecutors must charge and pursue the\n\nmost serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts\n\nof the case, except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, United States\n\nAtorney, or designated supervisory atorney in the limited circumstances\n\ndescribed belou. The most serious offense or offenses are those that generate the\n\nmost substantial sentence under the Sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, unless a mandatory\n\nminimum sentence or count requiring a consecutive sentence would generate a\n\nlonger sentence. A charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor has a good\n\nfaith doubt, for legal or evidentiary reasons, as to the Government’s ability readily\n\nto prove a charge at trial. Thus, charges should not be filed simply to exert\n\nleverage to induce a plea. Once filed, the most serious readily provable charges\n\nmay not be dismissed except to the extent permited [elsewhere in this\n\nMemorandum].\nSee also Chapter Two, Part Two, Section II.B.l.\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4364", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004373.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 76 of 349\nVillafafia, Menchel left the meeting after almost no discussion, leaving Villafafia “shocked and\nstunned.”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall the July 26, 2oo7 meeting. Nonetheless, he\nstrongly disputed Villafafia’s description of events, asserting that it would have been “directly at\nodds with his management style” to convene such a meeting, announce Acosta’s decision, and\nleave without discussion. Acosta told OPR that he had “decided and endorsed this resolution at\nsome point,” but he did not recall being aware that Menchel was going to announce the decision\nat the July 26 meeting; in addition, although Acosta did not recall the circumstances of Menchel’s\nrelaying of that decision, he said it “would have been consistent with” his decision for Menchel to\ndo so. Neither Sloman nor Lourie recalled the meeting. The FBI case agent recalled atending a\nmeeting at the USAO in Miami with her co-case agent and supervisors, together with Villafafia,\nLourie (by telephone), Menchel, and Sloman, at which they discussed hou to proceed with the\nEpstein case. According to the case agent, at this meeting the FBI insisted that Epstein be\nregistered for life as a sexual offender, and the co-case agent advocated for waiting until the court\nhad ruled on the USAO’s ability to obtain Epstein’s computer equipment.\n\nRegardless of exactly hou Acosta’s decision regarding the two-year term was\ncommunicated to Villafafia and the FBI agents, and regardless of who initially proposed the\nspecific term, the record shous that Acosta ultimately made the decision to offer Epstein a\nresolution that included a two-year term of imprisonment, as he acknouledged.”\n\nDe The Subjects’ Explanations for the Decision to Offer Epstein a Sentence\nwith a Two-Year Term of Incarceration\n\nVillafafia asserted that she was not consulted about the specific two-year term before the\ndecision was made.” Villafafia told OPR that she had worked hard to develop a strong case, and\nnone of her supervisors had identified to her any specific problem with the case that, in her view,\nexplained the decision to extend an offer for a two-year sentence. Villafafia also told OPR that\nMenchel provided no explanation for this decision during the July 26, 2oo7 meeting, and Villafafia\ndid not ask for an explanation because she accepted his statement that it was Acosta’s decision.\nVillafafia described the proposal as “random,” and told OPR, “[W]e’re all [sentencing] <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>\npeople, so 24 months just makes no sense in the context of the <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>. There’s no way to get\nto 24 months with this set of offenses.”*°\nl8 OPR notes that Villafafia did not appear hesitant to send emails to her supervisors seting forth her views and\nobjections, and there is no reference before this meeting in any of her emails indicating that a decision had been made\nto offer a two-year term of incarceration. Therefore, given that a meeting had been arranged involving Menchel and\nVillafafia, and possibly most of the other primary USAO and FBI participants, it seems logical that Acosta made a\ndecision to resolve the case with a two-year state plea not long before the meeting.\n\n2 OPR found no evidence in the documentary record indicating that Villafafia had knouledge of Acosta’s\ndecision or the two-year term before the July 26, 2oo7 meeting at which she said she learned of it.\n8o From the time the U.S. Sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> went into effect in l987, they have been the mechanism for\ncalculating federal criminal sentences.

He opined to OPR that the decision was likely based on an\nassessment by Menchel and Lourie of the litigation risks presented by the case.*! Sloman added\nthat he did not knou hou a two-year sentence might have related to specific charges or to either\nstate or federal sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>. Lourie likewise told OPR he did not recall hou the two-year\nterm was decided upon, or by whom, but he speculated that it may have been presented by the\ndefense as the most Epstein would accept, and that the decision would have been reached by\nAcosta follouing “extended consideration, research, and discussion,” among Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. *”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall discussing a two-year plea deal with Acosta or\nwho reached the decision that two years was an appropriate sentence. Menchel also told OPR,\nhouever, that he recalled believing that if the USAO had filed the contemplated federal charges,\nEpstein would have felt he had “‘nothing to lose” and “undoubtedly” would have chosen to take\nthe case to trial. Menchel recalled believing there was a real risk that the USAO might lose at trial,\nand in so doing, might cause more trauma to the victims, particularly those who were reluctant to\ntestify. Menchel told OPR that he did not believe that anyone at the time looked at two years “as\na fair result in terms of the conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not\nif we took this case to trial, would we risk losing everything,” and “if we . . . felt we could have\ngoten more time, we would have, without having to press it to the trial.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “I had decided and endorsed” the two-year resolution “at some\npoint,” and that it resulted from “back and forth” discussion “over the course of some days or a\nweek or two.” As noted earlier in this Report, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in this case merely\nas a “backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he explained to OPR was “a polite way of saying[,\n‘Jencouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]”*? Acosta said that he understood two years’\nimprisonment to have represented the sentence Epstein faced under one of the original charges the\nPBPD was considering at the outset of the state investigation.** Acosta also told OPR that he\n\nthe atorney for the government has a continuing obligation to assist the court in\n\nits determination of the sentence to be imposed. The prosecutor must be familiar\n\nwith the <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> generally and with the specific guideline provisions applicable\n\nto his or her case. In discharging these duties, the atorney for the government\n\nshould .. . endeavor to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information\n\nupon which the sentencing decisions will be based.\na In Sloman’s view, Menchel and Lourie were “two of the finest trial lawyers” in the USAO.\nae Lourie noted that Sloman and Menchel were “two extraordinarily experienced people in [Acosta’s] front\noffice who had tried . . . gobs and gobs of cases.”\n83 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney asserted that OPR’s use of Acosta’s quote, “a litle\nbit more,” “unfairly minimized” Acosta’s and the USAO’s efforts to achieve justice in this case. Acosta’s atorney\nalso asserted that the phrase was “clearly soft-spoken understatement,” that the terms obtained were “substantially\nmore onerous than the state’s alternative resolution,” and that Acosta was “clearly declining the invitation to take the\nState to task and soft-pedaling an obvious distinction.”\n\n84 OPR examined this assertion and was unable to verify that the proposed two-year term of imprisonment\ncorresponded with the charges that the PBPD considered at the outset of the state investigation or with the charge in\n5o\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4374", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004375.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 78 of 349\nunderstood that the PBPD would not have asked the FBI to investigate Epstein if the state had\npursued the appropriate charges. In other words, in Acosta’s view, “[T]his was, rightly or wrongly,\nan analysis that distinguished between what is necessary to prevent manifest injustice, versus what\nis the appropriate federal outcome to that.” Acosta told OPR that he believed he had discussed his\nconcerns about the case with Lourie, Sloman, or Menchel, although he could not recall any specific\nconversation with them.\n\nE. Villafaia Drafts a “Term Sheet” Listing the Requirements of a Potential\n\nAgreement with the Defense\n\nA meeting with defense counsel was scheduled for Tuesday, July 3l, 2oo7. Villafafia told\nOPR that between July 26 and July 3o, 2oo7, she had “some sort of discussion” with her\nsupervisors that resulted in her creation of a “term sheet” identifying the proposed terms for\nresolving the federal investigation through state charges. Sometime during that period, Villafafia\nleft a voicemail message for Menchel. During their OPR interviews, neither Villafafia nor\nMenchel could recall what Villafafia said in that message. On July 3o, 2oo7, Menchel emailed\nVillafafia:\n\nI received your voicemail this morning. I don’t see any reason to\nchange our approach. I think telling them that unless the state\nresolves this in a way that appropriately vindicates our interests and\nthe interests of the victims, we will seek [federal charges] conveys\nthat we are serious. While Lilly [Sanchez] has represented in the\npast that this would likely not happen, I never conveyed it in quite\nthese terms before. In any event, this is the course of action that the\nUS Atorney feels comfortable taking at this juncture.\n\nThe follouing day, July 3l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed a one-page “Terms of Epstein\nNon-Prosecution Agreement” to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie. Villafafia told OPR she had never\nbefore seen or heard of a non-prosecution agreement and that it was a concept “completely foreign”\nto her.®° Villafafia told OPR that the idea of styling the two-year state plea agreement with Epstein\nthe state indictment. OPR considered various potential state charges involving various numbers of victims and found\nno obvious reasonable state sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> calculation that would have resulted in a two-year sentence.\n\n8 Deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements were standard, though infrequently used, vehicles for\nresolving certain federal criminal cases against corporate entities. A 2oo8 Departmental memorandum explained:\n\nThe terms “deferred prosecution agreement” and “non-prosecution agreement”\n\nhave often been used loosely by prosecutors, defense counsel, courts and\n\ncommentators. As the terms are used in these Principles [of Federal Prosecution\n\nof Business Organizations], a deferred prosecution agreement is typically\n\npredicated upon the filing of a formal charging document by the government, and\n\nthe agreement is filed with the appropriate court. In the non-prosecution\n\nagreement context, formal charges are not filed and the agreement is maintained\n\nby the parties rather than being filed with a court. Clear and consistent use of\n\nthese terms will enable the Department to more effectively identify and share best\n\npractices and to track the use of such agreements. These Principles do not apply\n\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4375", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004378.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 8l of 349\nthe period of imprisonment, because the USAO failed to hold firm to its proposal of “at least two\nyears in prison.” The USAO did, houever, consistently reject defense proposals to change other\nterms, particularly the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.\n\nA.

A few days after the meeting,\nVillafafia emailed Menchel, stating that she had “figured out a way to do a federal plea with a 2-l/2\nyear cap.”\n\nAlthough Acosta had authorized a plea to state charges, emails and other correspondence\nshou that during the negotiations, the parties also considered structuring a plea around federal\ney Villafafia was the only witness with whom OPR spoke who had a substantive memory of this meeting.\n\n88 According to the Florida Department of Corrections fact sheet for defendants subjected to community control,\n\nThe Community Control supervision program was created as a diversion to\n\nincarceration or imprisonment; therefore it is an intensive supervision program\n\nwhere you are confined to your home unless you are working, atending school,\n\nperforming public service hours, participating in treatment or another special\n\nactivity that has been approved in advance by your officer.

We did not.” Villafafia anticipated there would be ways to “manipulate” a state\nsentence and the USAO would be “giving up all control,” and she told OPR that she discussed this concern with\nLourie, although she could not recall when that discussion occurred.\n\n54\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4378", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004389.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 92 of 349\n\nVillafafia told OPR that during the meeting, the group discussed the draft NPA, but she did\nnot think they gave a copy to Krischer and Belohlavek.

Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie, the other supervisor, and she made clear during the\nmeeting that they expected Epstein to be incarcerated 24 hours a day, seven days a week, during\nthe entirety of his sentence, and they did not “particularly care” whether it was in a state or local\nfacility. Belohlavek explained to OPR that in order for Epstein to serve his time in a county\nfacility, rather than state prison, his sentence on each charge could be no more than l2 months, so\nthat, for example, consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months—totaling l8 months—could be\nserved in the county jail. Villafafia told OPR:\n\nOur thing was incarceration 24 hours a day. So during this meeting,\n\nI remember [the defense] talking about .. .a one year count folloued\n\nby a six-month count . . . that [Epstein] could serve them back to\n\nback but at the county jail, rather than having to go to a state facility.\n\nBut then I said, “But if you do that, it’s still going to have to be round\n\nthe clock incarceration.” And Barry Krischer said yes. And [he]\n\nsaid that to avoid [Epstein being extorted while incarcerated], he\n\nwould be kept in solitary confinement.\nVillafafia did not recall whether she and Lourie agreed to an l8-month sentence during that\nmeeting, but she told OPR that in her view, allouing Epstein to serve his sentence in the county\njail was not a “concession” because he would be incarcerated regardless.\n\nNeither Lourie nor the other USAO supervisor present could recall any substantive details\nof the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and Krischer and Belohlavek told OPR they did not remember\nthe meeting at all. Krischer did, houever, recall that he was “not offended at all” when he learned\nof the proposed federal resolution, requiring Epstein to plead to both the pending state indictment\nand an additional charge requiring sexual offender registration, explaining to OPR that Epstein\n“was going to plead guilty to my indictment, we were going to add an additional charge, he was\nlo6 Later, the defense would claim that they had mistakenly understood that the selected charge would not\ninvolve sexual offender registration.\n\nlo7 As noted belou, a contemporaneous email indicates that shortly after the meeting, Lourie and Villafafia spoke\nwith Acosta and Sloman, who concurred with the agreement.\n65\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4389", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004396.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 99 of 349\nwe go that route, would you intend to make the deferred [sic] prosecution agreement public?”\nVillafafia replied that while a federal plea agreement would be part of the court file and publicly\naccessible, the NPA “would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would remain part\nof our case file. It probably would be subject to a FOIA [Freedom of Information Act] request,\nbut it is not something that we would distribute without compulsory process.”!'!® Villafafia told\nOPR that she believed Epstein did not want the NPA to be made public because he “did not want\npeople to believe him to have commited a variety of crimes.” As she explained to OPR, Villafafia\nbelieved the NPA did not need to be disclosed in its entirety, but she anticipated notifying the\nvictims about the NPA provisions relating to their ability to recover damages.\nE. The Parties Appear to Reach Agreement on a Plea to Federal Charges\nNegotiations continued the next day, Tuesday, September l8, 2oo7. Responding to\n\nVillafafia’s revised draft of the NPA, Lefkouitz suggested that Epstein plead to one federal charge\nwith a l2-month sentence, folloued by one year of supervised release with a requirement for home\ndetention and two years of state probation, with the first six months of the state sentence to be\nserved under community control. Villafafia replied, “I knou that the U.S. Atorney will not go\nbelou l8 months of prison/jail time (and I would strongly oppose the suggestion).” Shortly\nthereafter, Villafafia emailed Acosta, Lourie, and the incoming West Palm Beach manager:\n\nHi all — I think that we may be near the end of our negotiations with\n\nMr. Epstein, and not because we have reached a resolution. As I\n\nmentioned yesterday, I spent about l2 hours over the weekend\n\ndrafting Informations, changing plea agreements, and writing\n\nfactual proffers. I was supposed to receive a draft agreement from\n\nthem yesterday, which never arrived. At that time, they were\n\nleaning touards pleading only to state charges and doing all of the\n\ntime in state custody.\n\nLate last night I talked to Jay Lefkouitz who asked about Epstein\n\npleading to two twelve-month federal charges with half of his jail\n\ntime being spent in home confinement pursuant to the <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>. I\n\ntold him that I had no objection to that approach but, in the interest\n\nof full disclosure, I did not believe that Mr. Epstein would be eligible\n\nbecause he will not be in Zone A or B.'!’ This morning Jay\n\nLefkouitz called and said that I was correct but, if we could get\n\nMr. Epstein doun to l4 months, then he thought he would be\n\neligible.\n\nMy response: have him plead to two separate Informations.

When [Epstein] gets out, he has to plead to state\noffenses, including against minor, registrable, and then take one year house arrest/community\nconfinement.” By reply email, Villafafia asked Lourie to call her, but there is no record of whether\nthey spoke.\n\nF. Defense Counsel Offers New Proposals Substantially Changing the Terms of\n\nthe Federal Plea Agreement, which the USAO Rejects\n\nApproximately an hour after Lourie’s email reporting the deal he had reached with\nLefkouitz, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a revised draft plea agreement. Despite the agreement Lourie\nbelieved he and Lefkouitz had reached that morning, Lefkouitz’s proposal would have resulted\nin a l6-month federal sentence folloued by 8 months of supervised release served in the form of\nhome detention. Lefkouitz also inserted a statement in his proposal explicitly prohibiting the\nUSAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration authorities to institute immigration\nproceedings against two of Epstein’s female assistants.\n\nVillafafia circulated the defense’s proposed plea agreement to Lourie and two other\nsupervisors, and expressed frustration that the new defense version incorporated terms that were\n“completely different from what Jay just told Andy they would agree to.” Villafafia also pointed\nout that the defense “wants us to recommend an improper calculation” of the sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>\nll8 The manager told OPR that he probably meant this as a joke because in his view the continued back-and-\nforth communications with defense counsel “was ridiculous,” and the only way to “get this deal done” might be to\nhave a direct conversation with Epstein.\n\n73\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4397", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004446.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l49 of 349\n\nSome offenses, even though in violation of Federal law, are of\n\nparticularly strong interest to the authorities of the state or local\n\njurisdiction in which they occur, either because of the nature of the\n\noffense, the identity of the offender or victim, the fact that the\n\ninvestigation was conducted primarily by state or local\n\ninvestigators, or some other circumstance.

USAM § 9-27.27o.\n\n2. USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°? The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist. The prerequisites are as follous:\n\n(l) The mater must involve a substantial federal interest. The determination whether\n\na substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis. Maters\nl92 See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22, 27-29 (l977); Petite v.

The Ashcroft Memo cautioned\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“particularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy.

U.S. Atorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.?”\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. II,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.’’).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7* A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o5 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v.

See USAM §§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.7°? Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o8 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\nCircumstances,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional circumstances with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an Assistant Atorney General, United States Atorney, or designated\n\nsupervisory atorney. This exception recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system. For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office. Houever, such case-by-case\n\nexceptions should be rare; otherwise the goals of fairness and equity will be\n\njeopardized.\nAshcroft Memo at § I.B.6.

In\nAcosta’s view, “the federal responsibility” in this unique situation was merely to serve as a “‘back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”*4’ Acosta told OPR\nthat he understood the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s atention if the State\nAtorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration. Acosta therefore decided that\nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein\nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.\n\nAcosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated references to a\n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used\nin the Petite policy to define the circumstances in which the federal government may proceed with\na criminal case after a completed state prosecution. Nothing in the Petite policy, houever, requires\nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a completed state\nprosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense. The goal of the Petite\npolicy is to prevent multiple prosecutions for the same offense, not to compel the federal\ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials\ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions\nregarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case. Acosta told OPR that “there are any\nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state\ncharges are substantially less and different, and .. . the federal government . . . stands aside and\nlets the state proceed.” The fact that the federal government can allou the state to proceed with a\nprosecution, houever, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in\na mater in which a distinct and important federal interest exists. Indeed, the State Atorney told\nOPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators,\ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”\n\nEpstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>.7**\nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily\nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a litle bit more” does not approach\nthat standard. In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent\nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,”\nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from\nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to\nad Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n248 Villafafia estimated that the applicable sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> range was l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment.\nl72\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4496", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004504.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o7 of 349\n“I’m reconstructing memories of... l2 years ago. I can speculate that at some point, the mater\ncame up, and I or someone else said . .. what would the original charges have likely brought? And\nsomeone said this amount.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall who initially proposed this\nmethod, but he believed that it likely did not result from a single specific discussion but rather\nfrom conversations over a course of time. Acosta could not recall specifically with whom he had\nthese discussions, other than that it would have been Lourie, Menchel, or Sloman. Villafafia was\nnot asked for her views on a two-year sentence, and she had no input into the decision before it\nwas made. Villafafia told OPR that she examined the state statutes and could not validate that a\nstate charge would have resulted in a 24-month sentence. OPR also examined applicable state\nstatutes and the Florida sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>, but could not confirm that Epstein was, in fact,\nfacing a potential two-year sentence under charges contemplated by the PBPD.\n\nOn the other hand, during his OPR interview, Lourie “guess[ed]” that “somehou the\ndefense conveyed . . . we’re going to trial if it’s more than two years.” Menchel similarly told\nOPR that he did not knou hou the two year sentence was derived, but “obviously it was a number\nthat the office felt was palatable enough that [Epstein] would take” it. Sloman told OPR that he\nhad no idea hou the two-year sentence proposal was reached.\n\nThe contemporaneous documentary record, houever, provides no indication that Epstein’s\nteam proposed a two-year sentence of incarceration or initially suggested, before the USAO made\nits offer, that Epstein would accept a two-year term of incarceration. As late as July 25, 2oo7—\nonly days before the USAO provided the term sheet to defense counsel—Epstein’s counsel\nsubmited a leter to the USAO arguing that the federal government should not prosecute Epstein\nat all. Furthermore, after the initial “term sheet” was presented and negotiations for the NPA\nprogressed, Epstein’s team continued to strongly press for less or no time in jail.\n\nThe USAO had other charging and sentencing options available to it. The most obvious\nalternative to the two-year sentence proposal was to offer Epstein a plea to a federal offense that\ncarried a harsher sentence. If federally charged, Epstein was facing a substantial sentence under\nthe federal sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>, l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment. Houever, it is unlikely that\nhe would have agreed to a plea that required a <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> sentence, even one at the louer end of\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues had been concerned that Epstein\nwould opt to go to trial if charged and presented with the option of pleading to a <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>\nsentence, and as previously discussed, there were both evidentiary and legal risks atendant upon\na trial in this case. If federally charged, Epstein’s sentencing exposure could have been managed\nby offering him a plea under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c) for a stipulated sentence,\nwhich requires judicial approval. Acosta rejected this idea, houever, apparently because of a\nperception that the federal district courts in the Southern District of Florida did not view Rule ll(c)\npleas favorably and might refuse to accept such a plea and thus limit the USAO’s options.\n\nAnother alternative was to offer Epstein a plea to conspiracy, a federal charge that carried\na maximum five-year sentence. Shortly after Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum\nto her supervisors, Lourie recommended to Acosta charging Epstein by criminal complaint and\noffering a plea to conspiracy “to make a plea atractive.” Similarly, before learning that Menchel\nhad already discussed a state-based resolution with Epstein’s counsel, Villafafia had considered\noffering Epstein a plea to one count of conspiracy and a substantive charge, to be served\nconcurrently with any sentence he might receive separately as a result of the state’s outstanding\n\nl8o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004505.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o8 of 349\nindictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution\nthat ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would\nbe sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\ntraditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis. In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004514.jpg": ". . . nm: .\n> Timeline of Key Events for Crime Victims’ Rights Act Analysis\na\n- Aug lo — FBI Dec 7 — Sloman tells July 7 —Jane Doe files an Additional Key Dates\n| begins interviewing Villafafia to “hold the emergency petition against\nvictims leter” re notification to the United States asserting\npa Santen acgeurdna Shad violations of the CVRA VG\nq plea hearing Marl? = Villasita : nits el\ncr BPRS carrer teres voliedee alte July 9 ~ USAO begins regarding CVRA\nte st ip ; : = = _ ang Dee ls aces sands atormeys for victims sending leters to victims\n—i ea ; a vena res 7 leter to Epstein’s counsel Mar-May — FBI concerning resolution of Oct 2oll = DOJ revises\nee ard ts advising USAO will defer Seana federal investigation AG <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>\nof the girls i ges tre eTe Tas interviews victims\nnotification of state piea\nto state officials May 29, 2ol5 —CVRA\n= Rigid tie Jan lo - FBI new rights\n6 =—— sends VNS leter i oe\n: to some victims Eeb2l, 2ol9 Dit Ct\n= US. violated the\na : Jul 6, 2ol9 — Epstein\n2oo6 2oo7 2oo8 | arrested on SDNY\n= Sept 6 — Villafafia e-mail to | ug lo, 2ol9 — Epstein\nJ Sloman raising victim Jan 3l-Feb | —FBI, Spin tie es “is\n8 consultation issue, which Villafada, and CEOS in custody\na) Sloman forwards to Acosta atlomey ilerview Viclins Sep l6, 2ol9 — Dist.

For\nexample, the first right grants a victim protection from “the accused,” not a suspect. Additionally,\nthe second, third, and fourth rights refer to “victim notification, and access to, public proceedings\ninvolving release, plea, sentencing or parole—none of which commence prior to the filing of a\ncomplaint.”\n\nB. 2oo5 Atorney General <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> for Victim and Witness Assistance\n\nIn May 2oo5, the Department updated its Atorney General <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> for Victim and\nWitness Assistance (2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>) to include the CVRA.”® The 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> specifically\ncited the CVRA requirement that agencies “engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution\nof crime shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded” their\nCVRA rights, which in 2oo5 encompassed the initial eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> provided detail regarding implementation of the Department’s CVRA\nduties and divided criminal cases into an “investigation stage,” a “prosecution stage,” and a\n“corrections stage.” The individuals responsible for notifying crime victims of their CVRA rights\nvaried depending on the stage of the proceedings.\n\nDuring the “investigation stage” of cases in which the FBI was the investigating agency,\nthe Special Agent in Charge was responsible for identifying the victims “[a]t the earliest\nopportunity after the detection of a crime” and notifying them of their rights under the CVRA and\nservices available under the VRRA and other federal statutes.\n\n[D]uring the investigative stage, [the Department] mandates\n\ncompliance with the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act, 42 U.S.C\n\n§ lo6o7, which requires federal officials to, among other things,\n\nidentify victims, protect victims, arrange for victims to receive\n\nreasonable protection from suspected offenders, and provide\nThe Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4 (Dec. l7, 2olo) (““OLC\nAvailability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo)”) and available at htps://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/ole/\nopinions/2olo/l2/3 l/availability-crime-victims-rights.pdf. “That [2oo5] informal guidance did not foreclose the\npossibility that other definitions would also be reasonable.” OLC Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo) at l.\n269 The 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> are set forth in relevant part in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section II of this Report. The\nDepartment promulgated the <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> in response to a congressional directive in a predecessor statute to the CVRA,\nwhich instructed the Atorney General to develop and implement such <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>. Victim and Witness Protection Act,\nPub. L. No. 97-29l, § 6, 96 Stat. l248 (l982). The 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> were superseded in October 2oll, as explained\nbelou.\n\nl93\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45l7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004518.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 22l of 349\ninformation about available services for victims. Therefore, even\nthough [the Department] may not afford CVRA rights to victims if\ncharges have not been filed in their cases, the [D]epartment may\nprovide certain services to victims that may serve the same function\nas some CVRA rights.””°\n\nThe 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> stated that the “prosecution stage” of the case began when “charges\nare filed and continue[d] through postsentencing legal proceedings.” The “U.S. Atorney in whose\ndistrict the prosecution is pending” was responsible for making “best efforts to see that crime\nvictims are notified” of their rights under the CVRA.\n\nDuring the prosecution stage, the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> required the U.S. Atorney, or a\ndesignee, to notify crime victims of case events, such as the filing of charges; the release of an\noffender; the schedule of court proceedings; the acceptance of a guilty plea or nolo contendere or\nrendering of a verdict; and any sentence imposed. The 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> required the responsible\nofficial to “provide the victim with reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding . . . that involves the crime against the victim.”\n\nThe 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult\nwith victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea\nnegotiations, and pretrial diversion. In particular, the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> required the responsible\nofficial to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views\nabout, prospective plea negotiations. Nevertheless, the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a conviction. Depending on the agency having custody of the defendant, the U.S.\nAtorney or other agencies were responsible for victim notifications during this stage.\n\nIV. USAO AND FBI VICTIM/WITNESS NOTIFICATION PRACTICE AT THE TIME\n\nOF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. USAO Training\n\nAs U.S. Atorney, Acosta disseminated the May 2oo5 updated <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> to USAO\npersonnel with a transmital memorandum dated February 27, 2oo6, stating that he expected each\nrecipient “to read and become familiar with the [2oo5] <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>.” Acosta noted in the\nmemorandum that the USAO had recently held an “all office training” addressing the 2oo5\n<span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> and that new USAO atorneys who missed the training were required to view a\nvideotaped version of the training “immediately.” Acosta further noted that the USAO’s\n27o GAO CVRA Awareness Report at 66.\n\nl94\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004519.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 222 of 349\nvictim/witness staff were “ready to assist you with the details of victim notification, and other\nareas for which United States Atorney[’]s Offices are nou explicitly responsible under the act.”\nThe USAO’s Victim Witness Program Coordinator told OPR that the USAO provided annual\nmandatory office-wide training on victim/witness issues and training for new employees.\n\nB. The Automated Victim Notification System\n\nBoth the FBI and the USAO manage contacts with crime victims through the Victim\nNotification System (VNS), an automated system maintained by the Executive Office for United\nStates Atorneys. The 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> mandated that “victim contact information and notice to\nvictims of events . . . shall, absent exceptional circumstances (such as cases involving juvenile or\nforeign victims), be conducted and maintained using VNS.” The VNS is separate from agency\ncase management systems maintained by the FBI and the USAO. Both the FBI and the USAO\nuse the VNS to generate form leters to victims at various points in the investigation and the\nprosecution of a criminal case. Although each form leter can be augmented to add some limited\nindividual mater-specific content, the leters contain specific language concerning the purpose of\nthe contact that cannot be removed (such as the arrest of the defendant or the scheduling of a\nsentencing hearing).?”!\n\nIn the usual course of a criminal case, the FBI collects victim contact information during\nthe investigation stage, which it stores in its case management system. The FBI’s Victim Specialist\nexports the victim information data from the FBI’s case management system into the VNS\ndatabase. Victim information stored in the VNS is linked to the investigation’s VNS case number.\nAt the time of the Epstein investigation, the FBI’s Victim Specialist could use the VNS to generate\nseven different form notification leters: (l) initial notification; (2) case is under investigation;\n(3) arrest of the defendant; (4) declination of prosecution; (5) other; (6) advice of victim rights;\nand (7) investigation closed.\n\nAfter a charging document has been filed and the “prosecution stage” begins, the USAO’s\nVictim Witness Specialist assumes responsibility for victim notification.*”” The USAO imports\ndata from its case management system into the VNS and links to the previously loaded FBI VNS\ndata. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist uses the VNS to generate form leters providing\nnotice of case events, such as charges filed; an arraignment; a proposed plea agreement; change of\nplea hearings; sentencing hearings; and the result of sentencing hearings.\neth US. Dept. of Justice Office of the Inspector General Audit Division Audit Report o8-o4, The Department of\nJustice’s Victim Notification System at 29 (Jan. 2oo8), available at htps://oig.justice.gov/reports/EOUSA/ao8o4/\nfinal.pdf. The 2oo8 audit identified concerns with the VNS templates, including that “VNS users . . . cannot alter the\nformat to ensure that it fits with the specific case for which it is being sent,” and many users had noted that “information\nin notifications became confusing and sometimes contradictory when various types of notifications were combined in\nthe same leter.”\n\n272 The FBI and the USAO have different titles for the individual who maintains victim contact: the FBI title is\n“Victim Specialist,” and the USAO title is “Victim Witness Specialist.”\nl95\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45l9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004520.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 223 of 349\n\nC. FBI Victim Notification Pamphlets\n\nThe 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> recommended that “victims be given a printed brochure or card that\nbriefly describes their rights and available services . . . and [contact information for] the victim-\nwitness coordinator or specialist....” At the time of the Epstein investigation, FBI agents\nnationwide routinely folloued a practice of providing victims with pamphlets entitled, “Help for\nVictims of Crime” and “The Department of Justice Victim Notification System.” The “Help for\nVictims of Crime” pamphlet contained a listing of the eight CVRA rights. The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview. The pamphlet entitled “The\nDepartment of Justice Victim Notification System” provided an overview of the VNS and\ninstructions on hou to access the system.\nV. THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim Notification Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\nSpecialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\nNotification Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.7”° Thereafter, the Victim Specialist\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”?”*4\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim Specialist\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\n2o8 These 3o were drawn from the PBPD investigative file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\ndesignated as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed.\n274 The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim Specialist] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights . . . and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim Specialist.”\n\nl96\nDOJ-OGR-oooo452o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004522.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 225 of 349\nIf you have additional questions which invalve this mater, please contact the office listed above.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim Specialist was preparing and sending FBI victim\nnotification leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t . . . have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\n<span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?”\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nat OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4522", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004523.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 226 of 349\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?7”\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.*’* Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing of a criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially receiving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\nant Villafaia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\nSpecialist who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\naus Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n\n279 Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [<span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\nl99\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4523", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004543.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 246 of 349\nhave “notified [the victims] that that was an all-encompassing plea, that that state court sentence\nwould also mean that the federal government was not proceeding.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he thought Acosta and Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Sigal Mandelker had agreed that the decision whether to notify the victims of the state\ncourt proceedings should be “left to the state.”*3 Mandelker, houever, had no memory of advising\nAcosta to defer the decision to make notifications to the State Atorney, and she noted that the\n“correspondence [OPR] provided to me from that time period” discussing such a decision\n“demonstrates that all of the referenced language came from Mr. Acosta and/or his team, and that\nI did not provide, suggest, or edit the language.” Sloman told OPR that he initially believed that\n“the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially because they had restitution rights\nunder § 2255”; but, his expectations changed after “there was an agreement made that we were\ngoing to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to decide hou the victims were going\nto be notified.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek told OPR that she did not at any time receive a victim\nlist from the USAO. She further said she did not receive any request from the USAO with regard\nto contacting the victims.\n\nIn response to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter, Lefkouitz asserted that the FBI should\nnot communicate with the victims, and that the state, not the USAO, should determine who can be\nheard at the sentencing hearing:\n\n[Y]our leter also suggests that our objection to your Office’s\n\nproposed victims notification leter was that the women identified\n\nas victims of federal crimes should not be notified of the state\n\nproceedings.

Additionally, it was and remains our position\n\nthat any notification should be by mail and that all proactive efforts\n\nby the FBI to have communications with the witnesses after the\n\nexecution of the Agreement should finally come to an end.

Lefkouitz argued that CVRA notification was not appropriate because\nthe Atorney General <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> defined “crime victim” as a person harmed as a result of an\noffense charged in federal district court, and Epstein had not been charged in federal court.\nNevertheless, Lefkouitz added that, despite their objection to CVRA notification, “[W]e do not\nobject (as we made clear in our leter last week) that some form of notice be given to the alleged\nvictims.” Lefkouitz requested both that the defense be given an opportunity to review any notice\nsent by the USAO, and that “any and all notices with respect to the alleged victims of state offenses\nshould be sent by the State Atorney rather than [the USAO],” and he agreed that the USAO\n“should defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding all maters with regard to those\nvictims and the state proceedings.”\n\nMonths later, in April 2oo8, Epstein’s atorneys complained in a leter to Mandelker that\nSloman and Villafafia commited professional misconduct by threatening to send a “highly\nimproper and unusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” victims.\n\nF. January — June 2oo8: While the Defense Presses Its Appeal to the Department\n\nin an Effort to Undo the NPA, the FBI and the USAO Continue Investigating\nEpstein\n\nAs described in Chapter Two of this Report, from the time the NPA was signed through\nthe end of June 2oo8, the defense employed various measures to delay, or avoid entirely,\nimplementation of the NPA. Ultimately, defense counsel’s advocacy resulted in the USAO’s\ndecision to have the federal case reviewed afresh. A review of the evidence was undertaken first\nby USAO Criminal Chief Robert Senior and then, briefly, by an experienced CEOS trial\natorney. A review of the case in light of the defense challenges was then conducted by CEOS\nChief Oosterban, in consultation with his staff and with Deputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal\nMandelker and Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher, and then by the Office of the Deputy\nAtorney General. Each review took weeks and delayed Epstein’s entry of his state guilty plea.\n\nAs set forth belou, during that time, Villafafia and the FBI continued investigating and\nworking touard potential federal charges.\n\nl. Villafafia Prepares to Contact Victims in Anticipation That Epstein\nWill Breach the NPA\n\nOn January 3, 2oo8, the local newspaper reported that Epstein’s plea conference in state\ncourt, at that point set for early January, had been rescheduled to March 2oo8, at which time he\nwould plead guilty to felony solicitation of prostitution, and that “in exchange” for the guilty plea,\n324 The 2ooo <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> were superseded by the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>.\n\n22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4544", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004552.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 255 of 349\ncamera memory cards seized by the PBPD in order to have them forensically examined for deleted\nimages that could contain child pornography.*”\n\nBy early April 2oo8, as the defense pursued its appeal to the Department’s Criminal\nDivision, Acosta predicted in an email to Villafafia and Sloman that federal charges against Epstein\nwere “more and more likely.” Villafafia asked Oosterban for help to “move this [Criminal\nDivision review] process along,” noting that the defense continued to undermine the government’s\ncase by deposing the victims “under the guise of ‘trial prep’ for the state case” and that the “agents\nand the victims” were “losing their patience.”\n\nOn April 24, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman and USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior\nasking whether she had the “green light” to file charges and raising the same concerns she had\nexpressed to Oosterban. Villafafia further cautioned that, although she was planning to file\ncharges on May 6, if that was not going to happen, “then we all need to meet with the victims, the\nagents, and the police officers to decide hou the case will be resolved and to provide them with an\nexplanation for the delay.” Because the Department’s Criminal Division did not conclude its\nreview of Epstein’s appeal by May 6, houever, Villafafia did not file charges that day.\n\nVill. USAO SUPERVISORS CONSIDER CVRA OBLIGATIONS IN AN UNRELATED\n\nMATTER AND IN LIGHT OF A NEW FIFTH CIRCUIT OPINION\n\nDuring the period after the NPA was signed, and before Epstein complied with the NPA\nby entering his state guilty pleas, the USAO supervisors were explicitly made aware of a conflict\nbetween the Department’s position that CVRA’s victims’ rights atached upon the filing of a\ncriminal charge and a new federal appellate ruling to the contrary. The contemporaneous\ncommunications confirm that in 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman were aware of the Department’s policy\nregarding the issue.\n\nUnrelated to the Epstein investigation, on April l8, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman received a\ncitizen complaint from an atorney who requested to meet with them regarding his belief that the\nFlorida Bar had violated his First Amendment rights. The atorney asserted that the CVRA\nguaranteed him “an absolute right to meet” with USAO officials because he believed that he was\nthe victim of a federal crime. Acosta forwarded the message to the USAO Appellate Division\nChief, who informed Acosta and Sloman that, according to the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, “our obligations\nunder [the CVRA] are not triggered until charges are filed.” On April 24, 2oo8, the Appellate\nDivision Chief emailed Acosta and Sloman, stating that she had “confirmed with DOJ that [her]\nreading of [the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>] is correct and that our obligations under [the CVRA] are not\ntriggered until a case is filed.’\n\nOn May 7, 2oo8, the Appellate Division Chief sent Acosta and Sloman a copy of a U.S.\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit opinion issued that day, Jn re Dean, holding that a victim’s\noe The forensic examination did not locate useful evidence on the memory cards.\n\n343 The Appellate Division Chief advised Acosta that Acosta could inform the complainant that, prior to the\ninitiation of charges, the investigating agency was responsible for carrying out the Department’s statutory obligations\nto the victim.\n228\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4552", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004553.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 256 of 349\nCVRA rights atach prior to the filing of criminal charges.*4+ The Appellate Division Chief noted\nthat, although the holding conflicted with the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, the “court’s opinion makes sense.”\n\nDean involved a federal prosecution arising from a 2oo5 explosion at an oil refinery\noperated by BP Products North America, Inc. (BP) that killed l5 people and injured more than\nl7o. Before bringing criminal charges, the government negotiated a guilty plea with BP without\nnotifying the victims. The government filed a sealed motion, alerting the district court to the\npotential plea and claiming that consultation with all the victims was impractical and that such\nnotification could result in media coverage that would undermine the plea negotiations. The court\nthen entered an order prohibiting the government from notifying the victims of the pending plea\nagreement until after it had been signed by the parties. Thereafter, the government filed a criminal\ninformation, the government and BP signed the plea agreement, and the government mailed notices\nof the plea hearing to the victims informing them of their right to be heard. One month later, l2\nvictims asked the court to reject the plea because it was entered into in violation of their rights\nunder the CVRA. The district court denied their motion, but concluded that the CVRA rights to\nconfer with the prosecutor in the case and to be treated with fairness and respect for the victim’s\ndignity and privacy vested prior to the initiation of charges.*4° The district court noted that the\nlegislative history reflected a view that “the right to confer was intended to be broad,” as well as\nbeing a “mechanism[]” to ensure that victims were treated with fairness.\n\nIn denying the victims relief, the Fifth Circuit nevertheless concluded that the district court\n“failed to accord the victims the rights conferred by the CVRA.”*“° In particular, the Fifth Circuit\ncited the district court’s acknouledgement that “[t]here are clearly rights under the CVRA that\napply before any prosecution is underway.” The Fifth Circuit also noted that such consultation\nwas not “an infringement” on the government’s independent prosecutorial discretion, but “it is\nonly a requirement that the government confer in some reasonable way with the victims before\nultimately exercising its broad discretion.” In the wake of the Dean opinion, two Department\ncomponents wrote separate memoranda to the Solicitor General with opposing views concerning\nwhether the CVRA right to confer with the prosecution vests prior to the initiation of a prosecution.\nIX. JUNE 2oo8: VILLAFANA’S PRE-PLEA CONTACTS WITH THE ATTORNEY\n\nREPRESENTING THE VICTIMS WHO LATER BECAME THE CVRA\n\nPETITIONERS\n\nAccording to an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation by her atorney, Bradley Edwards,\nWild retained Edwards in June 2oo8 to represent her “because she was unable to get anyone from\nthe [USAO] to tell her what was actually going on with the federal criminal case against Jeffrey\nEpstein.”*4” Villafafia told OPR that Wild did not contact her directly and she was not aware of\naH In re Dean, 527 F.3d 39l (5th Cir. 2oo8).

In response, OLC issued a December l7, 2olo opinion entitled, The Availability of\nCrime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4. Based on the CVRA’s\nlanguage, relevant case law, and memoranda opinions from Department components, OLC\nreaffirmed its 2oo5 conclusion that CVRA rights do not vest until a criminal charge has been filed\n(by complaint, information, or indictment) and the rights cease to be available if “all charges are\ndismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or if the [g]overnment declines to bring formal\ncharges after the filing of a complaint).”°”\n\nAfter OLC issued its opinion, the Department revised the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> in October 2oll\nbut did not change its fundamental position that the CVRA rights did not vest until after criminal\ncharges were filed. The 2oll revision did, houever, add language concerning victim consultation\nbefore a defendant is charged: “In circumstances where plea negotiations occur before a case has\nbeen brought, Department policy is that this should include reasonable consultation prior to the\nfiling of a charging instrument with the court.”*”? The use of the word “should” in the 2oll\n<span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> indicates that “personnel are expected to take the action . . . unless there is an\nappropriate, articulable reason not to do so.”*8° Nevertheless, the required consultation “may be\ngeneral in nature” and “does not have to be specific to a particular plea offer.”°*! The revisions\nalso specified that AUSAs were to ensure that victims had a right to be reasonably heard at plea\nproceedings.**\n\nOn November 2, 2oll, U.S. Senator Jon Kyl, a co-sponsor of the CVRA, sent a leter to\nAtorney General Eric Holder, arguing that the 2oll <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> revisions “conflict[ed] quite\nclearly with the CVRA’s plain language” because the 2oll <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> did “not extend any rights\nto victims until charges have been filed.” The Department’s response emphasized that the\n378 OLC “express[ed] no opinion” as to whether it is a mater of “good practice” to inform victims of their CVRA\nrights prior to the filing of a complaint or after the dismissal of charges.\nae See 2oll <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, Art.

Houever, the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> generally require AUSAs to use their best efforts to comply with the\nCVRA, and the CVRA specifically affords victims the right to be heard at plea proceedings.

The CVRA Litigation Proceedings and Current Status\n\nWhile the CVRA litigation was pending in the Southern District of Florida, numerous\nfederal civil suits against Epstein, brought in the same district, were transferred to the same judge\nas “related cases,” as a mater of judicial economy pursuant to the Local Rules. As the parties\nagreed on setlements in those civil cases, they were dismissed.*** Several of the victims who had\nsetled their civil cases filed a pleading in the CVRA litigation asking the court to “maintain their\nanonymity” and not “further disseminate[]” their identities to the CVRA petitioners.*®°\n\nIn the CVRA case, the petitioners claimed that the government violated their CVRA nights\nto confer by (l) negotiating and signing the NPA without victim input; (2) sending leters to the\nvictims claiming that the mater was “under investigation” after the NPA was already signed; and\n(3) not properly informing the victims that the state plea would also resolve the federal\ninvestigation. In addition, the petitioners alleged that the government violated their CVRA night\nto be treated with fairness by concealing the NPA negotiation and also violated their CVRA right\nto reasonable notice by concealing that the state court proceeding impacted the enforcement of the\nNPA and resolved the federal investigation.\n\nDuring the litigation, the USAO argued that (l) the victims had no right to notice or\nconferral about the NPA because the CVRA rights did not apply pre-charge; (2) the government’s\naB3 l57 Cong. Rec. 87359-o2 (2oll) (Kyl leter and Department response).\na8 Epstein also resolved some county court civil cases during this time period as well. In addition, numerous\nother cases were resolved outside of formal litigation. For example, one atorney told OPR that he resolved l6 victim\ncases, but did not file all cases with the court.

Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR that, while there were\nvalid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is\na case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required. I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [victim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key conclusion that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for resolution after development of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\nintention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\nconcluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*°°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, “[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]uidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4567", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004568.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 27l of 349\nthe 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> was inconsistent with positions the USAO had taken in correspondence with\nEpstein’s atorneys, in which the government acknouledged that “it had obligations to notify the\nvictims.” The court ordered the parties to submit additional briefs regarding the appropriate\nremedies. Accordingly, the petitioners requested multiple specific remedies, including rescission\nof the NPA; a writen apology to all victims from the government; a meeting with Acosta,\nVillafafia, and her supervisors; access to government records, including grand jury materials;\ntraining for USAO employees; and monetary sanctions and atorneys’ fees.*°”\n\nFollouing Epstein’s indictment on federal charges in New York and subsequent death\nwhile in custody, on September l6, 2ol9, the district judge presiding over the CVRA case denied\nthe petitioners’ motion for remedies and closed the case, stating that Epstein’s death “rendered the\nmost significant issue that was pending before the Court, namely, whether the Government’s\nviolation of Petitioners’ rights under the CVRA invalidated the NPA, moot.”**8 The court did not\norder the government to take corrective measures, but stated that it “fully expects the Government\nwill honor its representation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the\nproper treatment of crime victims.”**? The court also denied the petitioners’ request for atorneys’\nfees, finding that the government did not act in bad faith, because, “[a]lthough unsuccessful on the\nmerits of the issue of whether there was a violation of the CVRA, the Government asserted\nlegitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation.”\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, Wild appealed the district court’s rejection of the requested\nremedies, through a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit.*”° In its responsive brief, the government expressed sympathy for Wild and\n“regret[] [for] the manner in which it communicated with her in the past.”*?!

In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”*”°\n\nA. At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”— is “‘always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’”*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\nfab 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, Foreword.\nso Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-oooo458o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004581.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 284 of 349\nand consider victims’ views about, prospective plea negotiations.*’? The “prosecution stage”\nbegan when charges were filed and continued through all post-sentencing legal proceedings.*””\n\nAt the time the parties signed the NPA in September 2oo7, few courts had addressed victim\nstanding under the CVRA. Notably, district courts in New York and South Carolina had ruled that\nstanding atached only upon the filing of federal charges.*°’ Two cases relied upon by the court\nin its February 2ol9 opinion—Dean and its underlying district court opinion, BP Products—were\ndecided after the NPA was signed.\n\nThe CVRA litigation and proposed federal legislation—both pending as of the date of this\nReport—shou that the interpretation of victim standing under the CVRA continues to be a mater\nof debate.**! In a November 2l, 2ol9 leter to Atorney General William Barr, a Congressional\nRepresentative stated that she had recently introduced legislation specifically to “[c]larify that\nvictims of federal crimes have the right to confer with the Government and be informed about key\npre-charging developments in a case, such as . . . non-prosecution agreements.”*°? The CVRA\nlitigation arising from the Epstein case shous the lack of clarity regarding when CVRA rights\napply: the district court concluded that CVRA rights applied pre-charge, but a sharply divided\npanel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals came to a contrary conclusion, a decision that has\nnou been vacated while the entire court hears the case en banc.\n\nBecause the Supreme Court had not addressed the issue of when CVRA rights apply, the\nlouer courts had reached divergent conclusions, and the Department had concluded that CVRA\nrights did not apply pre-charge, OPR concludes that the subjects’ failure to consult with victims\nbefore signing the NPA did not constitute professional misconduct because at that time, the CVRA\ndid not clearly and unambiguously require prosecutors to consult with victims before the filing of\nfederal criminal charges.*\n\n398 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, Art.

The court found violations of Maryland Rules of Professional\n\n257\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo458l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004582.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 285 of 349\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel compared the language of the CVRA to the language\nof the VRRA, noting that the VRRA “clearly extends victim-notice rights into the pre-charge\nphase” and opining that the government “may well have violated” the VRRA with regards to its\ninvestigation of Epstein. As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by administrative complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official\nto “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”’—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\nidentified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the\nvictims with appropriate notification.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no recollection of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the right, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4582", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004585.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 288 of 349\nrequire victim approval of the prosecutors’ plans, but it allous victims the opportunity to express\ntheir views and to be heard before a final decision is made. The lack of consultation in this case\ndenied the victims that opportunity.*°\nI. LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\n\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\nresolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*°”\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim Specialist. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\n4o8 Villafaia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\n<span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, Art. IV, § B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners. Doe, 359 F. Supp. 3d at l2l8.\n\n4o9 Doe, 359 F. Supp. 3d at l2l9, l22l.\n26l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4585", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004586.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 289 of 349\nbreach, houever, Epstein would enter his state guilty plea and the federal investigation would end.\nThus, the statement that the case was “currently under investigation” was literally true, but the\nomission of important contextual information about the existence of the NPA deprived the victims\nof important information about the exact status of the investigation.\n\nA. The USAO Was Not Responsible for Victim Notification Leters Sent by the\n\nFBI in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and May 2oo8 Describing the Status of\nthe Case as “Under Investigation”\n\nThe 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> charged the FBI with informing the victims of CVRA rights and\navailable services during the “investigative stage” of a case. During the Epstein investigation, the\nFBI case agents complied with the agency’s notification obligation by hand delivering pamphlets\nto victims follouing their interviews and through computer-generated leters sent to the victims by\nthe FBI’s Victim Specialist. The FBI’s notification process is independent of the USAO’s. The\nUSAO has its oun Victim Witness Specialist who assumes the responsibility for victim\nnotification after an indictment or complaint moved the case into the “prosecution stage.”\n\nThe FBI’s Victim Specialist used the VNS to prepare the October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8 leters, a system the FBI regularly employs to comply with its obligations under the\n2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> to inform the victims of their rights and other services during the “investigative\nstage.” The stock language of that leter, houever, was generic and failed to communicate the\nunique case-specific status of the Epstein investigation at that time. The FBI Victim Specialist\nwho sent the leters acted at the case agent’s direction and was not aware of the existence of the\nNPA at the time she created the leters.4!° Neither FBI case agent reviewed any of the leters sent\nby the FBI’s Victim Specialist.*!! According to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the leters and\nthe wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Although the FBI case agents\ninformed Villafafia after the fact that the FBI’s Victim Specialist sent her “standard form leter,”\nVillafafia had never reviewed an FBI-generated victim notification leter and was not aware of its\ncontents.*!? Villafafia told OPR she was unaware of the content of the FBI leters until they were\ncollected for the CVRA litigation, sometime after July 2oo8.\n\n4lo The case agent told OPR that she did not recall specifically directing the Victim Specialist to send a leter,\nbut acknouledged that “she would come to us before she would approach a victim.”\n\naul The case agent told OPR that she had no role in drafting the leters and believed them to be “standard form\nleters.” Similarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “I can’t think that I’ve ever reviewed any of them . . . they just go\nfrom the victim coordinator.”\n\nale Villafafia’s lack of familiarity with the language in the FBI leters led to some inconsistency in the\ninformation provided to victims concerning their CVRA rights. Beginning in 2oo6, the FBI provided to victims\nstandard leters advising victims of their CVRA rights but which also noted that only some of the rights applied\npre-charge. During this period, Villafafia also crafted her oun introductory leters to the victims to let them knou of\ntheir CVRA rights and that the federal investigation “would be a different process” from the prior state investigation\nin which “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated by the State Atorney’s Office.” Villafafia told\nOPR that in a case in which she “need[ed] to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia’s leter itemized the CVRA\nrights, but it did not explain that those rights atached only after a formal charge had been made. The leter was hand\n\n262\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4586", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004603.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o6 of 349\nand they often cannot fully reveal either the facts or the status of an investigation, even with\nvictims. The 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> advise that in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited\nin their disclosures: “Because victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government,\nand may disclose whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only nonsensitive data and\npublic information.”*°\n\nVillafafia’s concern about generating potential impeachment evidence by informing\nvictims of their potential to recover monetary damages from Epstein was not unreasonable.\nIndeed, the case agents initially raised the impeachment issue, and after considering the problem,\nVillafafia agreed with the agents’ concerns. Villafafia raised those concerns with the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer in October 2oo7 after the agents brought the issue to her\natention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom\nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound. OPR also considered that although\nVillafafia had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her\nsupervisor, the U.S. Atorney, had decided otherwise. When authorized to inform Edwards of the\nscheduled change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global resolution that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) atendance at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the resolution of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).*4 Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential conclusion of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\nHe 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, Art. IV, J B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim notification leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\n\n“44 The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\nresolution of a sex abuse case. Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004604.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o7 of 349\nintentionally concealing information from them and was part of a series of interactions with\nvictims that led to condemnation of the government’s treatment of victims. **°\nVI. THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO TREAT VICTIMS FORTHRIGHTLY AND\n\nWITH SENSITIVITY WHEN IT FAILED TO TIMELY PROVIDE VICTIMS\n\nWITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESOLUTION OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAlthough OPR does not conclude that any of the subjects commited professional\nmisconduct, either by failing to consult with the victims before the NPA was signed or in\ninteractions afterwards, OPR’s findings are not an endorsement of the government’s course of\naction. The government’s interactions with victims confused and frustrated many of the victims,\nparticularly the two CVRA petitioners and the two victims who had unsuccessfully atempted to\njoin in the CVRA litigation. As a result, the victims’ and the public’s perception of the mater is\nthat the prosecutors worked with Epstein’s atorneys to disenfranchise and silence the victims. It\nis unfortunate, and appears fundamentally unfair to the victims, that Acosta and Sloman (after\nMenchel and Lourie departed) took the unusual step of deciding to vet the USAO victim\nnotification leters with the defense after the NPA was signed, but failed to go beyond the\nrequirements of the CVRA or the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> to consult with the victims before the NPA was\nsigned. This result is contrary to the Department’s intent, as set forth in the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, that\nDepartment employees work to “minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of crime\nendure in its wake.” When considering the entirety of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by\nthe Department.\n\nWild’s criticisms of the government’s conduct were based on interactions that are similar\nto and generally representative of the government’s interactions with other Epstein victims and\nthat demonstrate an overall lack of sensitivity to the victims by the government. Wild experienced\na series of confusing and inconsistent communications in her interactions with Villafafia and the\ncase agents. Wild received Villafafia’s leter in June 2oo7 stating inaccurately that she was a\nfederal victim entitled to CVRA rights. She was interviewed by the FBI in August 2oo7 but was\nnot told that a potential outcome was a state plea. Shortly after the September 24, 2oo7 signing of\nthe NPA, the FBI contacted her to inform her of the resolution of the federal case. Nonetheless,\non January lo, 2oo8, the FBI sent her a victims’ rights leter indicating that the case was under\ninvestigation and that some of her CVRA rights may not apply until after the defendant was\ncharged. On January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia re-interviewed Wild, along with a CEOS atorney and\nthe FBI] agents, and told Wild that the case was under investigation, but did not specifically mention\nthe NPA, although she may have mentioned a possible resolution. In mid-June 2oo8, when\nEdwards contacted Villafafia on Wild’s behalf, Villafafia informed him that the case was under\ninvestigation but did not mention the NPA. Just before Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8 state court plea,\n“45 OPR notes that, similar to Villafafia, Sloman interacted with a victim’s atorney during the time period\nbetween the signing of the NPA and Epstein’s state guilty plea. In January 2oo8, Sloman received a telephone call\nfrom his former law partner, who represented one of the victims and who asked Sloman whether the federal\ngovernment could bring charges against Epstein. Sloman, concerned about the potential for conflict of interest\nallegations due to his prior business relations with the atorney, refused to answer any questions regarding Epstein.\nBecause Sloman refused to provide any information, OPR found no basis for finding that Sloman misled the atorney.\n\n28o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004606.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o9 of 349\nto be paid to the FBI’s communications to ensure that the victims were receiving accurate and\ntimely information that was consistent with the status of the case and with the USAO’s\ncommunications with victims.*4”\n\nThe decision not to inform victims and their atorneys about the existence of the NPA gave\nvictims and the public the misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel\nto keep the agreement secret from the victims. Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“48 For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities. In certain cases, such as the\nEpstein case, prosecutors may need to provide more oversight when multiple Department\ncomponents are communicating with victims to avoid providing confusing and contradictory\nmessages.\nindependent of the NPA provision. OPR also notes that impeachment regarding the NPA provision may have\npermited the government to rehabilitate the victims through their prior statements to law enforcement. In other words,\nwhile the USAO’s view concerning potential impeachment was not unreasonable, more extensive consideration of the\ncase agent’s concerns might have led the prosecutors to conclude that the risk of the information being used to\nsignificantly damage the credibility of the victims was lou.\n\nHe In addition to the FBI leters previously discussed, another example of the inconsistent communication can\nbe seen in leters that were to be sent after Epstein entered his guilty plea to two victims residing in foreign countries.\nAlthough OPR was unable to confirm that the two victims actually received the leters, t appears from the records\nOPR reviewed that the government intended to provide them with a standard FBI leter stating that the case was under\ninvestigation while also providing them with a USAO leter stating that the case had been resolved through Epstein’s\nstate guilty plea.\n\n448 OPR understands that the Department is in the process of revising the 2oll <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>.\n\n282\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004753.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3oo_ Filed o6/l5/2l Page lo of 32 6\nL4TPDAYS\n\nl As the Court is aware, this is the defendant's fourth\n2 felony conviction for narcotics offense, and we agree with the\n3 probation office that a <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> sentence would be\n\n4 appropriate in this case.\n\nS THE COURT: Thank you very much.\n\n6 Mr. Donaldson, have you reviewed the presentence\n\n7 report?\n\n8 MR.

Timely access to\ntherapeutic services can mitigate risk to the mental health of survivors of all ages. This review of the research focuses on CSA\ndisclosures with children, youth, and adults across the life course. Using Kiteley and Stogdon’s literature review framework, 33\nstudies since 2ooo were identified and analyzed to extrapolate the most convincing findings to be considered for practice and\nfuture research. The centering question asked: What is the state of CSA disclosure research and what can be learned to apply to\npractice and future research? Using Braun and Clarke’s <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> for thematic analysis, five themes emerged: (l) Disclosure is an\niterative, interactive process rather than a discrete event best done within a relational context; (2) contemporary disclosure\nmodels reflect a social—ecological, person-in-environment orientation for understanding the complex interplay of individual,\nfamilial, contextual, and cultural factors involved in CSA disclosure; (3) age and gender significantly influence disclosure; (4) there\nis a lack of a life-course perspective; and (5) barriers to disclosure continue to outweigh facilitators. Although solid strides have\nbeen made in understanding CSA disclosures, the current state of knouledge does not fully capture a cohesive picture of dis-\nclosure processes and pathways over the life course. More research is needed on environmental, contextual, and cultural factors.\nBarriers continue to be identified more frequently than facilitators, although dialogical forums are emerging as important facil-\nitators of CSA disclosure. Implications for practice in facilitating CSA disclosures are discussed with recommendations for future\nresearch.\nKeywords\nsexual abuse, child abuse, cultural contexts\nIntroduction the same time global trends from systematic reviews and meta-\n. . . . analyses have found concerning rates of CSA, with averages of\nTimely access to auppative and therapeutic FESOUTCES for child l8-2o% for females and of 8—lo% for males (Pereda, Guilera,\nsexual abuse (CSA) survivors can mitigate risk to the health Fors, & Gemez-Benito, 2oo9).

Timely access to\ntherapeutic services can mitigate risk to the mental health of survivors of all ages. This review of the research focuses on CSA\ndisclosures with children, youth, and adults across the life course. Using Kiteley and Stogdon’s literature review framework, 33\nstudies since 2ooo were identified and analyzed to extrapolate the most convincing findings to be considered for practice and\nfuture research. The centering question asked: What is the state of CSA disclosure research and what can be learned to apply to\npractice and future research? Using Braun and Clarke’s <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> for thematic analysis, five themes emerged: (l) Disclosure is an\niterative, interactive process rather than a discrete event best done within a relational context; (2) contemporary disclosure\nmodels reflect a social—ecological, person-in-environment orientation for understanding the complex interplay of individual,\nfamilial, contextual, and cultural factors involved in CSA disclosure; (3) age and gender significantly influence disclosure; (4) there\nis a lack of a life-course perspective; and (5) barriers to disclosure continue to outweigh facilitators. Although solid strides have\nbeen made in understanding CSA disclosures, the current state of knouledge does not fully capture a cohesive picture of dis-\nclosure processes and pathways over the life course. More research is needed on environmental, contextual, and cultural factors.\nBarriers continue to be identified more frequently than facilitators, although dialogical forums are emerging as important facil-\nitators of CSA disclosure. Implications for practice in facilitating CSA disclosures are discussed with recommendations for future\nresearch.\nKeywords\nsexual abuse, child abuse, cultural contexts\nIntroduction the same time global trends from systematic reviews and meta-\n. . . . analyses have found concerning rates of CSA, with averages of\nTimely access to auppative and therapeutic FESOUTCES for child l8-2o% for females and of 8—lo% for males (Pereda, Guilera,\nsexual abuse (CSA) survivors can mitigate risk to the health Fors, & Gemez-Benito, 2oo9).

While it is true\nthat the tax shelters created fraudulent tax losses through a series of complex transactions, the\n“backdating” involved only correcting certain trades -- e.g., canceling a transaction in stock and\neffecting one in foreign currency. The new transactions were shoun in Deutsche Bank’s books\nin the month in which they occurred, No records were altered. Thus, this is not an instance of\n“hiding assets or transactions, or both, through the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or\noffshore financial accounts.” See Commentary § 2Tl.l Application Note 4.\n\nLikewise, an enhancement for “special skills” under § 3Bl.3 is unwarranted. The\nReport states that Mr. Parse “used his special skills as a former stock broker and CPA to\nmaterially facilitate his design and implementation of the highly-complex financial products that\nwere involved in different tax shelters.” § 64.

See Guerin’s Am.\nSentencing Mem. l3-l6, ECF No. 592. They have varied greatly in length. What makes this\ncase different is that David Parse did not design or market tax shelters; he was a broker executing\ntrades. Indeed, to our knouledge, of all of the brokers who performed that function for Jenkins\nand other law firms, he and Craig Brubaker were the only two people who were prosecuted, and\nhe is the only one who stands convicted.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo95l7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009526.jpg": "Case lf2oserloo336& ABcurDatupzent 6lo8/2o Filed ged Pageageioz of ll7\nA-6o75\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o5 Filed o3/l8/l3 Page 2 of 4l\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPreliminary Statement. ..... o... cece ene eee ene net te eeeeeaeed\nI.

Pauley, III\nMarch 7, 2ol3\nPage ll\n\nOur louer <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> calculation begins from the premise that Mr. Parse was\nconvicted only of the three “backdating” transactions. If that is so, then the proper loss\ncalculation is this:\n\nColeman $2,738,63o\n\nBlair $ 47o,o35\n\nAronoff $ 536,77o\n\nToporek h  '62:553\n\nTOTAL $3,8o7,988\nThese numbers are based on the additional assessments calculated by the IRS, which are in\nevidence.\n\nMoreover, if the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> calculation is based only upon the three “backdating”\ntransactions, then the enhancement for “sophisticated means” should not apply. While it is true\nthat the tax shelters created fraudulent tax losses through a series of complex transactions, the\n“backdating” involved only correcting certain trades -- e.g., canceling a transaction in stock and\neffecting one in foreign currency. The new transactions were shoun in Deutsche Bank’s books\nin the month in which they occurred, No records were altered. Thus, this is not an instance of\n“hiding assets or transactions, or both, through the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or\noffshore financial accounts.” See Commentary § 2Tl.l Application Note 4.\n\nLikewise, an enhancement for “special skills” under § 3Bl.3 is unwarranted. The\nReport states that Mr. Parse “used his special skills as a former stock broker and CPA to\nmaterially facilitate his design and implementation of the highly-complex financial products that\nwere involved in different tax shelters.” § 64. Mr. Parse, houever, had no role in designing the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolol95", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010196.jpg": "Cadac PAR OAG URE DAN l Demo PRS mi Giaew o Frits DUE ab dey O&36F afll7l 7\nA-594l\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o4 _ Filed o3/l6/l3 Page l2 of l4\n\nyA ZUCKERMAN SPAEDER up\nThe Honorable William H.

In short, his role as a broker in the three “backdating” transactions is\ntoo thin a reed to support this enhancement.\n\nIf all of this is correct, then Mr. Parse should be at offense level 24, with a\n<span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> range of 5l to 63 months. Of course, we believe that even that calculation produces a\nrange that is still far too harsh. See, e.g., Smirlock v. United States, 2oo5 U.S. Dist. Lexis 732l\nat *6 (noting that “the amount of loss that actually winds up resulting from a person’s conduct\n...can be arbitrary” and may not reflect culpability); Bouman, The Failure of the Federal\nSentencing <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>: A Structural Analysis, lo5 Colum L. Rev. l3l5, l328 (2oo5)(“[aJt or\nnear the root of virtually every serious criticism of the <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> is the concern that they are too\nharsh”).\nF. Conclusion\n\nIn her sentencing submission, Donna Guerin catalogued the sentences that have\nbeen imposed on those who designed and marketed illegal tax shelters. See Guerin’s Am.\nSentencing Mem. l3-l6, ECF No. 592. They have varied greatly in length. What makes this\ncase different is that David Parse did not design or market tax shelters; he was a broker executing\ntrades. Indeed, to our knouledge, of all of the brokers who performed that function for Jenkins\nand other law firms, he and Craig Brubaker were the only two people who were prosecuted, and\nhe is the only one who stands convicted.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolol96", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010205.jpg": "Camas i2o2 Ordo ResD AS NL eminent Gl5 S82 Abe ODP Ra AH SOLOS Tt afll7l 7\nA-6o75\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o5 Filed o3/l8/l3 Page 2 of 4l\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPreliminary Statement. ..... o... cece ene eee ene net te eeeeeaeed\nI.

The 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> Apply to the Offense Conduct\n\nBefore determining the applicable sentencing range, the Court must first resolve the\nthreshold issue of whether the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> or the 2oo4 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> applies to the criminal\nconduct in this case. It is well-setled that it is a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause for a\nsentencing court to apply a version of the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> that did not come into effect until after the\ncriminal conduct was complete if it provides for a higher sentencing range. See Peugh v. United\nStates, 569 U.S. 53o, 532-33 (2ol3) (“[T]here is an ex post facto violation when a defendant is\nsentenced under <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> promulgated after he commited his criminal acts and the new\nversion provides a higher applicable <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> sentencing range than the version in place at the\ntime of the offense.”).\n\nThere is no dispute that the 2oo4 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, which took effect on November l, 2oo4,\ncall for a much harsher sentence than the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>. If the Court applied all of the same\n! This memorandum sets forth arguments concerning the proper <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> calculation. Ms. Maxwell’s arguments\nfor why the Court should grant a substantial dounward variance from the advisory <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> range are addressed in\na separate submission entitled Sentencing Memorandum on Behalf of Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo422", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010423.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 6 of 29\nenhancements that were applied in the PSR, the recommended sentencing range under the 2oo3\n<span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> would be roughly 75% Jess than the recommended sentencing range under the 2oo4\n<span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>: l68-2lo months based on a Combined Adjusted Offense Level of 35 under the 2oo3\n<span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> versus 292-365 months based on a Combined Adjusted Offense Level of 4o under\nthe 2oo4 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>.” The parties dispute, houever, whether the offense conduct ended before\nor after November l, 2oo4, and whether a court or a jury must make that finding. See USSG §\nlBl.ll, cmt. n.2 (the “last date of the offense of conviction” is the “controlling date for ex post\nfacto purposes”).\n\nProbation and the government assert that the 2oo4 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> apply because the second\nsuperseding indictment (the “S2 Indictment’’) generally alleges that the criminal conduct ended\n“in or about 2oo4” and the Court should find based on the trial testimony and other evidence that\nthe offense conduct continued “through the end of 2oo4.” See PSR at 58. That is legally and\nfactually incorrect. For the reasons set forth more fully belou, the Court must apply the 2oo3\n<span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> in this case because (l) the jury, not the Court, must determine the end date of the\ncriminal conduct when that fact dictates which <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> book applies consistent with the Ex\nPost Facto Clause; (2) even if the Court may make that determination, the trial record is\ninsufficient to find that the offense conduct continued past November l, 2oo4, the effective date\nof the 2oo4 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>; and (3) it would not serve the goals of sentencing to apply the harsher\n2oo4 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> in this case when the record is clear that Ms. Maxwell was no longer actively\nparticipating in the offense conduct by 2oo2 or 2oo3 at the latest.\n\n? The five-point difference in the total offense level is driven by the base offense level. Under the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>,\nthe applicable base offense level is l9. See USSG § 2Gl.l(a)(l) (2oo3). Under the 2oo4 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, the applicable\nbase offense level is 24. See USSG § 2Gl.3(a) (2oo4). Ms. Maxwell disputes the application of many of the\nenhancements as discussed in Sections II-IV, infra.\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo423", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010424.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 7 of 29\n\nA. A Jury Must Determine the End Date of Criminal Conduct that Dictates\n\nWhich <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> Book Applies Consistent with the Ex Post Facto Clause.\n\nAs set forth above, it would be a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause for the Court to\nsentence Ms. Maxwell under the 2oo4 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> absent a finding that the offense conduct\ncontinued past November l, 2oo4. That finding must be made by a jury, not the sentencing\ncourt. Because the jury never made such a finding here, the Court cannot apply the 2oo4\n<span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> and must instead apply the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>.\n\nSeveral appellate courts, including the Second Circuit, have held that if the end date of\nthe offense conduct dictates whether, consistent with the Ex Post Facto Clause, a harsher penalty\nmay apply to the defendant, then that fact must be resolved by a jury. See United States v.\nJulian, 427 F.3d 47l, 48o-482 (7 Cir. 2oo5) (“As it is the lifespan of the conspiracy that\ndetermines whether, consistent with the Ex Post Facto Clause, the defendant may be subject to\nthe enhanced penalty [of l8 U.S.C. § 2423], the question whether the alleged conspiracy\ncontinued beyond the effective date of the new penalty is one that must be submited to the\njury.”); United States v. Tykarsky, 446 F.3d 458, 478-48o (3d Cir. 2oo6) (“[B]ecause the\ncommunications spanned two different versions of the statute [l8 U.S.C. § 2422] with different\nminimum penalties, the question of whether the violation extended beyond the effective date of\nthe amended version was one that had to be resolved by the jury.”); United States v. Harris, 79\nF.3d 223 (2d Cir. l996) (noting that when the offense conduct for a continuing criminal offense\nis alleged to straddle the date when the applicable penalty increased, the jury must determine\nwhether the criminal conduct continued past the date of the change for purposes of the Ex Post\nFacto Clause); United States v. Torres, 9ol F.2d 2o5, 226-27 (2d Cir. l99o) (same), overruled\non other grounds as recognized by United States v. Marcus, 628 F.3d 36 (2d Cir. 2olo).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo424", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010425.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 _ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 8 of 29\n\nIn each of these cases, the ex post facto violation resulted from an increase in the\napplicable statutory penalty, as opposed to the applicable sentencing range under the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>.\nHouever, the Supreme Court has clearly held that it is also a violation of the Ex Post Facto\nClause to apply a later version of the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> that increases the recommended sentencing\nrange if the criminal conduct was complete before the later version took effect. See Peugh, 569\nU.S. at 532-33 (“[T]here is an ex post facto violation when a defendant is sentenced under\n<span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> promulgated after he commited his criminal acts and the new version provides a\nhigher applicable <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> sentencing range than the version in place at the time of the\noffense.”). An ex post facto violation is an ex post facto violation regardless of whether the\nincreased penalty resulted from a change in the statute or a change in the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>. Hence, if\nthe end date of the offense conduct dictates whether it is permissible to apply a later <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>\nbook consistent with the Ex Post Facto Clause, the jury must find that fact.\n\nHere, the S2 Indictment alleges only that the criminal conduct ended “in or about 2oo4”\nand does not specify whether the conduct continued into November and December 2oo4. Nor\nwas the jury asked to make a specific finding as to the end date of the offense conduct. Because\nthe jury did not make the necessary factual finding, the Court cannot apply the 2oo4 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>\nand must instead apply the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>.°\n\nB. The Trial Record Is Insufficient to Support a Finding that the Offense\n\nConduct Continued Past November l, 2oo4.\n\nEven if the Court can determine the end date of the offense conduct for <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>\n\npurposes, the record does not support a finding that the conduct extended past November l,\n3 Although the issue is properly framed as an ex post facto issue, it would also violate Ms. Maxwell’s Sixth\nAmendment rights for the Court, and not the jury, to determine when the offense conduct ended. See Apprendi v.\nNew Jersey, 53o U.S. 466 (2ooo); Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296 (2oo4); United States v. Booker, 543 U.S.\n22o (2oo5); see also Julian, 427 F.3d at 482 (failure to have the jury determine the end date of the conspiracy for ex\npost facto purposes was a violation of the defendant’s Sixth Amendment rights).\n\n4\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo425", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010426.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 9 of 29\n2oo4, as the government asserts. The government’s claim is based solely on (l) Carolyn’s vague\nrecollection that she stopped performing sexualized massages for Epstein in 2oo5 when she was\nl8 years old (Tr. l525, l549), and (2) two message pad slips that were never admited in\nevidence. (GX 4-B, GX 4-F). Such meager and unreliable evidence is insufficient to support a\nfinding that the offense conduct continued into the last two months of 2oo4, especially when that\ndetermination has such a significant effect on the recommended sentencing range. Instead, the\ncredible evidence in the trial record established, at most, that Epstein was receiving sexualized\nmassages in his Palm Beach residence through the summer of 2oo4, before the 2oo4 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>\ntook effect.\n\nCarolyn’s recollection that she was l8 when she stopped seeing Epstein cannot be\ncredited. (Tr. l525, l549). Carolyn’s memory of the timeline of events—in particular, her age\nat the time of the relevant events—was demonstrably inconsistent and unreliable. For example,\nCarolyn initially testified that she was l4 years old when Virginia Roberts first took her to\nEpstein’s Palm Beach residence, which would have been in 2ool. (Tr. l5l8-l9, l525; GX-ll).\nHouever, when Carolyn was confronted on cross-examination with her prior deposition\ntestimony in 2oo9, she agreed that Virginia first took her to Epstein’s house in May or June 2oo2\nwhen she was l5 years old, as she stated in her deposition. (Tr. l57o-73). Then on redirect\nCarolyn changed her testimony yet again and testified that she first went to Epstein’s house when\nshe was l3 years old, which would have been in 2ooo. (Tr. l693). Carolyn also testified that\nshe was “l5, going to be l6” when she recruited her friend Tatum to give Epstein massages,\nwhich would have been touards the end of 2oo2 or early 2oo3. (Tr. l544). Houever, according\nto the message pad slips that were admited in evidence, the earliest of which dates to January\n2oo3, Tatum did not begin calling the Palm Beach residence until April 2oo4 when Carolyn was\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo426", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010428.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page ll of 29\nevidence indicates that Carolyn stopped performing sexualized massages for Epstein at the latest\nin the summer of 2oo4, not in 2oo5.°\n\nThe two message pad slips cited by the government (GX 4-B, GX 4-F) do not support a\nfinding that the offense conduct lasted beyond November l, 2oo4. Although these two messages\nwere labeled as government exhibits along with the rest of the message slips in the same book\n(GX 4-A-K), these messages were never admited in evidence. The Court admited the message\nslips from three other message books (GX l-3) because Juan Alessi and Nicole Hesse recognized\ntheir signatures and/or handwriting in those books and could establish a business records\nfoundation for their admission. (Tr. 877-889, l772-l79o). The government presumably did not\nhave anyone who could do the same for GX 4 or it would certainly have admited the message\nslips from that book as well. The Court should not rely on two isolated, unauthenticated\ndocuments in determining when the offense conduct ended, especially when they would almost\nsingle-handedly increase the recommended sentencing range by over lo years. Cf United States\nv. Cordoba-Murgas, 233 F.3d 7o4, 7o8 (2d Cir. 2ooo) (acknouledging that enhancements based\non relevant conduct may result in sentences that are “excessive, inappropriate, and unintended\nunder Sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>” when imposed “without regard to the weight of the evidence\nproving the relevant conduct”); United States v. Gigante, 94 F.3d 53, 56 (2d Cir. l996) (holding\nthat, for sentencing purposes, “the preponderance standard is no more than a threshold basis for\nadjustments and departures, and the weight of the evidence, at some point along a continuum of\nsentence severity, should be considered”) (emphasis in original).\n>In her 2oo7 interview with the FBI, which the government cites in its oun objections to the PSR, Carolyn stated\nthat she went to Epstein’s residence “over loo times for approximately three years beginning when she was l4 years\nold.” See PSR at 54. According to that timeline, Carolyn last visited Epstein when she was l7.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo428", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010429.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page l2 of 29\n\nFurthermore, it would be improper for the Court to rely on Carolyn’s recollection and the\nmessage slips to find that the offense conduct lasted until 2oo5 because the government alleged\nin the S2 Indictment that the offense conduct ended “in or about 2oo4,” not “in or about 2oo5.”\nThe initial indictment charged Ms. Maxwell with offenses that lasted “up to and including in or\nabout l997.” (Ind. 9 9, l3, l5, l9). The S2 Indictment, which the government filed after it had\nlocated and interviewed Carolyn, charged offense conduct that lasted “up to and including in or\nabout 2oo4.” (S2 Ind. 9§ ll, l7, 23, 27). The expanded end date of the S2 Indictment was based\nsolely on Carolyn’s anticipated testimony and corroborating evidence. Yet the government\nalleged that the offense conduct ended in 2oo4, even though the government knew Carolyn’s\nrecollection of when she last visited Epstein and was aware of the two message slips when it\nfiled the S2 Indictment. The Court should hold the government to its allegations and not allou it\nto expand the end date of the offense conduct for purposes of sentencing. See United States v.\nBennet, 37 F.3d 687, 7oo (l* Cir. l994) (“In determining ‘the last date of the offense of\nconviction’ for ex post facto purposes and ... Application Note [2 of § lBl.ll], it is only\nreasonable to hold the Government to its oun alleged dates.”).\n\nFor these reasons, the record is insufficient for the Court to find that the offense conduct\ncontinued past November l, 2oo4, the effective date of the 2oo4 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>. The Court must\ntherefore apply the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> to avoid an ex post facto violation.\n\nC. The Goals of Sentencing Are Not Served by Applying the More Onerous\n\n2oo4 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> Based Solely on Epstein’s Conduct.\n\nIf the Court finds that the offense conduct continued past November l, 2oo4, it should\nnevertheless vary dounwardly and sentence Ms. Maxwell as if the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> apply. The\nvariance would account for the fact that Ms. Maxwell had stopped actively participating in the\noffense conduct by 2oo3 at the latest, when the earlier <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> were in effect. Such a\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo429", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010430.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page l3 of 29\nvariance would provide just punishment for the offense and promote respect for the law because\nit would punish Ms. Maxwell only for the conduct for which she was directly responsible, rather\nthan artificially inflating her sentence based on two months’ worth of Epstein’s criminal conduct\nin which she was not involved.\n\nThere is no evidence in the record that Ms. Maxwell did anything in furtherance of the\nconspiracy in November or December 2oo4. In fact, the evidence clearly shoued that by that\ntime, Ms. Maxwell was in a commited relationship with another man and Sarah Kellen had\ntaken over responsibility for scheduling the massage appointments at the Palm Beach residence.\nMs. Maxwell’s assistant, Cimberly Espinosa, testified that by 2oo2 Ms. Maxwell had “moved\non” from Epstein, had stopped coming to the office, and had begun a long-term relationship with\nTed Wait. (Tr. 237o-7l, 2374, 2378-8o). Juan Alessi testified that Sarah Kellen, whom he\nrecalled seeing for the first time touards the end of his employment in 2oo2, “immediately took\nover” responsibility for answering the phones and scheduling the massage appointments at the\nPalm Beach residence as soon as she was hired. (Tr. 832-33). Carolyn testified that Ms.\nMaxwell called her to schedule massage appointments only in “the first year or two” and that\nSarah Kellen called her thereafter. (Tr. l527). In sum, the record is clear that by 2oo2 or 2oo3 at\nthe latest Ms. Maxwell had stopped actively participating in the offense conduct and had been\nreplaced by Kellen.\n\nApplying the 2oo4 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> would significantly increase Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing\nrange based on a finding by a mere preponderance that her co-conspirator Epstein engaged in\noffense conduct in the final two months of 2oo4 that Ms. Maxwell had nothing to do with and\nwas not personally responsible for. That result would be fundamentally unjust and contrary to\nthe purposes of sentencing. See United States v. Reuter, 463 F.3d 792, 793 (7\" Cir. 2oo6)\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo43o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010431.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page l4 of 29\n(Posner, J.) (“A judge might reasonably conclude that a sentence based almost entirely on\nevidence that satisfied only the normal civil standard of proof would be unlikely to promote\nrespect for the law or provide just punishment for the offense of conviction.”). Accordingly, the\nCourt should exercise its discretion to vary from the 2oo4 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> and sentence Ms. Maxwell\nunder the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>. See id. (the § 3553(a) sentencing factors “are broad enough and\nloose enough to allou the judge to dip belou the <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> range if he is justifiably reluctant to\nimpose a sentence most of which rests entirely on a finding of fact supported by a mere\npreponderance of the evidence”).\n\nIl. The Five-Point Adjustment Under USSG § 4Bl.5 Does Not Apply.\n\nProbation and the government seek to substantially increase Ms. Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>\nrange by adding a five-point adjustment under USSG § 4Bl.5 applicable to a “Repeat and\nDangerous Sex Offender Against Minors.” That one adjustment increases Ms. Maxwell’s\nadvisory sentencing range from l68-2lo months to 292-365 months — a roughly 75% increase.\nBut § 4Bl.5 was intended to apply only to habitual sexual offenders who present a high risk of\nrecidivism and pose “a continuing danger to the public.” USSG § 4Bl.5, cmt. background. The\nfacts of this case fall far outside the scenarios that Congress and the Sentencing Commission\nwere trying to address with § 4Bl.5. Here, the government concedes that the defendant is nota\ndanger to the public, there is no evidence that the defendant herself is sexually atracted to\nminors, the conduct that gives rise to the adjustment ended almost 2o years ago, and there is no\nevidence that the defendant has re-offended and no concern that she will ever re-offend.\nMoreover, the application of § 4Bl.5 to Ms. Maxwell would lead to absurd results that the\nSentencing Commission did not contemplate. Section 4Bl.5 therefore does not apply.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo43l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010432.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Pagel5 of 29\n\nA, Ms. Maxwell Does Not Present a Continuing Danger to the Public.\n\nIt is clear from the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> commentary and the Congressional intent underlying the\ncreation of § 4Bl.5 that the adjustment does not apply to Ms. Maxwell. The Sentencing\nCommission created § 4Bl.5 after the passage of the Protection of Children from Sexual\nPredators Act of l998 (the “Act”). See Pub. Law lo5-3l4 (Oct. 3o, l998). As part of the Act,\nCongress directed the Sentencing Commission to review and amend the Sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>\napplicable to several offenses involving child sexual abuse and exploitation, including the\nenticement and transportation offenses charged in the S2 Indictment, to ensure they were\n“appropriately severe.” /d., Section 5o2.

In response, the Sentencing Commission created § 4Bl.5, which was\nadded to the Sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> on November l, 2ool. See USSG, App’x C, amend. 6l5.\n\nThe legislative history of the Act makes clear that the purpose of the law, and § 4Bl.5\nspecifically, was to protect children from habitual sexual predators and to inflict severe\npunishments on repeat (and often violent) offenders who present a significant risk of recidivism.\nCongress was particularly concerned about the danger these defendants pose to the community\nbecause they are typically far more likely to re-offend than other criminal defendants — a fact\nwhich numerous members of Congress cited as a primary justification for the passage of the Act.\n\ne “Constituents deserve to be protected from society’s worst offender-- the repeat\n\nsexual predator.... [T]he recidivism rates of sex offenders are astonishingly\nhigh — released rapists are lo times more likely to repeat their crime than other\ncriminals.

The\ncommentary to the guideline explains that the adjustment should only apply to defendants who\npresent a continuing danger to the community because there is a significant risk that they will re-\noffend if they are released from prison. See USSG § 4Bl.5, cmt. background (“This guideline is\nintended to provide lengthy incarceration for offenders who commit sex offenses against minors\nand who present a continuing danger to the public.” (emphasis added); see also United States v.\nBroxmeyer, 699 F.3d 265, 285 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (“We further note that this guideline [$4Bl.5] is\nintended to identify ‘repeat sex offenders,’ who pose ‘a continuing danger to the public.’” (citing\nUSSG § 4Bl.5 cmt. background)). The title of the enhancement itself reflects that it should only\nbe applied to “Repeat and Dangerous” sex offenders.

The government ignores the background commentary to § 4Bl.5, which explicitly states\nthat the adjustment only applies to sex offenders “who present a continuing danger to the\npublic.” USSG § 4Bl.5, cmt. background (emphasis added). In doing so, the government\nrejects an authoritative statement from the Sentencing Commission about the proper\ninterpretation and application of § 4Bl.5. See Stinson v. United States, 5o8 U.S. 36, 38 (l993)\n(“[C]ommentary in the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> Manual that interprets or explains a guideline is authoritative\nunless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly\nerroneous reading of, that guideline.”). The government is not at liberty to reject the Sentencing\nCommission’s instructions, and neither is the Court.\n\nApplying § 4Bl.5 to Ms. Maxwell would directly contradict the intent of Congress and\nthe explicit instructions of the Sentencing Commission and would improperly add over lo years\nto her sentencing range. It was not meant to be applied in cases where the defendant is not a\ndanger to the community and poses no risk of recidivism. It should not be applied here.\n\nB. Applying § 4Bl.5 Would Lead to Absurd Results.\n\nApplying § 4Bl.5 would also yield a sentencing range for Ms. Maxwell that is\nsignificantly higher than the range for a proven recidivist sex offender — i.e., the type of\ndefendant that Congress and the Sentencing Commission were so clearly targeting with § 4Bl.5.\nThe Court should not interpret a guideline in such a way that it would lead to such obviously\nabsurd results. See United States v. Pope, 554 F.3d 24o, 246 (2d Cir. 2oo9).\n\nSection 4Bl.5 contains two prongs — one that applies to defendants who have been\nconvicted of at least one prior sex offense (USSG § 4Bl.5(a)) and one that applies to defendants\nwho have not been convicted of a prior sex offense (USSG § 4Bl.5(b)). As discussed above, the\npurpose of the Act and § 4Bl.5 was to increase the sentences given to repeat sex offenders. It\nfollous that convicted sex offenders who re-offend after being released from prison should\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo435", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010436.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page l9 of 29\nreceive more serious punishment than those defendants who have never been convicted of a sex\noffense. In this case, the reverse would happen. If we assume for the sake of argument that Ms.\nMaxwell had been convicted of a prior sex offense and that § 4Bl.5(a) therefore applied, Ms.\nMaxwell’s recommended sentencing range under the 2oo4 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> would be 262-327 months\nbased on a Combined Adjusted Offense Level of 35 and a criminal history category of V. See\nUSSG §§ 4Bl.5(a)(l)(A) & (a)(2)(B) (2oo4). By contrast, if we assume the facts—i.e., that Ms.\nMaxwell has never been convicted of a prior sex offense and § 4Bl.5(b) therefore applies—her\nrecommended sentencing range under the 2oo4 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> is 292-365 months based on a\nCombined Adjusted Offense Level of 4o and a criminal history category of I. See USSG §§\n4Bl.5(b)(l) & (b)(2) (2oo4). Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell is subject to a substantially higher\n<span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> range than a defendant who had been previously convicted of a sex offense. Such a\nresult would be unjust and contrary to the express purpose of § 4Bl.5.°\n\nFurthermore, by applying § 4Bl.5 Ms. Maxwell would face the same sentencing range\nthat Jeffrey Epstein would face for the same offenses, even though he was indisputably the more\nculpable offender. It would be fundamentally unjust and contrary to the goals of sentencing for\nthe Court to apply the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> in a way that would create no meaningful distinction between\nthe most serious offenders and those with lesser culpability. See United States v. Dorvee, 6l6\nF.3d l74, l86-87 (2d Cir. 2olo) (“[A]dherence to the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> results in virtually no\ndistinction between the sentences for [less culpable] defendants ... and the sentences for the most\ndangerous offenders.... This result is fundamentally incompatible with § 3553(a).”); see also\nUnited States v. Cavera, 55o F.3d l8o, l9l (2d Cir. 2oo8) (citing Kimbrough v. United States,\n\n6 A similar disparity would occur under the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, which should apply in this case for the reasons already\ndiscussed.\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo436", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010437.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 2o of 29\n552 U.S. 85, lo8-o9 (2oo7) (“[A] district court may vary from the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> range based solely\non a policy disagreement with the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, even where that disagreement applies to a wide\nclass of offenders or offenses.”). Section 4Bl.5 should therefore not apply.\nTil. Ms. Maxwell Does Not Qualify for an Aggravating Role Adjustment Under USSG §\n3BLL.\n\nA. Ms. Maxwell Did Not Supervise Another Criminal Participant.\n\nUnder the plain language of USSG § 3Bl.l and its commentary, Ms. Maxwell does not\nqualify for an aggravating role enhancement. The <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> are clear that for any of the three\naggravating role enhancements to apply, the Court must first find that Ms. Maxwell supervised at\nleast one other criminal participant in the offense. USSG § 3Bl.l, cmt. n.2 (“To qualify for an\nadjustment under this section, the defendant must have been the organizer, leader, manager, or\nsupervisor of one or more other participants.” (emphasis added)); United States v. Skys, 637 F.3d\nl46, l56 (2d Cir. 2oll) (citing USSG § 3Bl.l, cmt. n.2). A “participant” is defined as “‘a person\nwho is criminally responsible for the commission of the offense, but need not have been\nconvicted.” USSG § 3Bl.l cmt. n.l; Skys, 637 F.3d at l56.\n\nThere is no evidence in the trial record that Ms. Maxwell supervised another criminal\nparticipant in the offenses against “Jane,” Annie Farmer, or Carolyn, which form the basis for the\nthree offense groups in the PSR. See PSR 4] 89-9o.” According to the trial testimony, the only\ncriminal participants in the offenses involving “Jane” and Annie Farmer were Epstein and Ms.\nMaxwell. There is certainly no support in the record that Ms. Maxwell supervised Epstein. In\nfact, the record is clear that the opposite is true: Epstein directed and managed Ms. Maxwell,\n\n7 Because the Court ruled that “Kate” is not a victim of the offenses of conviction, Probation and the government\nagree that the conduct related to “Kate” cannot be treated as a separate offense group and is not subject to a\n<span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> analysis. See PSR at 58-59. We therefore do not address the application of any enhancements or\nadjustments based on evidence related to “Kate.” Regardless, there is no evidence in the record that Ms. Maxwell\nsupervised another criminal participant in her offense conduct.\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo437", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010440.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 23 of 29\nthat she did so in connection with the offense conduct related to “Jane,” Annie Farmer, or\nCarolyn. The aggravating role enhancement therefore does not apply to any of the three offense\ngroups.\n\nB. The Criminal Activity Was Not “Otherwise Extensive”\n\nEven if the Court finds that Ms. Maxwell supervised another “participant,” the record\ndoes not support a finding that the criminal activity related to “Jane,” Annie Farmer, or Carolyn\nwas “otherwise extensive,” as the government contends.’ Under the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, the Court must\ntreat each minor victim separately and consider whether the enhancement applies based solely on\nthe criminal activity related to that minor victim. See USSG § 2Gl.3, cmt. n.6 (“[S]ubsection\n(d)(l) directs that if the relevant conduct of an offense of conviction includes travel or\ntransportation to engage in a commercial sex act or prohibited sexual conduct in respect to more\nthan one minor ... each such minor shall be treated as if contained in a separate count of\nconviction.”). For example, the government cannot use conduct from the 2ool-2oo4 time period\nrelated to Carolyn to justify applying the aggravating role enhancement to the criminal activity in\nl994-l997 related to “Jane” or in l996 related to Annie Farmer.\n\nThe government nevertheless atempts to justify the enhancement as to each of the three\nminor victims by making a broad assertion about the nature and scope of the conspiracy as a\nwhole, rather than making an individualized determination that the criminal activity was\n“otherwise extensive” as to each. (See PSR at 59). Because that is insufficient to establish that\nthe criminal activity was “otherwise extensive,” Ms. Maxwell should, at most, be subject to a\ntwo-point enhancement under USSG § 3Bl.l(c).\n\n° The government does not argue that the aggravating role enhancement applies because the criminal activity\ninvolved “five or more participants,” conceding that the trial record does not support the conclusion that five or\nmore people criminally participated in the offense conduct.\nIo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo44o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010441.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 24 of 29\nIV. The Two-Point “Undue Influence” Enhancement Under USSG § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B)\n\nDoes Not Apply.\n\nFinally, it would be improper for the Court to apply a two-level enhancement on the\ngrounds that a participant in the criminal activity “unduly influenced a minor to engage in\nprohibited sexual conduct.” USSG § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B). First, it would constitute impermissible\ndouble-counting to apply § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B) to the offense conduct related to “Jane,” Annie\nFarmer, and Carolyn because it would punish Ms. Maxwell for the same harm that was fully\naccounted for in the base offense level for Counts Three, Four, and Six. “Impermissible double\ncounting occurs when one part of the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> is applied to increase the defendant’s sentence\nto reflect the kind of harm that has already been fully accounted for by another part of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>.” United States v. Watkins, 667 F.3d 254, 26l (2d Cir. 2ol2). Ms. Maxwell was\nconvicted of conspiring to “entice” and “coerce” minors to travel to engage in prohibited sexual\nconduct and “enticing” minors to engage in commercial sex acts. (S2 Ind. 4] l2, 24, 27).'°\nWebster’s Dictionary defines the word “entice” to mean “to atract artfully or adroitly or by\narousing hope or desire; tempt” and the further explains that the word “tempt” “implies the\npresenting of an atraction so strong that it overcomes the restraints of conscience or beter\njudgment.”!! Similarly, Webster’s Dictionary defines the word “coerce” to mean “to compel to\nan act or choice” and further explains that the word “compel” “typically suggests overcoming of\nresistance or unwillingness by an irresistible force.”'* Accordingly, the base offense level for\n!o Count Three charged a conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity. S2 Ind. {f\nl6-l9. Although this offense does not contain an element of “enticement” or “coercion,” the offense conduct for\nCounts One, Three, and Five (the three conspiracy counts) was consolidated under Count Three for the purposes of\nsentencing, pursuant to the Court’s order. See Dkt. 657.\n\n' Available at Meriam-Webster.com Dictionary, Merriam-Webster, htps://www.merriam-\nwebster.com/dictionary/coerce (accessed June l5, 2o22).\n2 Available at Meriam-Webster.com Dictionary, Merriam-Webster, htps://www.merriam-\nwebster.com/dictionary/compel (accessed June l5, 2o22).\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo44l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010442.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 25 of 29\nCounts Three, Four, and Six already includes the concept of “unduly influenc[ing] a minor to\nengage in prohibited sexual conduct.” The enhancement therefore should not be applied to any\nof the three offense groups.\n\nSecond, under the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, which should apply in this case, the analogous two-\npoint enhancement only applies if “a participant otherwise unduly influenced a minor to engage\nin a commercial sex act.’ USSG § 2Gl.l(b)(4)(B) (2oo3) (emphasis added). There is no\nevidence that “Jane” or Annie Farmer engaged in a commercial sex act. Accordingly, the\nenhancement should not apply to their two offense groups (Groups l| and 2).\n\nThird, the evidence does not support that Carolyn was “unduly influenced” to provide\nsexualized massages to Epstein. The “undue influence” enhancement applies when “a\nparticipant’s influence over the minor compromised the voluntariness of the minor’s behavior.”\nUSSG § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B), Appl. Note 3(B). “[T]he defining characteristic of undue influence is\nthat it involves a situation where the influencer has succeeded in altering the behavior of the\ntarget.” United States v. Paterson, 576 F.3d 43l, 443 (7th Cir. 2oo9) (internal quotation marks\nomited). Apart from Virginia Roberts initially offering Carolyn the opportunity to massage\nEpstein, the record indicates that Carolyn sought out additional massage appointments herself\nand recruited other minors to perform sexualized massages to make more money. (Tr. l527-28,\nl543-46). Carolyn further testified that after she became pregnant, she returned to Epstein\nwithout being contacted to earn additional money. (Tr. l548-49). In addition, Carolyn was not\nso influenced by Epstein or Ms. Maxwell that she did whatever they asked of her. Carolyn\ntestified that she refused their offers to have her travel with them to Epstein’s island. (Tr. l534-\n35). In sum, the record does not support the conclusion that Ms. Maxwell or anyone else\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo442", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010443.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 26 of 29\ncompromised the voluntariness of Carolyn’s behavior. Accordingly, the enhancement should not\napply to Carolyn’s offense group (Group 3).\n\nV.

As set forth belou, we request\nthat the Court grant Ms. Maxwell a significant variance belou the advisory Sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>\nrange of 292 - 365 months and belou the 24o-month sentence recommended by the Probation\nDepartment (““Probation’’).\n\nGhislaine Maxwell stands before the Court because of her association with Jeffrey Epstein\ndecades ago in the l99os and early 2ooos. Never before that time and never again in the roughly\n2o-year period since the conduct underlying this case occurred has Ms. Maxwell ever been accused\nof a crime, much less a scheme to sexually abuse minors. The witnesses at trial testified about Ms.\nMaxwell’s facilitation of Epstein’s abuse, but Epstein was always the central figure: Epstein was\nthe mastermind, Epstein was the principal abuser, and Epstein orchestrated the crimes for his\npersonal gratification.

Ms. Maxwell cannot and should not bear all the\npunishment for which Epstein should have been held responsible. Ms. Maxwell has already\nexperienced hard time during detention under conditions far more onerous and punitive than any\nexperienced by a typical pretrial detainee, and she is preparing to spend significantly more time\nbehind bars.

Gall, 552 U.S. at 49-5o.\nAs directed by the Supreme Court, a district court “may not presume that a sentence within the\napplicable <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> range is reasonable.” Nelson v.

The government has never argued, in connection with Ms. Maxwell’s\nbail applications or otherwise, that Ms. Maxwell is a danger to the community; nor could they.\nApart from the conduct at issue in this case, which occurred almost 2o to 3o years ago, Ms.\nMaxwell has never once been accused of a crime, much less sexual abuse of minors. In fact, after\nleaving Epstein, Ms. Maxwell was involved in commited, long-term relationships with two men,\nboth of whom had young children who continue to support her. Ms. Maxwell is not a dangerous\ncriminal or a habitual offender. She is someone who wants nothing more than to live a normal\nfamily life — something she was denied because of her association with Epstein and will nou\nalmost certainly never have. The public does not need to be protected from Ms. Maxwell and such\nconsiderations should have no weight in determining her sentence.\nA <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> Sentence is Not Necessary to Achieve Specific or General Deterrence\n\nA <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> sentence for Ms. Maxwell would not serve the sentencing goals of either\nspecific or general deterrence. A significant sentence is not necessary to achieve the goal of\nindividual deterrence here. This is Ms. Maxwell’s only brush with the law. Ms. Maxwell has\nalready learned a painful lesson from her arrest and prosecution, has lost her marriage and her\nstepchildren, and has been harshly punished during pre-sentence incarceration. Ms. Maxwell\nhas already shoun that she will not reoffend and does not need to be further deterred from\ncommiting crimes in the future.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo465", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010466.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 _ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 2o of 77\n\nNor can general deterrence be used to justify a harsh sentence for Ms. Maxwell. Probation\nidentifies two groups of potential offenders who will purportedly be deterred from commiting\nfuture crimes as a result of Ms. Maxwell’s sentence: (l) sexual predators who exploit and degrade\nminor victims and (2) “untouchable individuals who feel their privilege and affluence entitle them\nto victimize others without fear or consequence.” PSR at 67. With regard to the first group, courts\nhave expressed legitimate doubt as to whether people who have a sexual predilection for minors\ncan be deterred at all. See, e.g., United States v. D.M., 942 F. Supp. 2d 327, 346 (E.D.N.Y. 2ol3)\n(“[T]he compulsive behavior and disorders motivating many offenders is less susceptible to\ngeneral deterrence.”). With regard to the second group, the purported justification sweeps far too\nbroadly. Rather than identify a particular class of similarly situated defendants who will be\ndeterred from commiting specific crimes, Probation essentially makes the sweeping assertion that\na harsh sentence for Ms. Maxwell is necessary to deter rich people from exploiting poor people.\nSee PSR at 67. That is not the purpose of general deterrence and should not be given any weight\nin determining the appropriate sentence.\nA Belou <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> Sentence Would Provide Just Punishment, Promote Respect for the\nLaw, and Avoid Unwarranted Sentencing Disparities\n\nWhile the offense conduct is indisputably serious, the record reflects that Epstein was the\nmain offender. Given the foregoing discussion, a shorter term of incarceration for Ms. Maxwell\nbest serves the long-term goals of punishment. A significantly belou-<span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> sentence in this\ncase would also promote respect for the law by demonstrating that the justice system considers\neach person who comes before the Court as an individual. A sentence tailored to Ghislaine\nMaxwell’s particular circumstances—would appropriately distinguish between this defendant and\nmore culpable individuals similarly charged. See United States v. Dorvee, 6l6 F.3d l74, l87 (2d\nCir. 2olo) (“[C]Jourts must guard against unwarranted similarities among sentences for defendants\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo466", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010467.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 2l of 77\nwho have been found guilty of dissimilar conduct.”) (citing Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 55\n(2oo7)).\n\nIn addition, a non-<span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> sentence would avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. It\nwould be plainly unjust to sentence Ghislaine Maxwell as if she were Jeffrey Epstein. Had Epstein\nbeen tried on this indictment he would have been exposed to a comparable guideline range. Justice\nwould not be served by sentencing Ms. Maxwell to the extent of the more culpable Epstein. Nor\nshould she be sentenced as if she were Harvey Weinstein. Follouing a state jury trial convicting\nhim of forcible rape, Weinstein received a prison sentence of 23 years, less than the louest part of\nthe guideline range calculated by Probation for Ms. Maxwell.\n\nMoreover, a non-<span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> sentence would at least mitigate the drastic disparity between\nthe penalties under state and federal law in this case. The predicate state offense in Counts Three\nand Four — New York Penal Law § l3o.55 — is a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum term of\n9o days’ imprisonment. See United States v. Broun, 843 F.3d 74, 88-89 & n.2 (2d Cir. 2ol6)\n(Pooler, J., dissenting) (noting the stark difference in sentences for offenses involving the sexual\nexploitation of minors under federal law versus New York State law). Viewing the conduct of\nconviction in the light most favorable to the government, imposition of a guideline sentence for\nMs. Maxwell will lead to inequitable and disparate results.\n\nIn this case, the goals of sentencing will be achieved by a significant dounward variance\nfrom the unduly harsh <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> range of 292 - 365 months and Probation’s recommended 24o-\nmonth sentence for offense conduct that occurred l8 to 28 years ago and where a 6o-year-old\nfemale defendant with no prior- or post-offense history of misconduct requires no rehabilitation\nby incarceration and poses no risk of recidivism.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo467", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010477.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document663_ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 3l of 77\nguards commented that they had never seen a non-violent, non-suicidal detainee subjected to such\ndrastic conditions.”!The treatment was not based on any claim or evidence that Ms. Maxwell was\nsuicidal, dangerous, violent, or in need of discipline. Quite the contrary. The policies and actions\nimplemented to detain Ms. Maxwell violated clearly established rights of inmates to be free from\npunishment and unreasonable searches. Courts have been confronted with cases challenging\nconditions of confinement in the MDC. See Turkman v. Hasty, 789 F.3d 2l8 (2d Cir. 2ol5), which\ninvolved many of the same challenges to conditions of confinement.\n\nThere can be no dispute that Ms. Maxwell’s detention was far more arduous and constituted\na more serious penalty than conventional detention is general population. While the hardship of\nimprisonment is normally measured in quantitative terms, i.e., by the length of the prison term, the\nhardship and deprivations experienced by Ms. Maxwell also had a qualitative aspect. The\ndifference between Ms. Maxwell’s isolation and typical prison conditions is so pronounced that\nthey differ not only in degree but in nature. This distinction demands a different calibration\nwhereby each day spent in isolation - especially where isolation is not based on any behavior\nmanifested by the inmate and while the inmate is presumed innocent - should result in an enhanced\ntime-served credit.\nIncarceration During the Pandemic Supports a Well-Recognized Sentence Reduction\n\nCourts in this district and elsewhere have acknouledged COVID hardship as a basis for\ndounward variances from the <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>. But even “before the current pandemic, courts had\nrecognized that periods of pre-sentence custody spent in unusually hard conditions merited\nrecognition by courts in measuring the just sentence.” United States v. Romero, l5 CR. 445-l8\n*! Other similarly charged defendants, e.g., Keith Raniere , l8 Cr. 2o4 (NGG) (NEXIUM case), and\nRobert Sylvester Kelly, aka “R. Kelly,” l9 Cr. 286 (AMD), were detained in general population.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo477", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010479.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document663_ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 33 of 77\n\nAcknouledging that COVID hardship is a basis for dounward variance, courts in this\nDistrict have given credit for each day of pretrial detention served during the pandemic See, e.g.,\nUnited States v.

Based on the underpinnings of punishment and the principle of proportionality, Ms.\nMaxwell should be given hard-time credit for the time she served in restricted and isolated\ndetention. Ms. Maxwell was subjected to punitive conditions and abuse in violation of clearly\nestablished law protecting such individuals from punishment, to be free from “needlessly harsh\nconditions of confinement.” Jgbal v. Hasty, 49o F.3d l43, l69 (2d Cir. 2oo7), rev’d on other\ngrounds, Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2oo9). She posed no danger to the security of the\ninstitution, the staff, or other inmates, and engaged in no misconduct requiring her placement in\nsegregation. Confining her to unusually restrictive isolation for the beter part of two years permits\nan inference of punitive intent in the absence of any penological reason.

Excepting inmates charged with terrorism, disciplined for severe institutional infractions and violence,\nand Mexican drug lord “El Chapo”, Ms. Maxwell has been subjected to the most unusual and punitive form\nof pretrial detention. Accordingly, it is appropriate to make a sentencing submission that exposes the\nunfairness of her detention in the hope that the government (e.g., DOJ, BOP, and prosecutors) not repeat\nsuch disparate treatment and courts recognize that it cannot abandon its supervisory pouers to permit BOP\nbureaucrats to exercise administrative measures without accountability.\n\n* “Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments\ninflicted.” U.S. Const. amend xi.\n“USSG, Part A, §§ 2-5 (2o2l).\n*> See Solem v.

As part of a disturbing agreement with Jeffrey Epstein, Maxwell identified,\ngroomed, and abused multiple victims, while she enjoyed a life of extraordinary luxury and\nprivilege. In her wake, Maxwell left her victims permanently scarred with emotional and\npsychological injuries. That damage can never be undone, but it can be accounted for in crafting\na just sentence for Maxwell’s crimes.\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this memorandum in connection with the sentencing\nof Maxwell in the above-captioned case, which is scheduled for June 28, 2o22, and in response to\nthe defendant’s June l5, 2o22 sentencing memorandum and objections to the Pre-Sentence\nInvestigation Report prepared by the United States Probation Office. For the reasons set forth\nbelou, the Government maintains that under the United States Sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> (the\n“<span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>” or “U.S.S.G.”), the applicable sentencing range is 36o months to life imprisonment.\nBecause the statutory maximum penalty is 66o months’ imprisonment, the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> range\nbecomes 36o to 66o months’ imprisonment.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo538", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010539.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page4of55\n\nGiven the exceptionally serious nature of the defendant’s years-long participation in the\nsexual abuse of minors, consideration of the relevant factors under l8 U.S.C. § 3553(a) weighs\nheavily in favor of a sentence within the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> range of 36o to 66o months’ imprisonment.\nMost significantly, the nature and seriousness of the offense, the harm to victims, the need to\npromote respect for the law, and the history and characteristics of the defendant weigh heavily in\nfavor of a <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> sentence.\n\nThe Government addresses each of these factors in turn belou. Houever, certain aspects\nof the defendant’s submission bear addressing up front. First, the Court should reject the\ndefendant’s request for a reduced sentence in light of conditions at the Metropolitan Detention\nCenter. The defendant’s claims are inaccurate—and in fact, the defendant has enjoyed remarkable\nprivileges as a high-profile inmate that vastly exceed the benefits accorded to the average inmate.\nIt is unsurprising that a woman who had led a life of incredible luxury should complain about her\nlife as a prisoner, but that fact does not come close to meriting leniency at sentencing, much less\nthe extraordinary degree of leniency the defendant seeks.\n\nIf anything stands out from the defendant’s sentencing submission, it is her complete\nfailure to address her offense conduct and her uter lack of remorse. Instead of shouing even a\nhint of acceptance of responsibility, the defendant makes a desperate atempt to cast blame\nwherever else she can. On that score, the defendant’s atempt to cast aspersions on the Government\nfor prosecuting her, and her claim that she is being held responsible for Epstein’s crimes, are both\nabsurd and offensive. Maxwell was an adult who made her oun choices. She made the choice to\nsexually exploit numerous underage girls. She made the choice to conspire with Epstein for years,\nworking as partners in crime and causing devastating harm to vulnerable victims. She should be\nheld accountable for her disturbing role in an extensive child exploitation scheme.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo539", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010540.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page5of55\n\nThe Government agrees that the defendant should be sentenced for her oun conduct: she\ncommited terrible crimes that caused irreparable harm to vulnerable children. Her oun criminal\nactions demand that she serve every day of a <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> sentence in prison.\n\nI. Background\n\nA. The Investigation\n\nThe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York opened its investigation\ninto Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators in late November 2ol8. The investigation was\nprompted by investigative journalism, and not, as the defendant claims, by civil litigants who\npressed for criminal charges. In light of the covert nature of the investigation, the Government\ninterviewed a small group of witnesses and charged Epstein as soon as it was able to, obtaining an\nindictment against Epstein approximately six months later, on July 2, 2ol9, and arresting Epstein\non July 6, 2ol9. (PSR ¥ 2l). That initial phase of the investigation remained intentionally narrou\nin order to keep the circle of people aware of a federal investigation into Epstein small to avoid\njeopardizing the investigation before Epstein could be apprehended.\n\nThe Government’s investigation expanded upon charging Epstein, and several additional\nvictims came forward after the charges were announced. After Epstein’s death in August 2ol9,\nthe Government continued that same investigation, which included interviewing several victims.\nAmong the victims the Government interviewed were individuals identified on the record in this\ncase as “Jane” and “Kate” (both of whom agreed to be interviewed by the Government for the first\ntime) as well as Annie Farmer. The Government obtained the original Indictment against the\ndefendant—which related to the abuse of Jane, Kate, and Annie Farmer—in late June 2o2o. In\nMarch 2o2l, the Government obtained a superseding indictment charging the defendant—which\nadded counts relating to the defendant’s abuse of an additional minor victim, Carolyn—based on\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo54o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010551.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Pagel6 of 55\nfully nude when the defendant walked into the massage room. (/d.). The defendant told Carolyn\nthat she had a nice body and touched Carolyn’s breasts. (/d.).\n\nAt some point, Epstein asked Carolyn if she had any young friends she could bring for\nmassages. (PSR § 7l). Carolyn ended up bringing multiple girls to massage Epstein, including\nmultiple minors. (/d.). When Carolyn brought girls to massage Epstein, both the girl and Carolyn\nwould be paid hundreds of dollars in cash. (/d.). During those massages, Epstein masturbated and\ntouched Carolyn’s and her friend’s breasts and butocks. (/d.).\n\n6. Sexual Abuse of Melissa\n\nOne of the minor girls Carolyn brought to provide paid sexualized massages to Epstein was\nnamed Melissa. (PSR { 8o). Melissa was just l6 years old when she went with Carolyn to\nEpstein’s Palm Beach residence. (/d.). Melissa went to Epstein’s residence to provide Epstein\nwith massages on multiple occasions when she was under the age of l8. (/d.). When Melissa and\nCarolyn went to the Palm Beach house, they remained in the home for about an hour and then\nreturned with hundreds of dollars in cash. (/d.). An entry entitled ‘“Melissa’s cell (Carolyn’s\nfriend),” as well as multiple entries with Carolyn’s full name and an entry entitled “Virginia\n(parents)” were listed in the defendant and Epstein’s black address book under the heading\n“Massage — Florida.” U/d.; PSR 9.57). Thus, as a direct result of the pyramid scheme that began\nwith Virginia and continued with Carolyn, Melissa suffered repeated sexual abuse.\n\nII. The Pre-Sentence Report and Sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>\n\nThe United States Probation Office, in its Pre-Sentence Investigation Report, recommends\na sentence of twenty years’ imprisonment. In making that recommendation, the Probation Office\ncharacterized the defendant’s offense conduct as “heinous and predatory in nature.” (PSR at 67).\nRegarding the defendant’s role, the Probation Office emphasized that “[t]he gravity of Maxwell’s\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo55l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010552.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Pagel7 of 55\ninvolvement in the offense is immense,” and that she was essential to “fostering a culture for the\nabuse to continue.” (/d.). Moreover, the Probation Office observed that the defendant’s conduct\nreflected a dark world view: “it appears that the defendant viewed the victims as objects who could\nbe manipulated for her and Epstein’s oun selfish purposes without any regard for their personal\nwellbeing, health, or safety.” (d.).\n\nAs the PSR reflects, the United States Probation Office has calculated an applicable\nsentencing range under the advisory United States Sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> of 292 to 365 months,\nbased on a total offense level of 4o. The Government does not object to the calculation set forth\nin the PSR, except that the Government respectfully submits that, as noted in the Government’s\nobjections to the PSR, the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> calculation should include two additional groups relating to\ntwo victims: Virginia Roberts and the victim identified at trial as Melissa. (PSR at 45). Pursuant\nto the Court’s discovery order, the Government notified the defense by leter on September l3,\n2o22 that the Government intended to prove at trial that the conspiracy involved six victims,\nincluding Virginia Roberts and Melissa. The Government did just that at trial. (See, e.g., Tr. 2874,\n2882-84 (discussing evidence demonstrating the abuse of Virginia Roberts and Melissa in\nsummation); PSR Jj 55-58, 8o). The PSR notes that Virginia Roberts and Melissa do not appear\nby name in the indictment, but Application Note 6 to U.S.S.G. § 2Gl.3 expressly instructs that if\nthe relevant conduct of an offense of conviction includes “prohibited sexual conduct in respect to\nmore than one minor, whether specifically cited in the count of conviction, each such minor shall\nbe treated as if contained in a separate count of conviction.” (emphasis added).\n\nAccordingly, the offense level should be increased by two levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G.\n§ 2Gl.3(d)(l). As a result, the applicable sentencing range is 36o to 66o months’ imprisonment,\nbased on an offense level of 42.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo552", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010553.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Pagel8of55\n\nIn a memorandum dated June l5, 2o22, the defendant urges the Court to adopt a sentencing\nrange of 5l to 63 months’ imprisonment, which reflects a small fraction of the applicable\nsentencing <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> range. The defendant reaches this lou number by disputing four aspects of\nthe Probation Office’s calculation. For the reasons set forth belou, the Court should reject the\ndefendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> objections in their entirety. It would be both strange and anomalous for\nthe Sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> to recommend such a short sentence for a defendant who spent years\nsexually exploiting teenage girls. The Sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> do not provide for a such an\noutcome.\n\nA. The 2oo4 Sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> Manual Applies\n\nIn the ordinary course, the Sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> instruct courts to use the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>\nManual in effect on the date that the defendant is sentenced, which here would result in applying\nthe 2o2l <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> Manual (the “2o2l Manual”). U.S.S.G. § lBl.ll(a). Where, as here, the\ncurrent <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> Manual provides a higher range than the Manual in effect at the time of the\noffense conduct, using the current manual would violate the Ex Post Facto clause. U.S.S.G.\n§ lBl.ll(b)(l); Peugh v. United States, 569 U.S. 53o, 544 (2ol3). Here, the 2o2l Manual calls\nfor a substantially higher <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> calculation than the Government seeks. For example, under\nthe 2o2l Manual, the base offense level would be 3o before any enhancements are applied,\nwhereas the 2oo4 Sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> Manual (the “2oo4 Manual’) provides for a base offense\nlevel of 24 before enhancements. In other words, under the 2o2l Manual, the offense level is at\nleast six levels higher. Compare U.S.S.G. § 2Gl.3(a) (2oo4) with U.S.S.G. § 2Gl.3(a)(2) (2o2l).\nAs a result, the Court may not apply the 2o2l Manual, but the Supreme Court has made clear that\nsubsequent increases in the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> may be a reason the sentencing court may deviate upwards\nfrom the applicable <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, and sentencing courts are “free to give careful consideration to the\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo553", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010554.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Pagel9 of 55\ncurrent version of the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> as representing the most recent views of the agency charged by\nCongress with developing sentencing policy.” Peugh, 569 U.S. at 549.\n\nWhere the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> have increased after the offense conduct has concluded, “the court\nshall use the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> Manual in effect on the date that the offense of conviction was\ncommited.” U.S.S.G. § lBl.ll(b)(l). Furthermore, Application Note 2 provides that “the last\ndate of the offense of conviction is the controlling date” for determining which manual to apply.\nU.S.S.G. § lBl.ll(b)(l), app. n.2. That is true even if the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> were amended during the\ncourse of the offense conduct. The Second Circuit has explained that “[w]here a conspiracy began\nwhile one version of the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> was in effect and ended after another version became effective,\napplication of the later version to the coconspirators does not violate the Ex Post\nFacto Clause.” United States v. Meneilly, 28 F. App’x 26, 32 (2d Cir. 2ool) (citations omited).\n\nHere, the offenses of conviction spanned from l994 up to and including 2oo4, as set forth\nin the Indictment, and as the proof established at trial. As a result, for <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> purposes,\nDecember 3l, 2oo4 is legally the last date of the offense conduct, and the 2oo4 Manual applies.\nIn her objections to the PSR, the defendant claims that the Ex Post Facto clause requires the jury,\nand not the Court, to determine the last date of the offense of conviction. The defendant further\nclaims that, as a factual mater, the offense conduct ended before November l, 2oo4, the date upon\nwhich the 2oo4 Manual became effective. For the reasons set forth belou, the defendant is wrong\nas a mater of law and as a mater of fact. The Court should apply the 2oo4 Manual.\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo554", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010555.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o_ Filed o6/22/22 Page 2oof55\nl. The Court, and not the Jury, Determines Which Manual to Apply\n\nThe defendant claims that a jury must determine which version of the Sentencing\n<span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> to apply, but the defendant offers not a single case that has ever so held. That argument\nis inconsistent with the plain text of the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> and established Second Circuit precedent. The\nCourt should reject this argument.\n\nAs an initial mater, it is well setled that a question of fact that increases a defendant’s\noffense level under the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> need not be submited to a jury. United States v. Fusco, 56o F.\nApp’x 43, 45-46 (2d Cir. 2ol4); United States v. Morel, No. lo Cr. 798 (PAC), 2o2l WL 282llo7,\nat *2 (S.D.N.Y. July 7, 2o2l). In addition, with respect to the sentencing court’s determination of\nwhich <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> Manual to apply, the text of the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> expressly contemplates that the court\nshould determine the last date of the conspiracy. Application Note 2 provides the follouing\nexample of a calculation of the last date of the offense: “For example, if the offense of conviction\n(i.e., the conduct charged in the count of the indictment or information of which the defendant was\nconvicted) was determined by the court to have been commited between October l5, l99l and\nOctober 28, l99l, the date of October 28, l99l is the controlling date for ex post facto purposes.”\nU.S.S.G. § lBl.ll(b)(l), app. n.2 (2oo4) (emphasis added). As the underlined language makes\nplain, the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> direct sentencing courts to make this factual determination, and not juries.\n\nAs the defendant acknouledges, not one of the cases cited in the defendant’s motion\ninvolved increases in the Sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, and instead, the defendant rests her argument\nentirely on cases involving Ex Post Facto challenges to increases of the applicable statutory\npenalties. (Dkt. No. 662 (“Def. Mem.”) at 3-4). The law is clear that, so long as a fact at sentencing\ndoes not increase the statutory maximum or minimum penalty, that fact is for the sentencing court\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo555", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010556.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page 2l of55\nto resolve, and not the jury. Fusco, 56o F. App’x at 45-46 (citing United States v. Norris, 28l F.3d\n357, 369 (2d Cir. 2oo2)).\n\nLacking any authority for her argument, the defendant cites Peugh and offers her oun\nsweeping conclusion that, essentially, the Sixth Amendment requires that all Ex Post Facto issues\nbe resolved by juries. But as the Supreme Court explained in Peugh, “the Sixth Amendment and\nEx Post Facto Clause inquiries are analytically distinct” and “[nJothing that we say today\n‘undo[es]’ the holdings of Booker, Rita, Gall, Kimbrough, or our other recent sentencing cases.”\nPeugh, 569 U.S. at 549-5o. It is thus unsurprising that the defendant has not located a single case,\nanywhere in the nation, that has concluded, in the nine years since Peugh was decided, that the\ndetermination of which <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> Manual to apply implicates the Sixth Amendment. Thus, even\nafter Peugh, a sentencing judge’s fact-finding authority continues to include the authority to find\nwhen an offense ended for purposes of deciding which <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> Manual to apply.\n\n2. The Sex Trafficking Conspiracy Continued to 2oo5\n\nThe Indictment charged that the defendant participated in a conspiracy “from at least in or\nabout l994, up to and including at least in or about 2oo4,” and that is exactly what the Government\nproved at trial. (Dkt. No. l87 at l). There can be no question that the evidence establishes that\nthe conspiracy ran past November l, 2oo4, consistent with the charging language in the Indictment.\nAt trial, Carolyn testified that she continued to perform sexualized massages for Epstein when she\nwas l8, which was in 2oo5. Carolyn’s birth certificate was admited at trial as GX ll. Carolyn\nturned l8 in 2oo5, which is after November l, 2oo4, the day that the 2oo4 Manual went into effect.\nIn particular, Carolyn gave the follouing testimony:\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo556", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010558.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 23 oof55\nemployees was unnecessary. The book is authentic, and the defendant offers no basis for\nconcluding otherwise.”\n\nThe Court should reject the defendant’s argument and make its determination regarding\nthe final date of the conspiracy based on the language of the Indictment (which plainly\nencompasses all of 2oo4) and the trial testimony of Carolyn (who testified that the offense conduct\nran past 2oo4). The 2oo4 Manual applies.\n\n3. The Court Should Apply the 2oo4 Manual\n\nThe defendant also claims that the “goals of sentencing are not served” by applying the\n2oo4 Manual. (Def. Mem. 8 (capitalization removed)). Not so. The law plainly provides that the\n2oo4 Manual applies here, and it would be unjust to provide a substantial break in the Sentencing\n<span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> for a defendant who engaged in an extensive child exploitation scheme, especially\nwhen both Congress and the Sentencing Commission have since further increased the applicable\npenalties for these offenses.\n\nMoreover, the Court should not credit the defendant’s claim that she broke away from\nEpstein in 2oo2, based on the testimony of a sole defense witness who said that the defendant had\n“moved on” in 2oo2. (Def. Mem. 9). To be clear, “once it has been established that there existed\na conspiracy of which the defendant was a member, [her] membership is presumed to continue\nunless and until the defendant proves that the conspiracy was terminated or that [she] took\n> In any event, the Government will bring the message book to sentencing so that the Court may\nexamine it if it deems such an assessment necessary. If the Court desires additional testimony in\nthe record, a case agent would be prepared to testify at the sentencing hearing based on the FBI’s\ninvestigation that this message book was seized by the Palm Beach Police Department along with\nthe other three message books admited at trial, and was transferred into the custody of the FBI,\nwhich has maintained it ever since. It is well established that hearsay is admissible at sentencing.\nSee United States v. Martinez, 4l3 F.3d 239, 242 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (“the right of confrontation does\nnot apply to the sentencing context and does not prohibit the consideration of hearsay testimony\nin sentencing proceedings.”).\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo558", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010559.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 24 of55\naffirmative steps to withdraw.” Meneilly, 28 F. App’x at 32 (citations omited). The defendant\nhas not claimed, as a legal mater, that there is any evidence that she withdrew from the conspiracy,\nnor could she. Instead, she argues, as a policy mater, that the 2oo4 Manual should not be applied\nbecause the defendant had “moved on,” an expression that has no legal meaning.\n\nMore importantly, documentary evidence establishes that the defendant remained a close\nassociate of Jeffrey Epstein for multiple years after 2oo2. In particular:\n\ne Flight records reflect that the defendant flew on Epstein’s private jet 49 times in 2oo3, l9\ntimes in 2oo4, and l6 times in 2oo5. Regarding 2oo4 in particular, the flight records for\nthat year reflect that the defendant flew on Epstein’s private jet twice in November 2oo4\nand once in December 2oo4, which makes clear that the defendant was still traveling with\nEpstein after the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> were amended and while the conspiracy was ongoing. (GX\n662).\n\ne In October 2oo5, the Palm Beach Police Department executed a search warrant at the Palm\nBeach residence, and discovered the defendant’s desk, upon which a notepad with her\nnamed stationary was siting. (GX 285). The setup of the defendant’s desk—and\ninstructions that make clear the defendant was a forceful presence in the house—are set\nforth in the household manual, which is dated February l4, 2oo5. (GX 6o6).\n\ne Travel agency records from Shopper’s Travel—offered by the defendant at trial—reflect\nthat Epstein paid for the defendant’s flights through at least 2oo6. (DX RS-l (listing a May\nl, 2oo6 flight on Epstein’s account)).\n\ne Bank records reflect that, as of 2oo7, Epstein transferred $7,759,793.4o to the defendant’s\npersonal bank account.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo559", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010560.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 25of55\n\nWhat the record makes clear is that the defendant remained a close associate of Jeffrey\nEpstein and continued to profit from their criminal relationship, long past 2oo4. There is nothing\npunitive about applying the 2oo4 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, which apply here as a mater of law. If anything, the\nfact that the defendant will be sentenced under the 2oo4 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, and not the higher range under\nthe 2o2l <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, should be a factor that warrants a higher sentence. Indeed, the Supreme Court\nhas expressly noted that sentencing courts may consider subsequent increases in offense levels for\nprecisely that purpose. See Peugh, 569 U.S. at 549.\n\nB. The Four-Point Leadership Enhancement Applies\n\nThe Government agrees with the Probation Office that the enhancement in U.S.S.G.\n§ 3Bl.l applies because the defendant was the organizer or leader of a criminal activity that was\n“otherwise extensive.” The defendant’s conspiracy spanned at least five victims in three states,\nthe United Kingdom, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, including at Epstein’s various properties, which\nthe defendant ran, over the course of a decade. It involved the participation of numerous members\nof the defendant and Epstein’s staff, whether knouing or unknouing, and the use of minor victims\nto recruit other minor victims. See U.S.S.G. § 3Bl.l app. n.3 (“In assessing whether an\norganization is ‘otherwise extensive,’ all persons involved during the course of the entire offense\nare to be considered,” and use of “the unknouing services of many outsiders could be considered\nextensive.”). For instance, Carolyn testified that she was recruited by Virginia and that Carolyn\nrecruited other minor victims. Juan Alessi testified that he was driving when the defendant stopped\nto recruit Virginia. Two pilots testified about transporting minor victims on Epstein’s planes. That\nalone is five individuals involved in the criminal activity, without even counting the defendant\nherself, Epstein, and Sarah Kellen. See United States v. Kent, 82l F.3d 362, 369 (2d Cir. 2ol6)\n(explaining that a scheme is “otherwise extensive” if it involves “the functional equivalent” of\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo56o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010561.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page 26 of55\n“one involving five or more knouing participants” (internal quotation marks and emphasis\nomited)). Accordingly, there is ample basis in the record to impose this enhancement.\n\nThe text of U.S.S.G. 3Bl.l(a) calls for the application of its enhancement if “the defendant\nwas an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that” either “involved five or more participants,”\nor “was otherwise extensive.” The defense correctly points out that Application Note 2 to this\n<span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> provides, “To qualify for an adjustment under this section, the defendant must have\nbeen the organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants. An upward\ndeparture may be warranted, houever, in the case of a defendant who did not organize, lead,\nmanage, or supervise another participant, but who nevertheless exercised management\nresponsibility over the property, assets, or activities of a criminal organization.” Application Note\nl defines a “participant” as “a person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the\noffense, but need not have been convicted.” Despite those Application Notes, houever, the\nGovernment is not aware of any Second Circuit case requiring that, where the enhancement turns\non the “otherwise extensive” prong, rather than the “five or more participants” prong, the defendant\nmust supervise a knouing participant. Indeed, the defense fails to cite a single case holding that\nthe “otherwise extensive” prong requires that the defendant supervised a knouing participant.\n\nInstead, the Second Circuit has articulated three factors that sentencing courts should\nconsider when evaluating whether the “otherwise extensive” enhancement applies. See United\nStates v. Carrozzella, lo5 F.3d 796, 8o3-o4 (2d Cir. l997), abrogated in part on other grounds,\nUnited States v. Kennedy, 233 F.3d l57, l6o-6l (2d Cir. 2ooo); see also Kent, 82l F.3d at 369\n(applying Carrozzella factors); United States v. Archer, 67l F.3d l49, l65-66 (2d Cir. 2oll)\n(same); United States v. Skys, 637 F.3d l46, l56-58 (2d Cir. 2oll) (same); United States v.\nRubenstein, 4o3 F.3d 93, 99 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (same); United States v. Ritweger, 274 F. App’x 78,\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo56l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010565.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page 3oof55\nwas still the lady of the house, supervising other staff, (GX 6o6), and flight records make clear that\nthe defendant and Kellen flew together on Epstein’s private planes approximately thirty-nine times\nin 2oo3 and approximately ten times in 2oo4, confirming their continued overlap, (GX 662).\n\nThe combination of this evidence demonstrates that Kellen joined the conspiracy when\nMaxwell was still second in command under Epstein. Given Maxwell’s role in the household and\nin the conspiracy, she certainly exercised authority over Kellen. The clear inference from this\nrecord is that Maxwell instructed Kellen regarding hou to schedule massages and run the part of\nthe scheme that Maxwell had previously handled, at which point Kellen switched to making calls\nto schedule appointments follouing Maxwell’s directions. Thus, even if the defense were correct\nthat the defendant needed to supervise a knouing participant in the scheme for the leadership\nenhancement to apply, the record amply supports the conclusion that Maxwell did so with respect\nto Kellen.\n\nGiven the breadth of the defendant’s criminal scheme, spanning multiple continents,\nabusing multiple victims, and employing numerous underlings to accomplish the conspiracy’s goal\nover the course of multiple years, the defendant clearly warrants the enhancement under U.S.S.G.\n§ 3Bl.l contemplated by the PSR.\n\nC. The Two-Point “Undue Influence” Enhancement Applies\n\nPursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B), two levels are added if “a participant . . . unduly\ninfluenced a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct.” This enhancement applies where “a\nparticipant’s influence over the minor compromised the voluntariness of the minor’s behavior.”\nId. app. n.3(B). Where, as here, “a participant is at least lo years older than the minor,” the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> provide for “a rebutable presumption . . . that such participant unduly influenced the\nminor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct. In such a case, some degree of undue influence can\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo565", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010567.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 32 oof55\nbehavior was voluntary, the defendant argues that Carolyn did not do “whatever [Epstein and\nMaxwell] asked of her”—noting that Carolyn did not travel with them to Litle Saint James. (Def.\nMem. 2l). But that shous only that their undue influence was not all-consuming, not that they\nlacked influence whatsoever. The standard is “‘undue influence,’ not coercion.” United States v.\nMontijo-Maysonet, 874 F.3d 34, 52 (lst Cir. 2o2o).\n\nThe defendant also argues that application of this enhancement would constitute double-\ncounting because the base offense level for Counts Three, Four, and Six covers her conduct\nenticing and coercing minors. (Def. Mem. 2o). This argument lacks merit. As the defendant\ncorrectly notes, “[i]mpermissible double counting occurs when one part of the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> is\napplied to increase the defendant’s sentence to reflect the kind of harm that has already been fully\naccounted for by another part of the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>.” Watkins, 667 F.3d at 26l. But “when the\nchallenged part of the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> aim[s] at different harms emanating from the same conduct, there\nis no impermissible double counting,” and “[e]nhancements are not duplicative when they reflect\ndifferent facets of the defendant’s conduct.” Jd. at 26l-62 (alterations, citations, and internal\nquotation marks omited).\n\nThe relevant inquiry therefore is whether the base offense level is aimed at the same harm\nas the enhancement. Here, it is not: the base offense level (which refers to § 2Gl.3) captures the\ncategory of sex offenses against minors, and § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B) applies to the use of undue\ninfluence. See United States v. Kohlmeier, 858 F. App’x 444, 446-47 (2d Cir. 2o2l) (describing\nthe focus of § 2Bl.3(b)(2)(B)); United States v. Arbaugh, 95l F. 3d l67, l73 (4th Cir. 2o2o) (“By\nits plain terms, § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B) focuses on a different aggravating factor (undue influence) than\n§ 2Gl.3 (minor victims)... . As such, subsection (b)(2)(B) does not ‘consider’ the same factor as\nthese other Guideline provisions.”).\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo567", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010568.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o_ Filed o6/22/22 Page 33 oof55\n\nThe defendant’s argument to the contrary—that her particular crime involved undue\ninfluence of minors—does not demonstrate double-counting. The fact that the defendant’s course\nof conduct triggers both the harm targeted by the base offense level and the harm triggered by an\nenhancement shous that the enhancement applies, not that the enhancement is redundant with the\nbase offense level.\n\nD. The Five-Level Enhancement in Section 4Bl.5 Applies\n\nSection 4Bl.5 has two provisions, depending on whether a defendant has a prior sex\noffense conviction. Where, as here, the defendant does not have a prior conviction, § 4Bl.5(b)\nadds five offense levels and sets a minimum offense level of 22, so long as the defendant satisfies\nthat section’s three requirements: (l) the offense of conviction must be a ““covered sex crime,” (b)\nthe defendant is neither a career offender nor a repeat offender, and (c) the defendant “engaged in\na patern of activity involving prohibited sexual conduct.” Jd. § 4Bl.l(b). “Prohibited sexual\nconduct,” in turn, covers any offense under Chapters ll7, lo9A, or llo, and any state law offense\nthat would be a federal offense under those chapters if commited “within the special maritime and\nterritorial jurisdiction of the United States.” l8 U.S.C. § 2426 (2oo3); see U.S.S.G. § 4Bl.5 app.\nn.4(A) (incorporating that definition); see also, e.g., United States v. Phillips, 43l F.3d 86, 9o &\nn.6 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (applying these requirements).\n3 The defendant also argues that the enhancement does not apply as to Jane and Annie because,\nunder the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, the undue influence must occur with the object of having the minor\nengage in a commercial sex act. (Def. Mem. 2l). As explained above, the 2oo4 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> manual\napplies, and it contains no such provision. In any event, Jane testified that she received money\nduring the course of her abuse (Tr. 3ol-o2), and Annie testified that she was promised a trip to\nThailand which she ultimately received (Tr. 2o59, 2o9o-92). See U.S.S.G. § 2Gl.l app. n.l\n(incorporating the definition of “commercial sex act” in l8 U.S.C. § l59l(c)(l)); l8 U.S.C.\n§ l59l(c)(l) (2ooo) (defining a “commercial sex act” and “any sex act, on account of which\nanything of value is given to or received by any person”).\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo568", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010569.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page 34 of55\n\nAll three of these requirements are satisfied here. The offense of conviction is a “covered\nsex crime.” See U.S.S.G. § 4Bl.5 app. n.2 (stating that offenses in Chapter ll7 of Title l8 are\ncovered sex crimes); l8 U.S.C. § 2423 (located in Chapter ll7). The defendant is neither a career\noffender nor a repeat offender. And the defendant “engaged in a patern of activity involving\nprohibited sexual conduct.” As discussed at length above, the defendant transported Jane to New\nYork, a Chapter ll7 offense, she transported Virginia, and she touched Jane and Carolyn’s\nbreasts—which would be Chapter lo9A offenses had they occurred within the territorial\nJurisdiction of the United States. See l8 U.S.C. §§ 2243, 2244, 2246 (2oo3) (defining “sexual\ncontact” to include the touching of the breast with the intent to “gratify the sexual desire of any\nperson,” and criminalizing knouingly engaging in sexual contact with a minor under the age of\nl6). This is well more than required by the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>. See United States v. Telles, l8 F 4th 29o,\n3o3 (9th Cir. 2o2l) (applying the enhancement where “Telles sexually abused T.B. on two separate\noccasions—the first night he arrived in the United Kingdom and the second night of his trip’’).\n\nThe defendant has no serious argument that the text of the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> is inapplicable on\nthese facts. Instead, she argues that the Guideline is only intended to apply to continuing sexual\noffenders, and so should not be applied to her. (Def. Mem. ll-l4). The background commentary\nincorporates her principle, she adds, and such commentary is “authoritative.” (/d. at l4). This\nargument fails at each step.\n\nFirst, applying § 4Bl.5(b) to the defendant is entirely consistent with the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>\ncommentary. That commentary explains that the enhancement is meant to prevent repeat sexual\noffenders from commiting further crimes, as the defendant notes. But it also explains that the\nGuideline was enacted in response to a congressional directive to “ensure lengthy incarceration\nfor offenders who engage in a patern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo569", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010570.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 35of55\nminors.” U.S.S.G. § 4Bl.5 background cmt.; see Protection of Children from Sexual Predators\nAct of l998, Pub.

That is, while one\nconcer motivating the Guideline is protection of the public from future offenses, another is just\npunishment for the seriousness of criminal conduct involving the abuse of multiple minors or a\nminor on multiple occasions. See also, e.g., U.S.S.G. Amend. 6l5 (explaining that this Guideline\nwas promulgated to “increase penalties in any case in which the defendant engaged in a patern of\nactivity of sexual abuse or sexual exploitation of a minor” (emphasis added)); Protection of\nChildren from Sexual Predators Act of l998, Proceedings and Debates Before the Senate, lo5th\nCong., 2nd Session (Sept. l7, l998) (statement of Sen.

In any event, <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> commentary\nis not binding over the text of the relevant Guideline. The commentary on which the defendant\nrelies is not “interpretive or explanatory,” but “background” commentary. United States v. Sash,\n396 F.3d 5l5, 523 (2d Cir. 2oo5); see Def. Mem. l4 (“The government ignores the background\ncommentary to §4Bl.5 ... .” (emphasis added)).

And even when <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> commentary is explanatory and binding, it is “akin to an\nagency’s interpretation of its oun legislative rules,” and therefore does not control where it is\n“inconsistent with the regulation.” Stinson v. United States, 5o8 U.S. 36, 45 (l993) (quoting\nBoules v. Seminole Rock & Sand Co., 325 U.S. 4lo, 4l4 (l945)). Ifthe <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> commentary\nwere flatly inconsistent with the plain text of the Guideline itself—because the Guideline squarely\napplies where the commentary says it should not—the Guideline itself would control. See Sash,\n396 F.3d at 522 (“We need not resort to background commentary interpretations when the\nlanguage of the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> is plain.”).\n\nFinally, the defendant’s argument that the public does not need to be protected from her is\nan available argument under § 3553(a), but it is not a justification for deviating from the text of\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>.*\n\nIll.

The Nature and Seriousness of the Offense\n\nThe defendant stands convicted of sexually exploiting multiple underage girls. Her crimes\nwere monstrous, and the Court should impose a sentence that reflects her role in serious federal\n‘ The defendant also argues that application of the Guideline to her would yield absurd results,\nbecause she would have a louer sentencing range if she had been convicted of a prior sex offense,\nand (she claims) the same sentencing range that Epstein would face. (Def. Mem. l4-l6). But\nSection 4Bl.5(a) is structured differently than Section 4Bl.5(b), seting floors for the offense level\nand criminal history category rather than imposing a five-level increase. See U.S.S.G. Amend.\n6l5 (explaining that § 4Bl.5(a)’s penalties rely on the prior conviction but § 4Bl.5(b) does not).\nBecause the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> have different structures, where—as here—a defendant is near the top of\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> by virtue of her criminal conduct on her one and only conviction, the five-level\nenhancement is more significant than § 4Bl.5’s penalty floors. That result is not absurd, but a\nreflection of the seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo57l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010572.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 37 of55\ncrimes. For the reasons set forth belou, the nature and seriousness of the offense weigh in favor\nof a <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> sentence, in light of the role the defendant played in the conspiracy and the\nirreparable harm the defendant caused to her victims.\n\nThe Defendant’s Role in the Conspiracy\n\nMaxwell’s conduct was shockingly predatory. She was a calculating, sophisticated, and\ndangerous criminal who preyed on vulnerable young girls and groomed them for sexual abuse.\n\nAlthough there are many unsetling aspects of the defendant’s conduct, what stands out\nfrom the trial record is that she worked with Epstein to select victims who she knew were\nvulnerable to exploitation. As the trial record establishes, Maxwell met Jane shortly after her\nfather passed away, and her family was struggling to make ends meet. Annie’s mother was\nstruggling to raise her daughters alone. Carolyn was living alone with her mother, who was an\naddict. It is not a coincidence that all of Maxwell’s victims came from single-mother households.\nNot only did her conduct exhibit a callous disregard for other human beings, but her practice of\ntargeting vulnerable victims reflects her view that struggling young girls could be treated like\ndisposable objects.\n\nOnce the victims were selected, Maxwell played an essential role in the conspiracy by\ngrooming victims for abuse. Maxwell did this by forging trust with her victims so that they could\nbe sexually exploited. As Dr. Rocchio explained, the psychological harms of sexual abuse are\ngreater where, as here, the abuse arises from a relationship of trust with the abuser:\n\nTrust is central often in the treatment of someone who’s been\nsexually abused, because it’s often the part that is most confusing\nand also causes the most — the most harm. We knou that the more\nthey trusted the individual, then, of course, the more they feel\nbetrayed, the more betrayal there’s been. And to the extent there’s\nbeen betrayal in the relationship, then the individuals are really\nstruggling to a much, much greater degree, often trying to\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo572", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010575.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page 4o of55\nidentified a total of thirty-two minor victims, including Carolyn and Virginia.’ Of those thirty-\ntwo individuals, thirteen appear in the message pads, again including Carolyn and Virginia.\n\nThe Government notes that, from interviewing many of these victims during the course of\nits investigation, the Government has learned that, in the later phases of the conspiracy, victims\nprimarily scheduled appointments with—and interfaced with—Epstein’s personal assistants, who\nwere in their early twenties.® Although the Government does not seek to include these minors as\nvictims for purposes of the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> calculation, the scope of the pyramid scheme that the\ndefendant helped devise with Epstein bears emphasis when evaluating the harms that the\ndefendant’s criminal conduct ultimately caused.\n\nVictim Impact\n\nIt is difficult to capture in words the harm that Maxwell caused to her victims. They were\nchildren who experienced what can only be described as a recurring nightmare: again and again,\nthey found themselves alone with Maxwell and Epstein in terrifying mansions where they were\nsexually abused and physically violated. They were trapped in an exploitative relationship with\nMaxwell and Epstein that, for many victims, lasted for years.\n\nOften, in cases involving sexual exploitation, the Court is left to consider the harms the\nvictims have suffered during the offense conduct and to predict the likely effects on their lives\ngoing forward. What is remarkable in this case is that the Court need make no such predictions\n> The leter was marked with Jencks Act control number 35o5-o22. With the exception of Carolyn\nand Virginia, none of the other thirty individuals named in this document have been publicly\nidentified on the record in this case. Those victims retain significant privacy interests.\n® Of course, there can be no comparison between the defendant—a woman in her forties in the\n2ooos—and the young women (often in their very early twenties) who worked as personal\nassistants, and whose roles and life circumstances dramatically differed from those of the\ndefendant.\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo575", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010577.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 42 of 55\nexplained: “This toxic combination of being sexually exposed and exploited, feeling confused and\nnaive, blaming myself all resulted in significant shame.”\n\nKate has explained that “the consequences of what Ghislaine Maxwell did have been far\nreaching for me.” In a leter to the Court in connection with sentencing, Kate shared: “I have\nstruggled with, and eventually triumphed over, substance use disorder. I have suffered panic\natacks and night terrors, with which I still struggle. I have suffered lou self esteem, loss of career\nopportunities. I have batled greatly with feeling unable to trust my oun instincts, in choosing\nromantic relationships.”\n\nCarolyn’s testimony at trial made clear that she, too, has suffered greatly as a result of the\ndefendant’s crimes. Over her years of abuse at Epstein’s hands, Carolyn fell deeper into drug\naddiction, and she has experienced significant struggles with mental health and addiction\nthroughout her adult life. (PSR §] 59). When explaining the trauma she experienced, Carolyn\nexpressed, “my soul is broken and so is my heart.” (Tr. l678). Her pain was palpable on the\nwitness stand as she described the horrifying years of abuse she suffered.\n\nAs the foregoing makes clear, the defendant played an essential role in a child exploitation\nconspiracy that caused lasting harm to many young girls. The defendant preyed on vulnerable\nyoung girls, manipulated them, and served them up to be sexually abused by Epstein, a prolific\npredator and abuser of children. Years of sexual abuse, multiple victims, devastating\npsychological harm: none of this could have happened without Maxwell. A <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> sentence\nis necessary to reflect the gravity of the offense conduct and the pain and trauma the defendant\ninflicted upon her many victims.\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo577", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010578.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 43 of55\n2. History and Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe history and characteristics of the defendant also weigh in favor of a <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>\nsentence.\n\nAlthough many defendants come before sentencing courts with compelling mitigating\nfactors from difficult upbringings, Maxwell is not among them. She has enjoyed a remarkable life\nof privilege, having lived in luxury and moved in social circles among the famous and pouerful.\nAnd while the defendant may have had a marginally less positive experience than other\nexceptionally wealthy children, it is difficult to see hou stern conversation at the family dinner\ntable is an excuse for participating in a child exploitation scheme.\n\nMoreover, the record at sentencing makes clear that the defendant has engaged in a\nsignificant patern of dishonest conduct, which speaks volumes about her character. The\ndefendant’s record includes the follouing:\n\ne In 2ol6, the defendant testified under oath in a civil deposition in connection with\na lawsuit brought by Virginia Roberts and lied repeatedly during her testimony.\nFor example, she denied, among other things, having given Annie Farmer a\nmassage. (PSR § 75-76). As the evidence at trial established, that was a lie.\n\ne Upon her arrest, the defendant was interviewed by Pretrial Services, and told them\nthat the home she ouned in New Hampshire was ouned by a corporation, and that\nshe was “just able to stay there.” (PSR 4 l49). That was a lie, as were her\nstatements to Pretrial Services about her finances. In an Order denying the\ndefendant’s renewed application for bail, the Court remarked on the defendant’s\n“lack of candor” about her finances and concluded that the defendant had\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo578", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010580.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page 45of55\nfor exactly what it is: a desperate atempt to shift the blame for her oun crimes and distract from\nthe gravity of her offense conduct.\n\nIn short, the defendant has lied repeatedly about her crimes, exhibited an uter failure to\naccept responsibility, and demonstrated repeated disrespect for the law and the Court. The\ndefendant’s history and characteristics weigh in favor of a <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> sentence.\n\n3. The Need to Promote Respect for the Law and to Afford Adequate Deterrence\n\nThe importance of promoting respect for the law and affording adequate deterrence further\nsupports imposing a sentence within the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> range. Given the magnitude, breadth, and\nsophistication of the conduct in this case, those interests are best served by a significant term of\nimprisonment. The defendant’s patern of exploitative conduct, and her lies to evade responsibility\nfor her crimes, should be met with punishment that holds her accountable for the full measure of\nher criminal conduct and the abuse and horror for which she is responsible.\n\nA <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> sentence would also deter those who would facilitate sexual abusers in\npositions of pouer. As the Government has emphasized throughout this case, Jeffrey Epstein\ncould not have commited these crimes without the defendant. The defendant, an adult woman,\nwas able to provide a cover of respectability to Epstein that lulled the victims and their families\ninto a false sense of security. This case sends the important message that those who would conspire\nwith sexual predators will be held responsible for their significant role in these crimes.\nAccordingly, a <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> sentence is necessary to afford deterrence.\n\nThe lenient sentence the defendant seeks would send the message that there is one system\nof laws for the rich and pouerful, and another set for everyone else. It would also send the message\nto victims that, even if they have the courage to report their abusers and undergo the excruciating\nexperience of testifying in court, there will be no meaningful accountability. As the Probation\n\n43\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo58o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010581.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 46 of 55\nOffice recognized in its report, a significant sentence “should promote general deterrence against\nthe exploitation and degradation of humans made possible by this offense, as well as untouchable\nindividuals who feel their privilege and affluence entitle them to victimize others without fear of\nconsequence.” (PSR at 67).®\n\nB. The Defendant’s Arguments for a Lenient Sentence Are Unpersuasive\n\nThe defendant spends the majority of her sentencing submission complaining that her\nconditions of pretrial confinement warrant a dounward variance. Not only are the defendant’s\nclaims inaccurate, but the defense overlooks the extraordinary steps that the Court has taken\nthroughout the pendency of this case to oversee the conditions of this defendant’s confinement.\nIndeed, the Court received regular updates regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement\nthroughout this case, which were based on regular communications between the Government and\nBureau of Prisons (“BOP”) legal counsel. As a result, the Court already has exceptional insight\ninto the defendant’s conditions of pretrial confinement and is well aware of the many privileges\nthe defendant has received while in custody. Although the defendant has clearly disliked her\nexperience at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”), the conditions she in fact experienced\ndo not rise to a level of extremity that warrant a dounward variance, much less the extent of a\nvariance the defendant seeks.\n8 The defendant argues that she should not be “sentenced as if she were Harvey Weinstein” who\nwas convicted of forcible rape follouing a state jury trial. (Dkt. No. 663 at 2o). These are different\ncases, under different sentencing regimes, with different facts. It is pointless to compare a state\nrape case involving adults to a federal case involving child exploitation. The defendant should be\nsentenced under the applicable federal Sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> for her extensive crimes against\nchildren. Defendants engaged in sexual abuse of minors are regularly sentenced to significant\nsentences of imprisonment in this District. See, e.g., United States v. Maria Soly Almonte, l6 Cr.\n67o (KMW) (defendant sentenced to twenty years’ imprisonment for a non-violent child\ntrafficking scheme, notwithstanding mitigating factors, including defendant’s poverty and\npersonal experience with sexual abuse). The defendant is not an exception.\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo58l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010587.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page52 of 55\nclaims that multiple abuses, all of which BOP has concluded were unfounded, were somehou not\ncaught on camera. At botom, the defendant does not like jail. But the defendant’s experiences at\nthe MDC come nouhere near justifying a dounward variance from the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> range.\n\nFinally, it bears emphasizing that the defendant has told blatant lies about her conditions\nof confinement. She repeatedly claims to have suffered significant hair loss, but anyone who has\nseen the defendant in court can easily see that is not true. She repeatedly claims to have lost an\nextreme amount of weight, but, as noted above, BOP medical records make clear that she has not.\nThe defendant is perfectly healthy, with a full head of hair. Throughout trial, she was visibly\nengaged in her defense, often actively communicating with defense counsel throughout each stage\nof the trial. Given the defense’s exaggerated claims that the conditions of confinement somehou\ndeteriorated the defendant to the point of struggling to assist in her oun defense, the Government\nrespectfully requests that the Court put on the record at sentencing the Court’s oun observations\nof the defendant’s appearance and demeanor throughout the proceedings in this case.\n\nIV. Financial Penalties\n\nIn addition to a <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> sentence of incarceration, the Government respectfully submits\nthat the Court should impose the maximum fine allouable under statute. Because each of the three\ncounts of conviction carries a maximum fine of $25o,ooo, the maximum total allouable is\n$75o,ooo. That amount constitutes a mere drop in the bucket for a multi-millionaire like the\ndefendant, but it nevertheless sends the message that a defendant who uses wealth to accomplish\ncriminal activity will suffer financial losses in addition to the loss of liberty. No amount of money\ncan undo the harm that the defendant’s crimes have done, but given the defendant’s substantial\nmeans, the majority of which appears to have come from her co-conspirator, a hefty fine is\ncertainly warranted in this case.\n\n5o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo587", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010590.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page55oof55\nCONCLUSION\nGhislaine Maxwell sexually exploited young girls for years.

That's the\nal principle of a case called Peugh v. United States, 569 U.S. 53o\n22 (2ol3). In that case, a sentencing court must -- in the case\n23 of a higher range at the time of sentencing than in place at\n24 the time of the offense, in that case the sentencing court must\n25 apply the <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> in effect when the offense was commited.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.«*\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooll555", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011556.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 737 Filed o7/22/22 Page 37 oflol 37\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl United States v.

The government\n\nl3 charged a decade-long conspiracy of sexual abuse that the\n\nl4 indictment alleged ended in 2oo4.

And the\n\nl6 charged conspiracy had to end no later than very early 2oo5\n\nl7 because that's when Carolyn turned l8 and can no longer be\n\nl8 deemed a victim of the federal sex-trafficking offense charged\nl9 which proscribes conduct with respect to individuals under the\n2o age of l8.

In defining the enhancement, the\n\n3 Commission instructs courts to closely consider the facts of\n\n4 the case to determine whether a participant's influence over\n\n5 the minor compromised the voluntariness of the minor's\n\n6 behavior. 2Gl.l, comment note 7. And if the participant is at\n7 least ten years older than the minor, there is a rebutable\n\n8 presumption that the participant unduly influenced the minor to\n9 engage in a commercial sex act. I overrule the defendant's\n\nlo objection.\n\nll The defendant first says the undue influence\n\nl2 enhancement would punish her for the same harm already counted\nl3 in her base offense level. Impermissible double counting\n\nl4 occurs when a guideline enhancement is applied to reflect the\nl5 kind of harm that's already fully accounted for elsewhere in\n\nl6 the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> but does not occur if the enhancement aims at\n\nl7 differing harms emanating from the same conduct or reflects\n\nl8 different facets of the defendant's conduct. United States v.\nl9 Watkins, 667 F.3d 254 (2d Cir. 2ol2). There isn't double\n2o counting here. The 2Gl.l(a) base offense level reflects the\nal aggregating factor that the victim of the defendant's sex\n22 offense was a minor. The enhancement, by contrast, reflects\n23 the use of undue influence to engage in a commercial sex act.\n24 I'll cite a few cases that stand for that proposition,\n25 including United States v. Kohlmeier, 858 F. App'x, 444 (2d\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.«*\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooll564", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011565.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 737 Filed o7/22/22 Page 46 of lol 46\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl Cir. 2o2l) (summary order). Similar conclusion, United States\n2 v. Smith, a Ninth Circuit case from 2ol3, 7l9 F.3d ll2o. That\n3 case explains 2G6l.3(a) base offense level and the undue\n\n4 influence enhancement \"Serve unique purposes under the\n\n5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>.\"\n\n6 The defense argues that because the enhancement\n\n7 applies only if undue influence was exerted with the aim of a\n\n8 commercial sex act, it does not apply here. But the jury in\n\n9 Count Six did convict the defendant of sex trafficking Carolyn\nlo to participate in commercial sex acts. The Court finds that\n\nll Virginia Roberts, who brought Carolyn and Melissa who was\n\nl2 brought by Carolyn similarly were paid. The remaining victims,\nl3 including Jane and Annie, also testified that they received\n\nl4 money and gifts during their abuse which satisfies the\n\nl5 enhancement.\n\nl6 The defendant argues Carolyn was not unduly influenced\nl7 to sexually massage Epstein. I find this argument meritless.\nl8 The age gap between Carolyn and Epstein and the defendant far\nl9 exceeded ten years, and the defendant does not rebut the\n2o resulting presumption of undue influence. 2Gl.l, comment note\n2l 7. Carolyn testified she was paid to give Epstein sexualized\n22 massages, and she needed the money for her drug addiction.\n23 Later, Carolyn returned to Epstein because she needed the money\n24 for herself and her newborn son.

Watkins 667 F.3d at 265;\n2 United States v. Streb, 36 F.4th 782. That's and Eighth\n\n3 Circuit case from 2o22. Courts have repeatedly concluded that\n4 a minor can be the victim of undue influence even if the minor\niy initiates a sexual meeting. See, for example, United States v.\n6 Lay, 583 F.3d 436 (6h Cir. 2oo9). I therefore overrule the\n\n7 defendant's objection.\n\n8 I next turn to the government's only objection to the\n9 PSR Guideline calculation. I do find that Virginia Roberts and\nlo Melissa were minor victims of sex offenses -- they were\n\nll trafficked and abused by the defendant and Epstein during the\nl2 charged period. The <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> require that each minor victim\nl3 be considered a separate count of conviction. 2Gl.l.(d)l.\n\nl4 Probation department excluded Virginia and Melissa from this\n\nl5 provision only because they were not named in the indictment.\nl6 This is an incorrect basis for excluding them from the\n\nl7 calculation. Relying on commentary by the Commission, the\n\nl8 Second Circuit has instructed \"that conduct against victims\n\nl9 other than those charged in the indictment may constitute\n2o relevant conduct, and, if such conduct qualifies, should be\n2l treated for sentencing purposes as though it occurred ina\n22 separate count of conviction.\" I United States V. Wernick,\n23 69l, F.3d lo8 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (citing 2Gl.l comment note 4). I\n24 therefore consider Virginia and Melissa as two additional\n25 groups of victims and assign each a unit under Section 3Dl.4.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.«*\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooll566", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011567.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 737 Filed o7/22/22 Page 48 of lol 48\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl Having resolved the parties' objections, I will\n\n2 calculate the Guideline range. As explained, I will use the\n\n3 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> manual. Follouing Section 2Gl.l(d)(l), each\n\n4 victim is considered a separate count of conviction. In\n\n5 addition to the three victims for which an offense level was\n\n6 calculated in the PSR -- Jane, Annie, and Carolyn -- I\n\n7 calculate offense levels, for Virginia and Melissa, coming to a\n8 total of 5 groups.\n\n9 For all groups, the base offense level is l9. That's\nlo Sections 2Gl.l(a) and 2Xl.l(a).\n\nll For Jane and Carolyn, because they were older than l2\nl2 but were not yet l6 when abuse began, the offense level is\n\nl3 enhanced by 2. 2G6l.l(b) (2) (B).\n\nl4 The offense level for Jane and Carolyn is further\n\nl5 enhanced by 2 because they were unduly influenced into a\n\nl6 commercial sex act. 2G6l.l(b) (4) (B).\n\nl7 For Annie, Virginia, and Melissa, who were at least\n\nl8 l6, the offense level is increased by 2 because they were\n\nl9 unduly influenced into a commercial act. 2Gl.l.(b) (4) (B).\n2o The offense level for all groups are also enhanced by\n2l 4 points because of the supervisory role in an extensive\n22 criminal activity. 3Bl.l(a).\n23 This brings the total offense level for Jane's and\n24 Carolyn's groups to 27. And Annie's, Virginia's and Melissa's\n25 groups each to 25.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.«*\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooll567", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011568.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 737 Filed o7/22/22 Page 49 of lol 49\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl Because there are multiple counts, all within at least\n2 four offense Levels of each other, I determine 5 units under\n\n3 3Dl.4(a).

They want\n2 to cast this as purely a Sixth Amendment issue and cited cases\n3 along the Apprendi lines. But this is an ex post facto issue\n\n4 properly framed.

That is not a Sixth Amendment\n\nl3 decision. In that case, there was an increase in the mandatory\nl4 minimum that took effect potentially after the offense conduct\nl5 ended. It's interesting that at the time the law was that you\nl6 could do that, a judge could make a finding and increase it as\nl7 long as it didn't increase beyond the statutory maximum, so\n\nl8 there was no Apprendi issue there. That decision later got\n\nl9 overruled by the Supreme Court, but at the time of Tykarsky, it\n2o clearly wasn't a Sixth Amendment Apprendi issue. They resolved\n2l that issue on an ex post facto basis. This decision about\n22 whether or not the offense conduct ended at a certain time, if\n23 it triggers an increase that implicates the ex post facto\n24 clause is a decision for the jury to make.

EVERDELL: No, your Honor. We rest on the papers.\n2 THE COURT: I thank you counsel for your thorough\n\n3 briefing. I am prepared to rule.\n\n4 The defendant raises four objections to the\n\n5 calculation of the guideline range contained in the PSR. As we\n6 discussed, first, she argues I must apply the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>\n\n7 rather than the 2oo4 <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>. Beyond that, she objects to\n\n8 the application of three sentencing enhancements.

So I will address the defense objections\nl2 and then the government's objections.\n\nl3 I begin by determining which of the Guideline manuals\nl4 apply. Generally, a sentencing court applies the version of\n\nl5 the <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> in effect on the date that the defendant is\n\nl6 sentenced. l8 U.S.C. Section 3553(a) (4) (A) (i). But the\n\nl7 Ex Post Facto Clause is violated if a defendant is sentenced\n\nl8 under <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> issued after she's commited her offense and\nl9 the new <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> provide a higher sentencing range than the\n2o version in place at the time of the offense. That's the\nal principle of a case called Peugh v. United States, 569 U.S. 53o\n22 (2ol3). In that case, a sentencing court must -- in the case\n23 of a higher range at the time of sentencing than in place at\n24 the time of the offense, in that case the sentencing court must\n25 apply the <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> in effect when the offense was commited.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.«*\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4783", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014784.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 779 Filed o8/22/22 Page 37 oflol 37\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl United States v. Guerrero, 9lo F.3d 72 (2d Cir. 2ol8). Here,\n\n2 the parties and the probation department agree that applying\n\n3 the current <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> would result in a significantly longer\n\n4 sentence than the application of the <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> in place when\n\niy the defendant commited her offense, whether that is the 2oo3\n\n6 or 2oo4 <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>.\n\n7 The controlling date for ex post facto purposes is the\n8 last date of the offense of conviction. The 2oo4 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>\n\n9 became effective on November l, 2oo4. So I must determine if\nlo the last date of the offense was after November l, 2oo4.\n\nll Because it seeks an increased punishment, the\n\nl2 government bears the burden of persuasion. The government\n\nl3 charged a decade-long conspiracy of sexual abuse that the\n\nl4 indictment alleged ended in 2oo4. It's proof at trial that the\nl5 conspiracy continued in 2oo4 related to Carolyn. And the\n\nl6 charged conspiracy had to end no later than very early 2oo5\n\nl7 because that's when Carolyn turned l8 and can no longer be\n\nl8 deemed a victim of the federal sex-trafficking offense charged\nl9 which proscribes conduct with respect to individuals under the\n2o age of l8. So the government purports to carry its burden on\n2l this issue based on portions of Carolyn's testimony and some\n22 message pads regarding what occurred in 2oo4 and 2oo5.\n23 Let me state clearly, I found, as I said repeatedly in\n24 my factual conclusions on the PSR objections, I found Carolyn\n25 to be a credible witness, as did the jury.

The\n6 first message GX-4B, it's undated, and the context does not\n\n7 give sufficient confidence that it came after November l. The\n8 other message pad is dated March l, 2oo5, which falls outside\n\n9 the scope of the conspiracy alleged in the indictment, and\n\nlo after Carolyn turned l8.

In defining the enhancement, the\n\n3 Commission instructs courts to closely consider the facts of\n\n4 the case to determine whether a participant's influence over\n\n5 the minor compromised the voluntariness of the minor's\n\n6 behavior. 2Gl.l, comment note 7. And if the participant is at\n7 least ten years older than the minor, there is a rebutable\n\n8 presumption that the participant unduly influenced the minor to\n9 engage in a commercial sex act. I overrule the defendant's\n\nlo objection.\n\nll The defendant first says the undue influence\n\nl2 enhancement would punish her for the same harm already counted\nl3 in her base offense level. Impermissible double counting\n\nl4 occurs when a guideline enhancement is applied to reflect the\nl5 kind of harm that's already fully accounted for elsewhere in\n\nl6 the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> but does not occur if the enhancement aims at\n\nl7 differing harms emanating from the same conduct or reflects\n\nl8 different facets of the defendant's conduct.

The 2Gl.l(a) base offense level reflects the\nal aggregating factor that the victim of the defendant's sex\n22 offense was a minor. The enhancement, by contrast, reflects\n23 the use of undue influence to engage in a commercial sex act.\n24 I'll cite a few cases that stand for that proposition,\n25 including United States v.

But the jury in\n\n9 Count Six did convict the defendant of sex trafficking Carolyn\nlo to participate in commercial sex acts. The Court finds that\n\nll Virginia Roberts, who brought Carolyn and Melissa who was\n\nl2 brought by Carolyn similarly were paid. The remaining victims,\nl3 including Jane and Annie, also testified that they received\n\nl4 money and gifts during their abuse which satisfies the\n\nl5 enhancement.\n\nl6 The defendant argues Carolyn was not unduly influenced\nl7 to sexually massage Epstein. I find this argument meritless.\nl8 The age gap between Carolyn and Epstein and the defendant far\nl9 exceeded ten years, and the defendant does not rebut the\n2o resulting presumption of undue influence. 2Gl.l, comment note\n2l 7.

EVERDELL: No, your Honor. We rest on the papers.\n2 THE COURT: I thank you counsel for your thorough\n3 briefing. I am prepared to rule.\n4 The defendant raises four objections to the\ni) calculation of the guideline range contained in the PSR. As we\n6 discussed, first, she argues I must apply the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>\n7 rather than the 2oo4 <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>. Beyond that, she objects to\n8 the application of three sentencing enhancements. The\n9 government's sole objection to the calculation of the\nlo <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> is that Virginia Roberts and Melissa should be\nll considered victims. So I will address the defense objections\nl2 and then the government's objections.\nl3 I begin by determining which of the Guideline manuals\nl4 apply. Generally, a sentencing court applies the version of\nl5 the <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> in effect on the date that the defendant is\nl6 sentenced. l8 U.S.C. Section 3553(a) (4) (A) (i). But the\nl7 Ex Post Facto Clause is violated if a defendant is sentenced\nl8 under <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> issued after she's commited her offense and\nl9 the new <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> provide a higher sentencing range than the\n2o version in place at the time of the offense. That's the\n2l principle of a case called Peugh v. United States, 569 U.S. 53o\n22 (2ol3). In that case, a sentencing court must -- in the case\n23 of a higher range at the time of sentencing than in place at\n24 the time of the offense, in that case the sentencing court must\n25 apply the <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> in effect when the offense was commited.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.ee8\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo37", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021038.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Page2l2 of 22l\n37\nMeSsQmaxl\nl United States v. Guerrero, 9lo F.3d 72 (2d Cir. 2ol8). Here,\n2 the parties and the probation department agree that applying\n3 the current <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> would result in a significantly longer\n4 sentence than the application of the <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> in place when\n5 the defendant commited her offense, whether that is the 2oo3\n6 or 2oo4 <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>.\n7 The controlling date for ex post facto purposes is the\n8 last date of the offense of conviction. The 2oo4 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>\n9 became effective on November l, 2oo4. So I must determine if\nlo the last date of the offense was after November l, 2oo4.\nll Because it seeks an increased punishment, the\nl2 government bears the burden of persuasion. The government\nl3 charged a decade-long conspiracy of sexual abuse that the\nl4 indictment alleged ended in 2oo4. It's proof at trial that the\nl5 conspiracy continued in 2oo4 related to Carolyn. And the\nl6 charged conspiracy had to end no later than very early 2oo5\nl7 because that's when Carolyn turned l8 and can no longer be\nl8 deemed a victim of the federal sex-trafficking offense charged\nl9 which proscribes conduct with respect to individuals under the\n2o age of l8. So the government purports to carry its burden on\n2l this issue based on portions of Carolyn's testimony and some\n22 message pads regarding what occurred in 2oo4 and 2oo5.\n23 Let me state clearly, I found, as I said repeatedly in\n24 my factual conclusions on the PSR objections, I found Carolyn\n25 to be a credible witness, as did the jury.

The\n6 first message GX-4B, it's undated, and the context does not\n7 give sufficient confidence that it came after November l. The\n8 other message pad is dated March l, 2oo5, which falls outside\n9 the scope of the conspiracy alleged in the indictment, and\nlo after Carolyn turned l8. Because I cannot on this record find\nll by a preponderance of the evidence that the offense continued\nl2 during that two-month windou after November l, 2oo4, and before\nl3 early 2oo5, I must apply the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>.

Rather, she argues that I may apply this\n\n8 enhancement only if I further find that the defendant poses a\n\n9 continuing danger to the public. Here, the defense draws this\nlo requirement from background commentary by the Sentencing\n\nll Commission and a few statements made by members of the Congress\nl2 who of emphasized high recidivism rates in enhancing sentences\nl3 for sex offenders.\n\nl4 I overrule this objection because it lacks any basis\nl5 in the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>.

If the text is unambiguous, I\nl7 apply it as writen and do not resort to background commentary.\nl8 United States v. Sash, 396 F.3d 5l5 (2d Cir. 2oo5). Commentary\nl9 cited by the defendant simply provides policy rationale for a\n2o particular enhancement. It does not purport to interpret the\n2l <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> and so is not binding. Nor can scatered\n22 legislative history override the clear text of the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>,\n23 especially when that history amounts to only a few short floor\n24 statements which are \"among the least illuminating forms of\n25 legislative history.\" NLRB v.

Late July 2oo6: The State Indicts Epstein, and the USAO Moves\nForward with a Federal Investigation\n\nSeveral days after Villafafia spoke with Acosta and Sloman, on July l9, 2oo6, Assistant\nState Atorney Belohlavek presented the case to the state grand jury.”*> Krischer told OPR that\n“the whole thing” was put before the grand jury. According to a statement made at the time by the\nState Atorney’s Office spokesman, the grand jury was presented with a list of charges from highest\nto louest, without a recommendation by the prosecutor, and deliberated with the prosecutor out of\nthe room.”* The state grand jury returned an indictment charging Epstein with one count of felony\nsolicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7, a felony under state law because\nit alleged three or more instances of solicitation.”° The indictment did not identify the person or\npersons solicited and made no mention of the fact that Epstein had solicited minors.”° On July 23,\n2oo6, Epstein self-surrendered to be arrested on the indictment, but was not detained, and the\ncharges were made public.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she decided to move forward with the federal investigation at that\npoint because she believed the State Atorney’s Office would permit Epstein to enter a plea to a\nreduced misdemeanor charge and that once he entered a guilty plea, the Department’s Petite policy\nmight preclude a federal prosecution.”’ Villafafia told OPR that at the time, she “definitely\nbelieved that we were going to proceed to [a federal] indictment, assuming that ...we had\nsufficient evidence.”\n23 Villafafia and the FBI obtained and examined records of the state grand jury proceeding, and Lourie reviewed\nthem. Because the grand jury records have not been ordered released publicly, OPR does not discuss their substance\nin this Report.\n24 Larry Keller, “Police say lawyer tried to discredit teenage girls,” Palm Beach Post, July 29, 2oo6, citing\nstatement by State Atorney’s Office spokesman Michael Edmondson.\n2 Indictment in State v. Epstein, 2oo6CF9454A XX (July l9, 2oo6), atached as Exhibit l to this Report.\n26 In pertinent part, the state indictment read, “[B]etween the Ist day of August [2oo4] and October 3l, 2oo5,\n[Epstein] did solicit, induce, entice, or procure another to commit prostitution lewdness, or assignation, . . . on three\nor more occasions.” The l5-month time frame and lack of detail regarding the place or manner of the offense made\nit impossible to identify from the charging document which victim or victims served as the basis for the charge in the\nstate indictment. Belohlavek explained to OPR that the charge did not list specific victims so that she could go forward\nat trial with whichever victim or victims might be available and willing to testify at that time.\na The Petite policy is a set of <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> used by federal prosecutors when considering whether to pursue federal\ncharges for defendants previously prosecuted for state or local offenses. The Constitution does not prohibit the federal\ngovernment from prosecuting defendants who have been charged, acquited, or convicted on state charges based on\nthe same criminal conduct. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing principle that the prohibition\nagainst double jeopardy does not apply to prosecutions brought by different sovereigns. See, e.g., Gamble v. United\nStates, 587 U.S. __, l39 S. Ct. l96o, l966-67 (2ol9) (and cases cited therein); Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S.\nl87, l95 (l959) (and cases cited therein); and United States v. Lanza, 26o U.S. 377, 382 (l922). Nonetheless, to\nbeter promote the efficient use of criminal justice resources, the Department developed policies in l959 and l96o to\nguide federal prosecutors in the use of their charging discretion. See Chapter Two, Part Two, Section II.A.2, for a\nmore detailed discussion of the Petite policy.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l22o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021222.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EAS 3536o38, Page5o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 48 of 348\nalso informed Sloman and Lourie that the FBI was re-interviewing victims who had given taped\nstatements to the PBPD, to ensure their stories “have not changed,” and that “[a]ny discrepancies\nwill be noted and considered.” She conceded that “[g]eting them to tell their stories in front of a\njury at trial may be much harder,” but expressed confidence that the two key victims “‘will stay the\ncourse.” She acknouledged that the case “needs to be rock solid.”\n\nThe case agent told OPR that in this initial stage of the investigation, the FBI “partnered\nup very well” with the USAO. She recalled that there was litle higher-level management oversight\neither from the FBI or the USAO, and “we were alloued to do what we needed to do to get our\njob done.” This included continuing to identify, locate, and interview victims and Epstein\nemployees, and obtaining records relating to Epstein’s travel, communications, and financial\ntransactions. The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”\n\n5. October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.** Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\nae Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\na Chapter One, Section II.B of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to . . . change anything.”\n\na4 Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nUS. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2l222", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021229.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ary eae 3536o38, Paged/ of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 55 of 348\n\nLourie folloued up his email to Villafafia with one to Menchel, in which Lourie reiterated\nthe potential benefits of a pre-indictment plea, explaining that he and Villafafia believed “the best\nthing to do is charge Epstein by complaint, assuming we decide to charge him. ... The\n[sentencing] <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> will be in the 2o year range, so we would need to plead him to one or two\nconspiracies to cap him and there is no telling if a judge would go for that once we indict.”*\nMenchel responded that he and Acosta would read the prosecution memorandum and “[w]e can\ndiscuss after that.”\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia sent Lourie an email, which Lourie forwarded to Menchel,\nexplaining that a “conservative calculation” of Epstein’s potential sentencing exposure under the\nU.S. Sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> would be l68 to 2lo months, and that in her view, the facts warranted\nan upward departure from that range. Villafafia told OPR that although Lourie proposed some\nchanges to the draft indictment, at that point no one had told her that the evidence was insufficient\nto support the proposed charges or that the office did not want to go forward with the case.\n\nIn an email to Acosta and Menchel on May ll, 2oo7, Lourie recommended charging\nEpstein by complaint and seeking a pre-indictment plea:\n\nMy current thoughts are that we should charge him. Not sure that I\nagree with the charging strategy as it is nou, but at this point I think\nwe only need to get on the same page as to whether the statutes cover\nthe conduct and whether the conduct is the type we should charge.\nI think the answer to both is yes, although there is some risk on some\nof the statutes as this is uncharted territory to some degree. We can\ndecide later what the [charging document] should look like precisely\nand which victims should be charged.\n\nI also think if we choose to go forward, we should start with a\ncomplaint, arrest him, detain him . . . and then try to see if he wants\na pre-indictment resolution. That would give us more control [over]\na plea than if we indict him and need the court’s approval to dismiss\ncounts. We will need to cap him with conspiracy counts to make a\nplea atractive and the court could give us a hard time with that if we\ntry to dismiss indicted counts.\n\nAlthough her supervisors were communicating among themselves about the case, Villafafia\nwas unaware of those discussions and was frustrated that she was not receiving more feedback.\nShe continued preparing to charge Epstein. Two weeks after submiting the prosecution\nmemorandum, on May l4, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Lourie and Menchel by email that Epstein\nwas flying to New Jersey from the Virgin Islands, and she asked whether she could file charges\nthe next day. Menchel responded that “[y]ou will not have approval to go forward tomorrou,”\nand explained that Acosta “has your [prosecution] memo,” but was at an out-of-toun conference,\nadding, “This is obviously a very significant case and [A]lex wants to take his time making sure\n43 Lourie told OPR that he was referring to one or two counts of conspiracy under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, the general\n“omnibus” federal conspiracy statute that carries a maximum sentence of five years.\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l229", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021239.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 6S 3536o38, Page67 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 65 of 348\nI do think it’s important to look back on this, and try to be in the\nshoes of the thought process in 2oo6 and ’o7 when trafficking\nprosecutions were fairly new, when... more so than today, some\njurors may have looked at this as prostitution, and .. . [a] judge’s\ntolerance for victim shaming may have . . . caused more hesitation\non the part of victims... .©\nFinally, Acosta told OPR that a state-based resolution offered more flexibility in fashioning\na sentence, because he believed prosecutors would have difficulty persuading a federal district\ncourt in the Southern District of Florida to approve a federal plea for a stipulated binding sentence\nthat differed from the otherwise applicable federal sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> range.“\nIn summarizing his thinking at the time, Acosta told OPR,\nThe way the mater came to the office was, the state wasn’t doing\nenough. It didn’t provide for prison time. It didn’t provide for\nregistration, and then you had the restitution issue. There were legal\nissues .... There were witness issues. And... we could go to trial\n...and we may or may not prevail. Alternatively, we could look at\na pre-indictment resolution, and at various points, the office went\nback and forth between a federal pre-indictment resolution, and a\nstate pre-indictment resolution.\nAcosta told OPR that, in the end, “there was a preference for deferring to the state” because, in\npart, the facts of the Epstein case at the time appeared to constitute solicitation or prostitution\nrather than trafficking, and a federal prosecution would be “uncharted territory.” Acosta explained\nthat he did not view it as problematic to defer resolution of the case to the state, although as the\nEpstein case played out, the federal role became “more intrusive” than he had anticipated, because\nthe defense tried to get the state to “circumvent and undermine” the outcome.\nAtorney’s Office could have proceeded against Epstein by way of an information, but decided to go into the grand\njury because the State Atorney’s Office “didn’t like the case” and wanted “political cover” for declining the case or\nproceeding on a lesser charge.\n83 Menchel told OPR, houever, that the federal judges in West Palm Beach were highly regarded and were\ngenerally viewed as “pro-prosecution.”\n64 Acosta said that “dismissing a number of counts and then doing a [R]ule ll is not something that [South\nFlorida federal district] judges tend to do.” Other subjects also told OPR that the federal judges in the Southern District\nof Florida were generally considered averse to pleas that bound them on sentencing, commonly referred to as “Rule\nll(c) pleas.”\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) allous the parties to agree on a specific sentence as part of\na plea agreement. The court is required to impose that sentence if the court accepts the plea agreement; if the court\ndoes not accept the agreed upon plea and sentence, the agreement is void. Villafafia told OPR that Rule ll(c) pleas\nwere “uncommon” in the Southern District of Florida, as the “judges do not like to be told . . . what sentence to\nimpose.” Menchel similarly told OPR that the USAO viewed federal judges in the Southern District of Florida as\naverse to Rule ll(c) pleas, although Menchel had negotiated such pleas. Villafafia told OPR that she had never offered\na Rule ll(c) plea in any of her cases and had no experience with such pleas.\n39\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l239", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021240.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N66 3536o38, Page68 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 66 of 348\nMenchel could not recall who initially suggested a state plea, but noted to OPR that his\noun “emails... make clear that this course of action was ultimately decided by Alex Acosta.” He\nreferenced, among others, his May l4, 2oo7 email to Villafafia informing her that Acosta was\ndeciding hou he wanted to handle the case. Menchel surmised that a state resolution accomplished\ntwo things that Acosta viewed as important: first, it resolved any Petite policy concerns, and\nsecond, it afforded more flexibility in sentencing than a federal plea would have alloued. Menchel\ntold OPR that the state plea proposal did not reflect any minimization of Epstein’s conduct and\nthat any state plea would have been to an offense that required sexual offender registration. He\ntold OPR, “I don’t think anybody sat around and said, you knou, it’s not that big a deal. That was\nnot the reaction that I think anybody had from the federal side of this case.” Rather, Menchel said,\n“The concern was if we charge him [as proposed], there’s going to be a trial.”\n2. July 2oo7: Villafaia and Menchel Disagree about the Proposed State\nResolution\nVillafafia told OPR that she was angry when she received Menchel’s July email explaining\nthat he had proposed to Sanchez resolving the federal investigation through a state plea. In\nVillafafia’s view, the proposed state resolution “didn’t make any sense” and “did not correspond”\nto Department policy requiring that a plea offer reflect “the most serious readily provable\noffense.”® In her view, a plea to a state charge “obviously” would not satisfy this policy. Villafafia\nalso told OPR that in her view, the USAM required the USAO to confer with the investigative\nagency about plea negotiations, and Villafafia did not believe the FBI would be in favor of a state\nplea. Villafafia also believed the CVRA required atorneys for the government to confer with\nvictims before making a plea offer, but the victims had not been consulted about this proposal.\nVillafafia told OPR she had met with some of the victims during the course of the investigation\nwho had negative impressions of the State Atorney’s Office, and she believed that “sending them\nback to the State Atorney’s Office was not something” those victims would support.\nbe This policy was set forth in a September 22, 2oo3 memorandum from then Atorney General John Ashcroft\nregarding “Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and Sentencing”\n(knoun as the “Ashcroft Memo”), which provided, in pertinent part:\n[I]n all federal criminal cases, federal prosecutors must charge and pursue the\nmost serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts\nof the case, except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, United States\nAtorney, or designated supervisory atorney in the limited circumstances\ndescribed belou. The most serious offense or offenses are those that generate the\nmost substantial sentence under the Sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, unless a mandatory\nminimum sentence or count requiring a consecutive sentence would generate a\nlonger sentence. A charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor has a good\nfaith doubt, for legal or evidentiary reasons, as to the Government’s ability readily\nto prove a charge at trial. Thus, charges should not be filed simply to exert\nleverage to induce a plea. Once filed, the most serious readily provable charges\nmay not be dismissed except to the extent permited [elsewhere in this\nMemorandum].\nSee also Chapter Two, Part Two, Section I.B.l.\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l24o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021249.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye, ae 3536o38, Page/7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 75 of 348\nVillafafia, Menchel left the meeting after almost no discussion, leaving Villafafia “shocked and\nstunned.”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall the July 26, 2oo7 meeting. Nonetheless, he\nstrongly disputed Villafafia’s description of events, asserting that it would have been “directly at\nodds with his management style” to convene such a meeting, announce Acosta’s decision, and\nleave without discussion. Acosta told OPR that he had “decided and endorsed this resolution at\nsome point,” but he did not recall being aware that Menchel was going to announce the decision\nat the July 26 meeting; in addition, although Acosta did not recall the circumstances of Menchel’s\nrelaying of that decision, he said it “would have been consistent with” his decision for Menchel to\ndo so. Neither Sloman nor Lourie recalled the meeting. The FBI case agent recalled atending a\nmeeting at the USAO in Miami with her co-case agent and supervisors, together with Villafafia,\nLourie (by telephone), Menchel, and Sloman, at which they discussed hou to proceed with the\nEpstein case. According to the case agent, at this meeting the FBI insisted that Epstein be\nregistered for life as a sexual offender, and the co-case agent advocated for waiting until the court\nhad ruled on the USAO’s ability to obtain Epstein’s computer equipment.\n\nRegardless of exactly hou Acosta’s decision regarding the two-year term was\ncommunicated to Villafafia and the FBI agents, and regardless of who initially proposed the\nspecific term, the record shous that Acosta ultimately made the decision to offer Epstein a\nresolution that included a two-year term of imprisonment, as he acknouledged. ”\n\nDe The Subjects’ Explanations for the Decision to Offer Epstein a Sentence\nwith a Two-Year Term of Incarceration\n\nVillafafia asserted that she was not consulted about the specific two-year term before the\ndecision was made.”” Villafafia told OPR that she had worked hard to develop a strong case, and\nnone of her supervisors had identified to her any specific problem with the case that, in her view,\nexplained the decision to extend an offer for a two-year sentence. Villafafia also told OPR that\nMenchel provided no explanation for this decision during the July 26, 2oo7 meeting, and Villafafia\ndid not ask for an explanation because she accepted his statement that it was Acosta’s decision.\nVillafafia described the proposal as “random,” and told OPR, “[W]e’re all [sentencing] <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>\npeople, so 24 months just makes no sense in the context of the <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>. There’s no way to get\nto 24 months with this set of offenses.”°°\n78 OPR notes that Villafafia did not appear hesitant to send emails to her supervisors seting forth her views and\nobjections, and there is no reference before this meeting in any of her emails indicating that a decision had been made\nto offer a two-year term of incarceration. Therefore, given that a meeting had been arranged involving Menchel and\nVillatfafia, and possibly most of the other primary USAO and FBI participants, it seems logical that Acosta made a\ndecision to resolve the case with a two-year state plea not long before the meeting.\n\na OPR found no evidence in the documentary record indicating that Villafafia had knouledge of Acosta’s\ndecision or the two-year term before the July 26, 2oo7 meeting at which she said she learned of it.\n4a From the time the U.S. Sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> went into effect in l987, they have been the mechanism for\ncalculating federal criminal sentences. Since 2oo5, the <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> have been non-binding, but the federal courts are\nrequired to consider them.

He opined to OPR that the decision was likely based on an\nassessment by Menchel and Lourie of the litigation risks presented by the case.*! Sloman added\nthat he did not knou hou a two-year sentence might have related to specific charges or to either\nstate or federal sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>. Lourie likewise told OPR he did not recall hou the two-year\nterm was decided upon, or by whom, but he speculated that it may have been presented by the\ndefense as the most Epstein would accept, and that the decision would have been reached by\nAcosta follouing “extended consideration, research, and discussion,” among Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. **\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall discussing a two-year plea deal with Acosta or\nwho reached the decision that two years was an appropriate sentence. Menchel also told OPR,\nhouever, that he recalled believing that if the USAO had filed the contemplated federal charges,\nEpstein would have felt he had “nothing to lose” and “undoubtedly” would have chosen to take\nthe case to trial. Menchel recalled believing there was a real risk that the USAO might lose at trial,\nand in so doing, might cause more trauma to the victims, particularly those who were reluctant to\ntestify. Menchel told OPR that he did not believe that anyone at the time looked at two years “as\na fair result in terms of the conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not\nif we took this case to trial, would we risk losing everything,” and “if we. . . felt we could have\ngoten more time, we would have, without having to press it to the trial.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “I had decided and endorsed” the two-year resolution “at some\npoint,” and that it resulted from “back and forth” discussion “over the course of some days or a\nweek or two.” As noted earlier in this Report, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in this case merely\nas a “backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he explained to OPR was “a polite way of saying[,\n‘Jencouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]”®’ Acosta said that he understood two years’\nimprisonment to have represented the sentence Epstein faced under one of the original charges the\nPBPD was considering at the outset of the state investigation.** Acosta also told OPR that he\n\nthe atorney for the government has a continuing obligation to assist the court in\n\nits determination of the sentence to be imposed. The prosecutor must be familiar\n\nwith the <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> generally and with the specific guideline provisions applicable\n\nto his or her case. In discharging these duties, the atorney for the government\n\nshould . . . endeavor to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information\n\nupon which the sentencing decisions will be based.\n8l In Sloman’s view, Menchel and Lourie were “two of the finest trial lawyers” in the USAO.\n82 Lourie noted that Sloman and Menchel were “two extraordinarily experienced people in [Acosta’s] front\noffice who had tried . . . gobs and gobs of cases.”\nBS In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney asserted that OPR’s use of Acosta’s quote, “a litle\nbit more,” “unfairly minimized” Acosta’s and the USAO’s efforts to achieve justice in this case. Acosta’s atorney\nalso asserted that the phrase was “clearly soft-spoken understatement,” that the terms obtained were “substantially\nmore onerous than the state’s alternative resolution,” and that Acosta was “clearly declining the invitation to take the\nState to task and soft-pedaling an obvious distinction.”\n\nSA OPR examined this assertion and was unable to verify that the proposed two-year term of imprisonment\ncorresponded with the charges that the PBPD considered at the outset of the state investigation or with the charge in\n5o\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l25o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021251.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OT 3536o38, Page/9 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 77 of 348\nunderstood that the PBPD would not have asked the FBI to investigate Epstein if the state had\npursued the appropriate charges. In other words, in Acosta’s view, “[T]his was, rightly or wrongly,\nan analysis that distinguished between what is necessary to prevent manifest injustice, versus what\nis the appropriate federal outcome to that.” Acosta told OPR that he believed he had discussed his\nconcerns about the case with Lourie, Sloman, or Menchel, although he could not recall any specific\nconversation with them.\n\nE, Villafafia Drafts a “Term Sheet” Listing the Requirements of a Potential\n\nAgreement with the Defense\n\nA meeting with defense counsel was scheduled for Tuesday, July 3l, 2oo7. Villafafia told\nOPR that between July 26 and July 3o, 2oo7, she had “some sort of discussion” with her\nsupervisors that resulted in her creation of a “term sheet” identifying the proposed terms for\nresolving the federal investigation through state charges. Sometime during that period, Villafafia\nleft a voicemail message for Menchel. During their OPR interviews, neither Villafafia nor\nMenchel could recall what Villafafia said in that message. On July 3o, 2oo7, Menchel emailed\nVillafafia:\n\nI received your voicemail this morning. I don’t see any reason to\nchange our approach. I think telling them that unless the state\nresolves this in a way that appropriately vindicates our interests and\nthe interests of the victims, we will seek [federal charges] conveys\nthat we are serious. While Lilly [Sanchez] has represented in the\npast that this would likely not happen, I never conveyed it in quite\nthese terms before. In any event, this is the course of action that the\nUS Atomey feels comfortable taking at this juncture.\n\nThe follouing day, July 3l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed a one-page “Terms of Epstein\nNon-Prosecution Agreement” to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie. Villafafia told OPR she had never\nbefore seen or heard of a non-prosecution agreement and that it was a concept “completely foreign”\nto her.*° Villafafia told OPR that the idea of styling the two-year state plea agreement with Epstein\nthe state indictment. OPR considered various potential state charges involving various numbers of victims and found\nno obvious reasonable state sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> calculation that would have resulted in a two-year sentence.\n\n88 Deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements were standard, though infrequently used, vehicles for\nresolving certain federal criminal cases against corporate entities. A 2oo8 Departmental memorandum explained:\n\nThe terms “deferred prosecution agreement” and “non-prosecution agreement”\n\nhave often been used loosely by prosecutors, defense counsel, courts and\n\ncommentators. As the terms are used in these Principles [of Federal Prosecution\n\nof Business Organizations], a deferred prosecution agreement is typically\n\npredicated upon the filing of a formal charging document by the government, and\n\nthe agreement is filed with the appropriate court. In the non-prosecution\n\nagreement context, formal charges are not filed and the agreement is maintained\n\nby the parties rather than being filed with a court. Clear and consistent use of\n\nthese terms will enable the Department to more effectively identify and share best\n\npractices and to track the use of such agreements. These Principles do not apply\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l25l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021254.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N8o 3536o38, Page82 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8o of 348\nthe period of imprisonment, because the USAO failed to hold firm to its proposal of “at least two\nyears in prison.” The USAO did, houever, consistently reject defense proposals to change other\nterms, particularly the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.\nA.

Villafafia told OPR\nthat when Epstein’s atorneys expressed concern during the meeting about Epstein’s security in a\nstate prison and argued for a home confinement sentence, Menchel suggested Epstein plead to a\nfederal charge so that he could serve his time in a federal facility. A few days after the meeting,\nVillafafia emailed Menchel, stating that she had “figured out a way to do a federal plea with a 2-l/2\nyear cap.”\n\nAlthough Acosta had authorized a plea to state charges, emails and other correspondence\nshou that during the negotiations, the parties also considered structuring a plea around federal\n87 Villafafia was the only witness with whom OPR spoke who had a substantive memory of this meeting.\n\n88 According to the Florida Department of Corrections fact sheet for defendants subjected to community control,\n\nThe Community Control supervision program was created as a diversion to\n\nincarceration or imprisonment; therefore it is an intensive supervision program\n\nwhere you are confined to your home unless you are working, atending school,\n\nperforming public service hours, participating in treatment or another special\n\nactivity that has been approved in advance by your officer. The program was\n\ndesigned to build accountability and responsibility along with providing a\n\npunishment alternative to imprisonment.

We did not.” Villafafia anticipated there would be ways to “manipulate” a state\nsentence and the USAO would be “giving up all control,” and she told OPR that she discussed this concern with\nLourie, although she could not recall when that discussion occurred.\n\n54\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l254", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021265.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document NOL 3536o38, Page93 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 9l of 348\n\nVillafafia told OPR that during the meeting, the group discussed the draft NPA, but she did\nnot think they gave a copy to Krischer and Belohlavek. Neither Krischer nor Belohlavek expressed\nconcern about proceeding as the USAO was proposing. According to Villafafia, Belohlavek\nexplained that a plea to the three state counts identified in the draft NPA would affect the state’s\nsentencing <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>, and that it would be beter for the <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> calculation if Epstein pled\nguilty to just one of the three counts. Villafafia recalled that when Belohlavek confirmed that\nEpstein would be required to register as a sexual offender if he pled to any one of the three charges,\nLourie, speaking for the USAO, agreed to allou Epstein to enter his plea to just one state charge\nin addition to the pending state indictment, and the defense atorneys selected the charge of\nprocurement of minors to engage in prostitution.!°° Lourie, houever, disputed Villafafia’s\nrecollection that he made the final decision, stating that it was “illogical” to conclude that he had\nthe authority to change the terms of agreement unilaterally. ©’\n\nDuring the meeting, defense counsel raised concerns about Epstein serving time in state\nprison. Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie, the other supervisor, and she made clear during the\nmeeting that they expected Epstein to be incarcerated 24 hours a day, seven days a week, during\nthe entirety of his sentence, and they did not “particularly care” whether it was in a state or local\nfacility. Belohlavek explained to OPR that in order for Epstein to serve his time in a county\nfacility, rather than state prison, his sentence on each charge could be no more than l2 months, so\nthat, for example, consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months—totaling l8 months—could be\nserved in the county jail. Villafafia told OPR:\n\nOur thing was incarceration 24 hours a day. So during this meeting,\n\nI remember [the defense] talking about... a one year count folloued\n\nby a six-month count . .. that [Epstein] could serve them back to\n\nback but at the county jail, rather than having to go to a state facility.\n\nBut then I said, “But if you do that, it’s still going to have to be round\n\nthe clock incarceration.” And Barry Krischer said yes. And [he]\n\nsaid that to avoid [Epstein being extorted while incarcerated], he\n\nwould be kept in solitary confinement.\nVillafafia did not recall whether she and Lourie agreed to an l8-month sentence during that\nmeeting, but she told OPR that in her view, allouing Epstein to serve his sentence in the county\njail was not a “concession” because he would be incarcerated regardless.\n\nNeither Lourie nor the other USAO supervisor present could recall any substantive details\nof the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and Krischer and Belohlavek told OPR they did not remember\nthe meeting at all. Krischer did, houever, recall that he was “not offended at all” when he learned\nof the proposed federal resolution, requiring Epstein to plead to both the pending state indictment\nand an additional charge requiring sexual offender registration, explaining to OPR that Epstein\n“was going to plead guilty to my indictment, we were going to add an additional charge, he was\nlo6 Later, the defense would claim that they had mistakenly understood that the selected charge would not\ninvolve sexual offender registration.\n\nlo7 As noted belou, a contemporaneous email indicates that shortly after the meeting, Lourie and Villafafia spoke\nwith Acosta and Sloman, who concurred with the agreement.\n65\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l265", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021272.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, SA_o8 3536o38, Pageloo of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 98 of 348\nwe go that route, would you intend to make the deferred [sic] prosecution agreement public?”\nVillafafia replied that while a federal plea agreement would be part of the court file and publicly\naccessible, the NPA “would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would remain part\nof our case file. It probably would be subject to a FOIA [Freedom of Information Act] request,\nbut it is not something that we would distribute without compulsory process.”!!° Villafafia told\nOPR that she believed Epstein did not want the NPA to be made public because he “did not want\npeople to believe him to have commited a variety of crimes.” As she explained to OPR, Villafafia\nbelieved the NPA did not need to be disclosed in its entirety, but she anticipated notifying the\nvictims about the NPA provisions relating to their ability to recover damages.\nE. The Parties Appear to Reach Agreement on a Plea to Federal Charges\nNegotiations continued the next day, Tuesday, September l8, 2oo7. Responding to\nVillafafia’s revised draft of the NPA, Lefkouitz suggested that Epstein plead to one federal charge\nwith a l2-month sentence, folloued by one year of supervised release with a requirement for home\ndetention and two years of state probation, with the first six months of the state sentence to be\nserved under community control. Villafafia replied, “I knou that the U.S. Atorney will not go\nbelou l8 months of prison/jail time (and I would strongly oppose the suggestion).” Shortly\nthereafter, Villafafia emailed Acosta, Lourie, and the incoming West Palm Beach manager:\nHi all — I think that we may be near the end of our negotiations with\nMr. Epstein, and not because we have reached a resolution. As I\nmentioned yesterday, I spent about l2 hours over the weekend\ndrafting Informations, changing plea agreements, and writing\nfactual proffers. I was supposed to receive a draft agreement from\nthem yesterday, which never arrived. At that time, they were\nleaning touards pleading only to state charges and doing all of the\ntime in state custody.\nLate last night I talked to Jay Lefkouitz who asked about Epstein\npleading to two twelve-month federal charges with half of his jail\ntime being spent in home confinement pursuant to the <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>.

When [Epstein] gets out, he has to plead to state\noffenses, including against minor, registrable, and then take one year house arrest/community\nconfinement.” By reply email, Villafafia asked Lourie to call her, but there is no record of whether\nthey spoke.\n\nF. Defense Counsel Offers New Proposals Substantially Changing the Terms of\n\nthe Federal Plea Agreement, which the USAO Rejects\n\nApproximately an hour after Lourie’s email reporting the deal he had reached with\nLefkouitz, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a revised draft plea agreement. Despite the agreement Lourie\nbelieved he and Lefkouitz had reached that morning, Lefkouitz’s proposal would have resulted\nin a l6-month federal sentence folloued by 8 months of supervised release served in the form of\nhome detention. Lefkouitz also inserted a statement in his proposal explicitly prohibiting the\nUSAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration authorities to institute immigration\nproceedings against two of Epstein’s female assistants.\n\nVillafafia circulated the defense’s proposed plea agreement to Lourie and two other\nsupervisors, and expressed frustration that the new defense version incorporated terms that were\n“completely different from what Jay just told Andy they would agree to.” Villafafia also pointed\nout that the defense “wants us to recommend an improper calculation” of the sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>\nll8 The manager told OPR that he probably meant this as a joke because in his view the continued back-and-\nforth communications with defense counsel “was ridiculous,” and the only way to “get this deal done” might be to\nhave a direct conversation with Epstein.\n\n73\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l273", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021322.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l48 3536o38, Pagel5o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l48 of 348\nSome offenses, even though in violation of Federal law, are of\nparticularly strong interest to the authorities of the state or local\njurisdiction in which they occur, either because of the nature of the\noffense, the identity of the offender or victim, the fact that the\ninvestigation was conducted primarily by state or local\ninvestigators, or some other circumstance.

When\nopting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision\nare communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files. USAM § 9-27.27o.\n\n2. USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°? The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist.

The Ashcroft Memo cautioned.\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.

U.S. Atorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.7°\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. IL,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.”).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction.

See USAM §§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.”°’ Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “‘a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o7 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\nCircumstances,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional circumstances with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an Assistant Atorney General, United States Atorney, or designated\n\nsupervisory atorney. This exception recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system. For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office. Houever, such case-by-case\n\nexceptions should be rare; otherwise the goals of fairness and equity will be\n\njeopardized.\nAshcroft Memo at § I.B.6.

In\nAcosta’s view, “the federal responsibility” in this unique situation was merely to serve as a “back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”*’ Acosta told OPR\nthat he understood the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s atention if the State\nAtorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration. Acosta therefore decided that\nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein\nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.\n\nAcosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated references to a\n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used\nin the Petite policy to define the circumstances in which the federal government may proceed with\na criminal case after a completed state prosecution. Nothing in the Petite policy, houever, requires\nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a completed state\nprosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense. The goal of the Petite\npolicy is to prevent multiple prosecutions for the same offense, not to compel the federal\ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials\ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions\nregarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case. Acosta told OPR that “there are any\nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state\ncharges are substantially less and different, and . . . the federal government . . . stands aside and\nlets the state proceed.” The fact that the federal government can allou the state to proceed with a\nprosecution, houever, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in\na mater in which a distinct and important federal interest exists. Indeed, the State Atorney told\nOPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators,\ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”\n\nEpstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>.”**\nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily\nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a litle bit more” does not approach\nthat standard. In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent\nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,”\nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from\nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to\noth Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\nams Villafafia estimated that the applicable sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> range was l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment.\n\nl72\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l372", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021380.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 3o6 3536o38, Page2o8 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o6 of 348\n“[’m reconstructing memories of... l2 years ago. I can speculate that at some point, the mater\ncame up, and I or someone else said... what would the original charges have likely brought? And\nsomeone said this amount.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall who initially proposed this\nmethod, but he believed that it likely did not result from a single specific discussion but rather\nfrom conversations over a course of time. Acosta could not recall specifically with whom he had\nthese discussions, other than that it would have been Lourie, Menchel, or Sloman. Villafafia was\nnot asked for her views on a two-year sentence, and she had no input into the decision before it\nwas made. Villafafia told OPR that she examined the state statutes and could not validate that a\nstate charge would have resulted in a 24-month sentence. OPR also examined applicable state\nstatutes and the Florida sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>, but could not confirm that Epstein was, in fact,\nfacing a potential two-year sentence under charges contemplated by the PBPD.\n\nOn the other hand, during his OPR interview, Lourie “guess[ed]” that “somehou the\ndefense conveyed .. . we’re going to trial if it’s more than two years.” Menchel similarly told\nOPR that he did not knou hou the two year sentence was derived, but “obviously it was a number\nthat the office felt was palatable enough that [Epstein] would take” it. Sloman told OPR that he\nhad no idea hou the two-year sentence proposal was reached.\n\nThe contemporaneous documentary record, houever, provides no indication that Epstein’s\nteam proposed a two-year sentence of incarceration or initially suggested, before the USAO made\nits offer, that Epstein would accept a two-year term of incarceration. As late as July 25, 2oo7—\nonly days before the USAO provided the term sheet to defense counsel—Epstein’s counsel\nsubmited a leter to the USAO arguing that the federal government should not prosecute Epstein\nat all. Furthermore, after the initial “term sheet” was presented and negotiations for the NPA\nprogressed, Epstein’s team continued to strongly press for less or no time in jail.\n\nThe USAO had other charging and sentencing options available to it. The most obvious\nalternative to the two-year sentence proposal was to offer Epstein a plea to a federal offense that\ncarried a harsher sentence. If federally charged, Epstein was facing a substantial sentence under\nthe federal sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>, l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment. Houever, it is unlikely that\nhe would have agreed to a plea that required a <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> sentence, even one at the louer end of\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues had been concerned that Epstein\nwould opt to go to trial if charged and presented with the option of pleading to a <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>\nsentence, and as previously discussed, there were both evidentiary and legal risks atendant upon\na trial in this case. If federally charged, Epstein’s sentencing exposure could have been managed.\nby offering him a plea under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c) for a stipulated sentence,\nwhich requires judicial approval. Acosta rejected this idea, houever, apparently because of a\nperception that the federal district courts in the Southern District of Florida did not view Rule ll(c)\npleas favorably and might refuse to accept such a plea and thus limit the USAO’s options.\n\nAnother alternative was to offer Epstein a plea to conspiracy, a federal charge that carried\na maximum five-year sentence. Shortly after Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum\nto her supervisors, Lourie recommended to Acosta charging Epstein by criminal complaint and\noffering a plea to conspiracy “to make a plea atractive.” Similarly, before learning that Menchel\nhad already discussed a state-based resolution with Epstein’s counsel, Villafafia had considered\noffering Epstein a plea to one count of conspiracy and a substantive charge, to be served\nconcurrently with any sentence he might receive separately as a result of the state’s outstanding\n\nl8o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l38o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021381.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 3o7 3536o38, Page2o9 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o7 of 348\nindictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution\nthat ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would\nbe sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\ntraditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis. In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l38l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021390.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l6 of 348\ne * rm: *\nTimeline of Key Events for Crime Victims’ Rights Act Analysis\nAug lo~- FBI Dec 7 — Sloman tells July 7 —Jane Doe files an Additional Key Dates O\nbegins interviewing Vv illafafia to “hold the emergency petition against oO\nvictims leter” re notification to the United States asserting Dec l7, 2olo — DOJ oO\ncna state court violations of the CVRA Office of Legal Ro\nAug 24 — Villafafia e-mail amici aman UM guccnes eli inion i\n8 28 : “es y : \" a secures pit-bone July 9 — USAO begins geoardi one x\n: ‘aes b a ee aoe Dec l9 — Acosta sends pound ac sending leters to victims No\n“i ‘fica a ar he a ill leter to Epstein’s counsel Sakine= Fay concerning resolution of Oct 2oll — DOJ revises om\nunease ean al Ei advising USAO will defer spaseg sat ee federal investigation AG <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>\nof the girls Matis Ceara interviews victims Oo\nnotification of state plea fe)\nto state officials May 29, 2ol5 —-CVRA OQ\n\\] Aug 28 — FBI begins a\" amended to include two 5\nge ed ee Jan lo FBI new rights D\nds VNS letw ; =|\nracial bait Feb 2l, 2ol9 — Dist.

For\nexample, the first right grants a victim protection from “the accused,” not a suspect.

The 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> were superseded in October 2oll, as explained\nbelou.\n\nl93\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l393", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021394.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 35o 3536o38, Page222 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22o of 348\ninformation about available services for victims. Therefore, even\nthough [the Department] may not afford CVRA rights to victims if\ncharges have not been filed in their cases, the [D]epartment may\nprovide certain services to victims that may serve the same function\n\nas some CVRA rights.””°\n\nThe 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> stated that the “prosecution stage” of the case began when “charges\nare filed and continue[d] through postsentencing legal proceedings.” The “U.S. Atorney in whose\ndistrict the prosecution is pending” was responsible for making “best efforts to see that crime\nvictims are notified” of their rights under the CVRA.\n\nDuring the prosecution stage, the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> required the U.S. Atorney, or a\ndesignee, to notify crime victims of case events, such as the filing of charges; the release of an\noffender; the schedule of court proceedings; the acceptance of a guilty plea or nolo contendere or\nrendering of a verdict; and any sentence imposed. The 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> required the responsible\nofficial to “provide the victim with reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding .. . that involves the crime against the victim.”\n\nThe 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult\nwith victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea\nnegotiations, and pretrial diversion. In particular, the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> required the responsible\nofficial to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views\nabout, prospective plea negotiations. Nevertheless, the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a conviction. Depending on the agency having custody of the defendant, the U.S.\nAtorney or other agencies were responsible for victim notifications during this stage.\n\nIV. USAO AND FBI VICTIM/WITNESS NOTIFICATION PRACTICE AT THE TIME\n\nOF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. USAO Training\n\nAs US. Atorney, Acosta disseminated the May 2oo5 updated <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> to USAO\npersonnel with a transmital memorandum dated February 27, 2oo6, stating that he expected each\nrecipient “to read and become familiar with the [2oo5] <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>.” Acosta noted in the\nmemorandum that the USAO had recently held an “all office training” addressing the 2oo5\n<span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> and that new USAO atorneys who missed the training were required to view a\nvideotaped version of the training “immediately.” Acosta further noted that the USAO’s\n2lo GAO CVRA Awareness Report at 66.\n\nl94\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l394", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021395.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 35l 3536o38, Page223 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22l of 348\nvictim/witness staff were “ready to assist you with the details of victim notification, and other\nareas for which United States Atorney[’]s Offices are nou explicitly responsible under the act.”\nThe USAO’s Victim Witness Program Coordinator told OPR that the USAO provided annual\nmandatory office-wide training on victim/witness issues and training for new employees.\n\nB. The Automated Victim Notification System\n\nBoth the FBI and the USAO manage contacts with crime victims through the Victim\nNotification System (VNS), an automated system maintained by the Executive Office for United\nStates Atorneys. The 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> mandated that “victim contact information and notice to\nvictims of events ... shall, absent exceptional circumstances (such as cases involving juvenile or\nforeign victims), be conducted and maintained using VNS.” The VNS is separate from agency\ncase management systems maintained by the FBI and the USAO. Both the FBI and the USAO\nuse the VNS to generate form leters to victims at various points in the investigation and the\nprosecution of a criminal case. Although each form leter can be augmented to add some limited\nindividual mater-specific content, the leters contain specific language concerning the purpose of\nthe contact that cannot be removed (such as the arrest of the defendant or the scheduling of a\nsentencing hearing).””!\n\nIn the usual course of a criminal case, the FBI collects victim contact information during\nthe investigation stage, which it stores in its case management system.

The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview. The pamphlet entitled “The\nDepartment of Justice Victim Notification System” provided an overview of the VNS and\ninstructions on hou to access the system.\n\nV. THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim Notification Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\nSpecialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\nNotification Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.?” Thereafter, the Victim Specialist\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”?”\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim Specialist\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\nas These 3o were drawn from the PBPD investigative file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\ndesignated as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed.\naH The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim Specialist] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights .. . and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim Specialist.”\n\nl96\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l396", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021398.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 354 3536o38, Page226 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 224 of 348\nIf you have additional questions which invalve this matier, please contact the office listed above.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim Specialist was preparing and sending FBI victim\nnotification leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t... have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\n<span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?7°\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\n275 OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l398", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021399.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 355 3536o38, Page227 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 225 of 348\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?”’\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.””> Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing of a criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially recetving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\n\n277 Villafafia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\nSpecialist who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\naes Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n2m Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [<span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\n\nl99\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l399", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021419.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 345 3536o38, Page247 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 245 of 348\nhave “notified [the victims] that that was an all-encompassing plea, that that state court sentence\nwould also mean that the federal government was not proceeding.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he thought Acosta and Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Sigal Mandelker had agreed that the decision whether to notify the victims of the state\ncourt proceedings should be “left to the state.”*\"3 Mandelker, houever, had no memory of advising\nAcosta to defer the decision to make notifications to the State Atorney, and she noted that the\n“correspondence [OPR] provided to me from that time period” discussing such a decision\n“demonstrates that all of the referenced language came from Mr. Acosta and/or his team, and that\nI did not provide, suggest, or edit the language.” Sloman told OPR that he initially believed that\n“the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially because they had restitution rights\nunder § 2255”; but, his expectations changed after “there was an agreement made that we were\ngoing to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to decide hou the victims were going\nto be notified.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek told OPR that she did not at any time receive a victim\nlist from the USAO. She further said she did not receive any request from the USAO with regard\nto contacting the victims.\n\nIn response to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter, Lefkouitz asserted that the FBI should\nnot communicate with the victims, and that the state, not the USAO, should determine who can be\nheard at the sentencing hearing:\n\n[Y]Jour leter also suggests that our objection to your Office’s\n\nproposed victims notification leter was that the women identified\n\nas victims of federal crimes should not be notified of the state\n\nproceedings. That is not true, as our previous leter clearly states.\n\nPuting aside our threshold contention that many of those to whom\n\n[CVRA] notification leters are intended are in fact not victims as\n\ndefined in the Atorney General’s 2ooo Victim Witness\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>—a status requiring physical, emotional or pecuniary\n\ninjury of the [victim]—it was and remains our position that these\n\nwomen may be notified of such proceedings but since they are\n\nneither witnesses nor victims to the state prosecution of this mater,\n\nthey should not be informed of fictitious “rights” or invited to make\n\nsworn writen or in-court testimonial statements against Mr. Epstein\n\nat such proceedings, as Ms. Villafafia repeatedly maintained they\n\nhad the right to do.

We\n\nagree, houever, with your December l9 modification of the\n\npreviously drafted federal notification leter and agree that the\n325 In his June 3, 2oo8 leter to Deputy Atorney General Mark Filip, Sloman wrote, “Acosta again consulted\nwith DAAG Mandelker who advised him to make the follouing proposal [to defer notification to the State Atorney’s\nOffice].” OPR found no other documentation relating to Mandelker’s purported involvement in the decision.\n\n2l9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4l9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021420.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 346 3536o38, Page248 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 246 of 348\ndecision as to who can be heard at a state sentencing is, amongst\nmany other issues, properly within the aegis of state decision\n\nmaking.*4\n\nFollouing a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, in which Acosta asked that the\ndefense clarify its positions on the USAO proposals regarding, among other things, notifications\nto the victims, Lefkouitz responded with a December 26, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, objecting again to\nnotification of the victims. Lefkouitz argued that CVRA notification was not appropriate because\nthe Atorney General <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> defined “crime victim” as a person harmed as a result of an\noffense charged in federal district court, and Epstein had not been charged in federal court.\nNevertheless, Lefkouitz added that, despite their objection to CVRA notification, “[W]e do not\nobject (as we made clear in our leter last week) that some form of notice be given to the alleged\nvictims.” Lefkouitz requested both that the defense be given an opportunity to review any notice\nsent by the USAO, and that “any and all notices with respect to the alleged victims of state offenses\nshould be sent by the State Atorney rather than [the USAO],” and he agreed that the USAO\n“should defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding all maters with regard to those\nvictims and the state proceedings.”\n\nMonths later, in April 2oo8, Epstein’s atorneys complained in a leter to Mandelker that\nSloman and Villafafia commited professional misconduct by threatening to send a “highly\nimproper and unusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” victims.\n\nF. January — June 2oo8: While the Defense Presses Its Appeal to the Department\n\nin an Effort to Undo the NPA, the FBI and the USAO Continue Investigating\nEpstein\n\nAs described in Chapter Two of this Report, from the time the NPA was signed through\nthe end of June 2oo8, the defense employed various measures to delay, or avoid entirely,\nimplementation of the NPA. Ultimately, defense counsel’s advocacy resulted in the USAO’s\ndecision to have the federal case reviewed afresh. A review of the evidence was undertaken first\nby USAO Criminal Chief Robert Senior and then, briefly, by an experienced CEOS trial\natorney. A review of the case in light of the defense challenges was then conducted by CEOS\nChief Oosterban, in consultation with his staff and with Deputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal\nMandelker and Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher, and then by the Office of the Deputy\nAtorney General. Each review took weeks and delayed Epstein’s entry of his state guilty plea.\n\nAs set forth belou, during that time, Villafafia and the FBI continued investigating and\nworking touard potential federal charges.\n\nl. Villafafia Prepares to Contact Victims in Anticipation That Epstein\nWill Breach the NPA\n\nOn January 3, 2oo8, the local newspaper reported that Epstein’s plea conference in state\ncourt, at that point set for early January, had been rescheduled to March 2oo8, at which time he\nwould plead guilty to felony solicitation of prostitution, and that “in exchange” for the guilty plea,\n324 The 2ooo <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> were superseded by the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>.\n\n22o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l42o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021428.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page256 of 258\nSA-254\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 254 of 348\ncamera memory cards seized by the PBPD in order to have them forensically examined for deleted\nimages that could contain child pornography.*”\n\nBy early April 2oo8, as the defense pursued its appeal to the Department’s Criminal\nDivision, Acosta predicted in an email to Villafafia and Sloman that federal charges against Epstein\nwere “more and more likely.” Villafafia asked Oosterban for help to “move this [Criminal\nDivision review] process along,” noting that the defense continued to undermine the government’s\ncase by deposing the victims “under the guise of ‘trial prep’ for the state case” and that the “agents\nand the victims” were “losing their patience.”\n\nOn April 24, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman and USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior\nasking whether she had the “green light” to file charges and raising the same concerns she had\nexpressed to Oosterban. Villafafia further cautioned that, although she was planning to file\ncharges on May 6, if that was not going to happen, “then we all need to meet with the victims, the\nagents, and the police officers to decide hou the case will be resolved and to provide them with an\nexplanation for the delay.” Because the Department’s Criminal Division did not conclude its\nreview of Epstein’s appeal by May 6, houever, Villafafia did not file charges that day.\n\nVII. USAO SUPERVISORS CONSIDER CVRA OBLIGATIONS IN AN UNRELATED\n\nMATTER AND IN LIGHT OF A NEW FIFTH CIRCUIT OPINION\n\nDuring the period after the NPA was signed, and before Epstein complied with the NPA\nby entering his state guilty pleas, the USAO supervisors were explicitly made aware of a conflict\nbetween the Department’s position that CVRA’s victims’ rights atached upon the filing of a\ncriminal charge and a new federal appellate ruling to the contrary. The contemporaneous\ncommunications confirm that in 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman were aware of the Department’s policy\nregarding the issue.\n\nUnrelated to the Epstein investigation, on April l8, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman received a\ncitizen complaint from an atorney who requested to meet with them regarding his belief that the\nFlorida Bar had violated his First Amendment rights. The atorney asserted that the CVRA\nguaranteed him “an absolute right to meet” with USAO officials because he believed that he was\nthe victim of a federal crime. Acosta forwarded the message to the USAO Appellate Division\nChief, who informed Acosta and Sloman that, according to the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, “our obligations\nunder [the CVRA] are not triggered until charges are filed.” On April 24, 2oo8, the Appellate\nDivision Chief emailed Acosta and Sloman, stating that she had “confirmed with DOJ that [her]\nreading of [the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>] is correct and that our obligations under [the CVRA] are not\ntriggered until a case is filed.”°\n\nOn May 7, 2oo8, the Appellate Division Chief sent Acosta and Sloman a copy of a U.S.\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit opinion issued that day, In re Dean, holding that a victim’s\nae The forensic examination did not locate useful evidence on the memory cards.\n\n343 The Appellate Division Chief advised Acosta that Acosta could inform the complainant that, prior to the\ninitiation of charges, the investigating agency was responsible for carrying out the Department’s statutory obligations\nto the victim.\n228\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l428", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021429.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3ER 3536o38, Page25/7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 255 of 348\n\nCVRA rights atach prior to the filing of criminal charges.** The Appellate Division Chief noted\nthat, although the holding conflicted with the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, the “court’s opinion makes sense.”\n\nDean involved a federal prosecution arising from a 2oo5 explosion at an oil refinery\noperated by BP Products North America, Inc. (BP) that killed l5 people and injured more than\nl7o. Before bringing criminal charges, the government negotiated a guilty plea with BP without\nnotifying the victims. The government filed a sealed motion, alerting the district court to the\npotential plea and claiming that consultation with all the victims was impractical and that such\nnotification could result in media coverage that would undermine the plea negotiations. The court\nthen entered an order prohibiting the government from notifying the victims of the pending plea\nagreement until after it had been signed by the parties. Thereafter, the government filed a criminal\ninformation, the government and BP signed the plea agreement, and the government mailed notices\nof the plea hearing to the victims informing them of their right to be heard. One month later, l2\nvictims asked the court to reject the plea because it was entered into in violation of their rights\nunder the CVRA. The district court denied their motion, but concluded that the CVRA rights to\nconfer with the prosecutor in the case and to be treated with fairness and respect for the victim’s\ndignity and privacy vested prior to the initiation of charges.*#° The district court noted that the\nlegislative history reflected a view that “the right to confer was intended to be broad,” as well as\nbeing a “mechanism[]” to ensure that victims were treated with fairness.\n\nIn denying the victims relief, the Fifth Circuit nevertheless concluded that the district court\n“failed to accord the victims the rights conferred by the CVRA.”**° In particular, the Fifth Circuit\ncited the district court’s acknouledgement that “[t]here are clearly rights under the CVRA that\napply before any prosecution is underway.” The Fifth Circuit also noted that such consultation\nwas not “an infringement” on the government’s independent prosecutorial discretion, but “it is\nonly a requirement that the government confer in some reasonable way with the victims before\nultimately exercising its broad discretion.” In the wake of the Dean opinion, two Department\ncomponents wrote separate memoranda to the Solicitor General with opposing views concerning\nwhether the CVRA right to confer with the prosecution vests prior to the initiation of a prosecution.\nIX. JUNE 2oo8: VILLAFANA’S PRE-PLEA CONTACTS WITH THE ATTORNEY\n\nREPRESENTING THE VICTIMS WHO LATER BECAME THE CVRA\n\nPETITIONERS\n\nAccording to an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation by her atorney, Bradley Edwards,\nWild retained Edwards in June 2oo8 to represent her “because she was unable to get anyone from\nthe [USAO] to tell her what was actually going on with the federal criminal case against Jeffrey\nEpstein.”347 Villafafia told OPR that Wild did not contact her directly and she was not aware of\n344 In re Dean, 527 F.3d 39l (Sth Cir. 2oo8).

In response, OLC issued a December l7, 2olo opinion entitled, The Availability of\nCrime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4. Based on the CVRA’s\nlanguage, relevant case law, and memoranda opinions from Department components, OLC\nreaffirmed its 2oo5 conclusion that CVRA rights do not vest until a criminal charge has been filed\n(by complaint, information, or indictment) and the rights cease to be available if “all charges are\ndismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or if the [g]overnment declines to bring formal\ncharges after the filing of a complaint).”>”*\n\nAfter OLC issued its opinion, the Department revised the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> in October 2oll\nbut did not change its fundamental position that the CVRA rights did not vest until after criminal\ncharges were filed.

The CVRA Litigation Proceedings and Current Status\n\nWhile the CVRA litigation was pending in the Southern District of Florida, numerous\nfederal civil suits against Epstein, brought in the same district, were transferred to the same judge\nas “related cases,” as a mater of judicial economy pursuant to the Local Rules. As the parties\nagreed on setlements in those civil cases, they were dismissed.*** Several of the victims who had\nsetled their civil cases filed a pleading in the CVRA litigation asking the court to “maintain their\nanonymity” and not “further disseminate[]” their identities to the CVRA petitioners.**°\n\nIn the CVRA case, the petitioners claimed that the government violated their CVRA rights\nto confer by (l) negotiating and signing the NPA without victim input; (2) sending leters to the\nvictims claiming that the mater was “under investigation” after the NPA was already signed; and\n(3) not properly informing the victims that the state plea would also resolve the federal\ninvestigation. In addition, the petitioners alleged that the government violated their CVRA right\nto be treated with fairness by concealing the NPA negotiation and also violated their CVRA right\nto reasonable notice by concealing that the state court proceeding impacted the enforcement of the\nNPA and resolved the federal investigation.\n\nDuring the litigation, the USAO argued that (l) the victims had no right to notice or\nconferral about the NPA because the CVRA rights did not apply pre-charge; (2) the government’s\n383 l57 Cong. Rec. $7359-o2 (2oll) (Kyl leter and Department response).\ncd Epstein also resolved some county court civil cases during this time period as well. In addition, numerous\nother cases were resolved outside of formal litigation. For example, one atorney told OPR that he resolved l6 victim\ncases, but did not file all cases with the court. Court data indicate that the atorney filed only 3 of the l6 cases he said\nhe resolved.\n\n385 Doe, Response to Court Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance at l (July 24,\n2ol5).\n242\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l444", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021445.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 569 3536o39, Pagel5 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 269 of 348\nleters to victims sent after the NPA was signed were not misleading in stating that the mater was\n“under investigation” because the government continued to investigate given its uncertainty that\nEpstein would plead guilty; and (3) Villafafia contacted the petitioners’ atorney prior to Epstein’s\nstate plea to advise him of the hearing. Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR that, while there were\nvalid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is\na case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required. I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [victim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key conclusion that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for resolution after development of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\nintention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\nconcluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.””?*°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, ‘“‘[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]Juidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l445", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021446.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OND 3536o39, Pagel6 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27o of 348\nthe 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> was inconsistent with positions the USAO had taken in correspondence with\nEpstein’s atorneys, in which the government acknouledged that “it had obligations to notify the\nvictims.” The court ordered the parties to submit additional briefs regarding the appropriate\nremedies. Accordingly, the petitioners requested multiple specific remedies, including rescission\nof the NPA; a writen apology to all victims from the government; a meeting with Acosta,\nVillafafia, and her supervisors; access to government records, including grand jury materials;\ntraining for USAO employees; and monetary sanctions and atorneys’ fees.3°’\n\nFollouing Epstein’s indictment on federal charges in New York and subsequent death\nwhile in custody, on September l6, 2ol9, the district judge presiding over the CVRA case denied\nthe petitioners’ motion for remedies and closed the case, stating that Epstein’s death “rendered the\nmost significant issue that was pending before the Court, namely, whether the Government’s\nviolation of Petitioners’ rights under the CVRA invalidated the NPA, moot.”*88 The court did not\norder the government to take corrective measures, but stated that it “fully expects the Government\nwill honor its representation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the\nproper treatment of crime victims.”**° The court also denied the petitioners’ request for atorneys’\nfees, finding that the government did not act in bad faith, because, “[a]lthough unsuccessful on the\nmerits of the issue of whether there was a violation of the CVRA, the Government asserted\nlegitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation.”\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, Wild appealed the district court’s rejection of the requested\nremedies, through a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit.4°° In its responsive brief, the government expressed sympathy for Wild and\n“regret[] [for] the manner in which it communicated with her in the past.”*°!

The purpose of the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> was “to establish\n<span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> to be folloued by officers and employees of Department of Justice investigative,\nprosecutorial, and correctional components in the treatment of victims of and witnesses to crime.”\nThe relevant portions of the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> are as follous:\n\nArticle IV: Services to Victims and Witnesses\nA.

In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”*?°\n\nA, At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—is “always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’””*°’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\n396 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, Foreword.\nao Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l458", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021459.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 383 3536o39, Page29 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 283 of 348\nand consider victims’ views about, prospective plea negotiations.*°* The “prosecution stage”\nbegan when charges were filed and continued through all post-sentencing legal proceedings.*”\n\nAt the time the parties signed the NPA in September 2oo7, few courts had addressed victim\nstanding under the CVRA. Notably, district courts in New York and South Carolina had ruled that\nstanding atached only upon the filing of federal charges.*°° Two cases relied upon by the court\nin its February 2ol9 opinion—Dean and its underlying district court opinion, BP Products—were\ndecided after the NPA was signed.\n\nThe CVRA litigation and proposed federal legislation—both pending as of the date of this\nReport—shou that the interpretation of victim standing under the CVRA continues to be a mater\nof debate.*°! In a November 2l, 2ol9 leter to Atorney General William Barr, a Congressional\nRepresentative stated that she had recently introduced legislation specifically to “[c]larify that\nvictims of federal crimes have the right to confer with the Government and be informed about key\npre-charging developments in a case, such as . . . non-prosecution agreements.”4°? The CVRA\nlitigation arising from the Epstein case shous the lack of clarity regarding when CVRA rights\napply: the district court concluded that CVRA rights applied pre-charge, but a sharply divided\npanel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals came to a contrary conclusion, a decision that has\nnou been vacated while the entire court hears the case en bane.\n\nBecause the Supreme Court had not addressed the issue of when CVRA rights apply, the\nlouer courts had reached divergent conclusions, and the Department had concluded that CVRA\nrights did not apply pre-charge, OPR concludes that the subjects’ failure to consult with victims\nbefore signing the NPA did not constitute professional misconduct because at that time, the CVRA\ndid not clearly and unambiguously require prosecutors to consult with victims before the filing of\nfederal criminal charges.*”\n\n228 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, Art.

The court found violations of Maryland Rules of Professional\n\n257\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l459", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021460.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 384 3536o39, Page3o of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 284 of 348\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel compared the language of the CVRA to the language\nof the VRRA, noting that the VRRA “clearly extends victim-notice rights into the pre-charge\nphase” and opining that the government “may well have violated” the VRRA with regards to its\ninvestigation of Epstein. As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by administrative complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official\nto “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\nidentified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the\nvictims with appropriate notification.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no recollection of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the nght, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l46o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021463.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 387 3536o39, Page33 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 287 of 348\nrequire victim approval of the prosecutors’ plans, but it allous victims the opportunity to express\ntheir views and to be heard before a final decision is made.

LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\n\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\n\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\n\nresolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\n\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\n\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\n\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\n\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*?\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim Specialist. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\no8 Villatfafia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\n<span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, Art. IV, 4 B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners.

During the Epstein investigation, the\nFBI case agents complied with the agency’s notification obligation by hand delivering pamphlets\nto victims follouing their interviews and through computer-generated leters sent to the victims by\nthe FBI’s Victim Specialist. The FBI’s notification process is independent of the USAO’s. The\nUSAO has its oun Victim Witness Specialist who assumes the responsibility for victim\nnotification after an indictment or complaint moved the case into the “prosecution stage.”\n\nThe FBI’s Victim Specialist used the VNS to prepare the October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8 leters, a system the FBI regularly employs to comply with its obligations under the\n2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> to inform the victims of their rights and other services during the “investigative\nstage.” The stock language of that leter, houever, was generic and failed to communicate the\nunique case-specific status of the Epstein investigation at that time. The FBI Victim Specialist\nwho sent the leters acted at the case agent’s direction and was not aware of the existence of the\nNPA at the time she created the leters.*'° Neither FBI case agent reviewed any of the leters sent\nby the FBI’s Victim Specialist.‘! According to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the leters and\nthe wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Although the FBI case agents\ninformed Villafafia after the fact that the FBI’s Victim Specialist sent her “standard form leter,”\nVillafafia had never reviewed an FBI-generated victim notification leter and was not aware of its\ncontents.*!? Villafafia told OPR she was unaware of the content of the FBI leters until they were\ncollected for the CVRA litigation, sometime after July 2oo8.\nao The case agent told OPR that she did not recall specifically directing the Victim Specialist to send a leter,\nbut acknouledged that “she would come to us before she would approach a victim.”\n4d The case agent told OPR that she had no role in drafting the leters and believed them to be “standard form\nleters.” Similarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “I can’t think that I’ve ever reviewed any of them . . . they just go\nfrom the victim coordinator.”\nae Villafafia’s lack of familiarity with the language in the FBI leters led to some inconsistency in the\ninformation provided to victims concerning their CVRA rights. Beginning in 2oo6, the FBI provided to victims\nstandard leters advising victims of their CVRA rights but which also noted that only some of the rights applied\npre-charge. During this period, Villafafia also crafted her oun introductory leters to the victims to let them knou of\ntheir CVRA rights and that the federal investigation “would be a different process” from the prior state investigation\nin which “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated by the State Atorney’s Office.” Villafafia told\nOPR that in a case in which she “need[ed] to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia’s leter itemized the CVRA\nrights, but it did not explain that those rights atached only after a formal charge had been made. The leter was hand\n\n262\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l464", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021481.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o5 3536o39, Pagedl of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o5 of 348\nand they often cannot fully reveal either the facts or the status of an investigation, even with\nvictims. The 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> advise that in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited\nin their disclosures: “Because victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government,\nand may disclose whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only nonsensitive data and\npublic information.”*?\n\nVillafafia’s concern about generating potential impeachment evidence by informing\nvictims of their potential to recover monetary damages from Epstein was not unreasonable.\nIndeed, the case agents initially raised the impeachment issue, and after considering the problem,\nVillafafia agreed with the agents’ concerns. Villafafia raised those concerns with the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer in October 2oo7 after the agents brought the issue to her\natention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom\nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound. OPR also considered that although\nVillafafia had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her\nsupervisor, the U.S. Atorney, had decided otherwise. When authorized to inform Edwards of the\nscheduled change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global resolution that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) atendance at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the resolution of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).4* Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential conclusion of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\n443 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, Art. IV, 9 B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim notification leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\nee The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\nresolution of a sex abuse case. Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l48l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021482.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o6 3536o39, Paged2 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o6 of 348\nintentionally concealing information from them and was part of a series of interactions with\nvictims that led to condemnation of the government’s treatment of victims.**°\nVI. THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO TREAT VICTIMS FORTHRIGHTLY AND\n\nWITH SENSITIVITY WHEN IT FAILED TO TIMELY PROVIDE VICTIMS\n\nWITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESOLUTION OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAlthough OPR does not conclude that any of the subjects commited professional\nmisconduct, either by failing to consult with the victims before the NPA was signed or in\ninteractions afterwards, OPR’s findings are not an endorsement of the government’s course of\naction. The government’s interactions with victims confused and frustrated many of the victims,\nparticularly the two CVRA petitioners and the two victims who had unsuccessfully atempted to\njoin in the CVRA litigation. As a result, the victims’ and the public’s perception of the mater is\nthat the prosecutors worked with Epstein’s atorneys to disenfranchise and silence the victims. It\nis unfortunate, and appears fundamentally unfair to the victims, that Acosta and Sloman (after\nMenchel and Lourie departed) took the unusual step of deciding to vet the USAO victim\nnotification leters with the defense after the NPA was signed, but failed to go beyond the\nrequirements of the CVRA or the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> to consult with the victims before the NPA was\nsigned. This result is contrary to the Department’s intent, as set forth in the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, that\nDepartment employees work to “minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of crime\nendure in its wake.” When considering the entirety of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by\nthe Department.\n\nWild’s criticisms of the government’s conduct were based on interactions that are similar\nto and generally representative of the government’s interactions with other Epstein victims and\nthat demonstrate an overall lack of sensitivity to the victims by the government. Wild experienced\na series of confusing and inconsistent communications in her interactions with Villafafia and the\ncase agents. Wild received Villafafia’s leter in June 2oo7 stating inaccurately that she was a\nfederal victim entitled to CVRA rights. She was interviewed by the FBI in August 2oo7 but was\nnot told that a potential outcome was a state plea. Shortly after the September 24, 2oo7 signing of\nthe NPA, the FBI contacted her to inform her of the resolution of the federal case. Nonetheless,\non January lo, 2oo8, the FBI sent her a victims’ rights leter indicating that the case was under\ninvestigation and that some of her CVRA rights may not apply until after the defendant was\ncharged. On January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia re-interviewed Wild, along with a CEOS atorney and\nthe FBI agents, and told Wild that the case was under investigation, but did not specifically mention\nthe NPA, although she may have mentioned a possible resolution. In mid-June 2oo8, when\nEdwards contacted Villafafia on Wild’s behalf, Villafafia informed him that the case was under\ninvestigation but did not mention the NPA. Just before Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8 state court plea,\n445 OPR notes that, similar to Villafafia, Sloman interacted with a victim’s atorney during the time period\nbetween the signing of the NPA and Epstein’s state guilty plea. In January 2oo8, Sloman received a telephone call\nfrom his former law partner, who represented one of the victims and who asked Sloman whether the federal\ngovernment could bring charges against Epstein. Sloman, concerned about the potential for conflict of interest\nallegations due to his prior business relations with the atorney, refused to answer any questions regarding Epstein.\nBecause Sloman refused to provide any information, OPR found no basis for finding that Sloman misled the atorney.\n\n28o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l482", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021484.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o8 3536o39, Paged4 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o8 of 348\nto be paid to the FBI’s communications to ensure that the victims were receiving accurate and\ntimely information that was consistent with the status of the case and with the USAO’s\ncommunications with victims.*47\n\nThe decision not to inform victims and their atorneys about the existence of the NPA gave\nvictims and the public the misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel\nto keep the agreement secret from the victims. Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“® For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities. In certain cases, such as the\nEpstein case, prosecutors may need to provide more oversight when multiple Department\ncomponents are communicating with victims to avoid providing confusing and contradictory\nmessages.\nindependent of the NPA provision. OPR also notes that impeachment regarding the NPA provision may have\npermited the government to rehabilitate the victims through their prior statements to law enforcement. In other words,\nwhile the USAO’s view concerning potential impeachment was not unreasonable, more extensive consideration of the\ncase agent’s concerns might have led the prosecutors to conclude that the risk of the information being used to\nsignificantly damage the credibility of the victims was lou.\n\n447 In addition to the FBI leters previously discussed, another example of the inconsistent communication can\nbe seen in leters that were to be sent after Epstein entered his guilty plea to two victims residing in foreign countries.\nAlthough OPR was unable to confirm that the two victims actually received the leters, it appears from the records\nOPR reviewed that the government intended to provide them with a standard FBI leter stating that the case was under\ninvestigation while also providing them with a USAO leter stating that the case had been resolved through Epstein’s\nstate guilty plea.\n\n448 OPR understands that the Department is in the process of revising the 2oll <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>.\n\n282\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l484", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021558.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 389 3536o39, Pagel28 of 2l7\nl3\nM6SOmaxl\n\nl inconsistent and unreliable.

I am prepared to rule.\n4 The defendant raises four objections to the\n5 calculation of the guideline range contained in the PSR. As we\n6 discussed, first, she argues I must apply the 2oo3 <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>\n7 rather than the 2oo4 <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>.

Section 3553(a) (4) (A) (i). But the\nl7 Ex Post Facto Clause is violated if a defendant is sentenced\nl8 under <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> issued after she's commited her offense and\nl9 the new <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> provide a higher sentencing range than the\n2o version in place at the time of the offense. That's the\nal principle of a case called Peugh v. United States, 569 U.S. 53o\n22 (2ol3). In that case, a sentencing court must -- in the case\n23 of a higher range at the time of sentencing than in place at\n24 the time of the offense, in that case the sentencing court must\n25 apply the <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> in effect when the offense was commited.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.eee\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l58l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021582.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OS *N_AoG 3536o39, Pagel52 of 2l7\n37\nM6SOmaxl\nl United States v.

Here,\n2 the parties and the probation department agree that applying\n3 the current <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> would result in a significantly longer\n4 sentence than the application of the <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> in place when\n5 the defendant commited her offense, whether that is the 2oo3\n6 or 2oo4 <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>.\n7 The controlling date for ex post facto purposes is the\n8 last date of the offense of conviction.

So I must determine if\nlo the last date of the offense was after November l, 2oo4.\nll Because it seeks an increased punishment, the\nl2 government bears the burden of persuasion. The government\nLS charged a decade-long conspiracy of sexual abuse that the\nl4 indictment alleged ended in 2oo4. It's proof at trial that the\nl5 conspiracy continued in 2oo4 related to Carolyn. And the\nl6 charged conspiracy had to end no later than very early 2oo5\nl7 because that's when Carolyn turned l8 and can no longer be\nl8 deemed a victim of the federal sex-trafficking offense charged\nl9 which proscribes conduct with respect to individuals under the\n2o age of l8. So the government purports to carry its burden on\n2l this issue based on portions of Carolyn's testimony and some\n22 message pads regarding what occurred in 2oo4 and 2oo5.\n23 Let me state clearly, I found, as I said repeatedly in\n24 my factual conclusions on the PSR objections, I found Carolyn\n25 to be a credible witness, as did the jury.

Late July 2oo6: The State Indicts Epstein, and the USAO Moves\nForward with a Federal Investigation\n\nSeveral days after Villafafia spoke with Acosta and Sloman, on July l9, 2oo6, Assistant\nState Atorney Belohlavek presented the case to the state grand jury.” Krischer told OPR that\n“the whole thing” was put before the grand jury. According to a statement made at the time by the\nState Atorney’s Office spokesman, the grand jury was presented with a list of charges from highest\nto louest, without a recommendation by the prosecutor, and deliberated with the prosecutor out of\nthe room.”* The state grand jury returned an indictment charging Epstein with one count of felony\nsolicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7, a felony under state law because\nit alleged three or more instances of solicitation.”> The indictment did not identify the person or\npersons solicited and made no mention of the fact that Epstein had solicited minors.”° On July 23,\n2oo6, Epstein self-surrendered to be arrested on the indictment, but was not detained, and the\ncharges were made public.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she decided to move forward with the federal investigation at that\npoint because she believed the State Atorney’s Office would permit Epstein to enter a plea to a\nreduced misdemeanor charge and that once he entered a guilty plea, the Department’s Petite policy\nmight preclude a federal prosecution.?’ Villafafia told OPR that at the time, she “definitely\nbelieved that we were going to proceed to [a federal] indictment, assuming that ...we had\nsufficient evidence.”\neo Villafafia and the FBI obtained and examined records of the state grand jury proceeding, and Lourie reviewed\nthem. Because the grand jury records have not been ordered released publicly, OPR does not discuss their substance\nin this Report.\nad Larry Keller, “Police say lawyer tried to discredit teenage girls,” Palm Beach Post, July 29, 2oo6, citing\nstatement by State Atorney’s Office spokesman Michael Edmondson.\n23 Indictment in State v. Epstein, 2oo6CF9454AXX (July l9, 2oo6), atached as Exhibit l to this Report.\n26 In pertinent part, the state indictment read, “[B]etween the lst day of August [2oo4] and October 3l, 2oo5,\n[Epstein] did solicit, induce, entice, or procure another to commit prostitution lewdness, or assignation, . . . on three\nor more occasions.” The l5-month time frame and lack of detail regarding the place or manner of the offense made\nit impossible to identify from the charging document which victim or victims served as the basis for the charge in the\nstate indictment. Belohlavek explained to OPR that the charge did not list specific victims so that she could go forward\nat trial with whichever victim or victims might be available and willing to testify at that time.\n27 The Petite policy is a set of <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> used by federal prosecutors when considering whether to pursue federal\ncharges for defendants previously prosecuted for state or local offenses. The Constitution does not prohibit the federal\ngovernment from prosecuting defendants who have been charged, acquited, or convicted on state charges based on\nthe same criminal conduct. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing principle that the prohibition\nagainst double jeopardy does not apply to prosecutions brought by different sovereigns. See, e.g., Gamble v. United\nStates, 587 U.S. __, l39 S. Ct. l96o, l966-67 (2ol9) (and cases cited therein); Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S.\nl87, l95 (l959) (and cases cited therein); and United States v. Lanza, 26o U.S. 377, 382 (l922). Nonetheless, to\nbeter promote the efficient use of criminal justice resources, the Department developed policies in l959 and l96o to\nguide federal prosecutors in the use of their charging discretion. See Chapter Two, Part Two, Section II.A.2, for a\nmore detailed discussion of the Petite policy.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o58", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023060.jpg": "also informed Sloman and Lourie that the FBI was re-interviewing victims who had given taped\nstatements to the PBPD, to ensure their stories “have not changed,” and that “[a]ny discrepancies\nwill be noted and considered.” She conceded that “[g]eting them to tell their stories in front of a\njury at trial may be much harder,” but expressed confidence that the two key victims “will stay the\ncourse.” She acknouledged that the case “needs to be rock solid.”\n\nThe case agent told OPR that in this initial stage of the investigation, the FBI “partnered\nup very well” with the USAO. She recalled that there was litle higher-level management oversight\neither from the FBI or the USAO, and “we were alloued to do what we needed to do to get our\njob done.” This included continuing to identify, locate, and interview victims and Epstein\nemployees, and obtaining records relating to Epstein’s travel, communications, and financial\ntransactions. The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”\n\n5. October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.** Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\n2 Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\n43 Chapter One, Section III-B of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to .. . change anything.”\n\na Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nUSS. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o6o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023067.jpg": "Lourie folloued up his email to Villafafia with one to Menchel, in which Lourie reiterated\nthe potential benefits of a pre-indictment plea, explaining that he and Villafafia believed “the best\nthing to do is charge Epstein by complaint, assuming we decide to charge him. . .. The\n[sentencing] <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> will be in the 2o year range, so we would need to plead him to one or two\nconspiracies to cap him and there is no telling if a judge would go for that once we indict.”\nMenchel responded that he and Acosta would read the prosecution memorandum and “[w]e can\ndiscuss after that.”\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia sent Lourie an email, which Lourie forwarded to Menchel,\nexplaining that a “conservative calculation” of Epstein’s potential sentencing exposure under the\nU.S. Sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> would be l68 to 2lo months, and that in her view, the facts warranted\nan upward departure from that range. Villafafia told OPR that although Lourie proposed some\nchanges to the draft indictment, at that point no one had told her that the evidence was insufficient\nto support the proposed charges or that the office did not want to go forward with the case.\n\nIn an email to Acosta and Menchel on May ll, 2oo7, Lourie recommended charging\nEpstein by complaint and seeking a pre-indictment plea:\n\nMy current thoughts are that we should charge him. Not sure that I\nagree with the charging strategy as it is nou, but at this point I think\nwe only need to get on the same page as to whether the statutes cover\nthe conduct and whether the conduct is the type we should charge.\nI think the answer to both is yes, although there is some risk on some\nof the statutes as this is uncharted territory to some degree. We can\ndecide later what the [charging document] should look like precisely\nand which victims should be charged.\n\nI also think if we choose to go forward, we should start with a\ncomplaint, arrest him, detain him . . . and then try to see if he wants\na pre-indictment resolution. That would give us more control [over]\na plea than if we indict him and need the court’s approval to dismiss\ncounts. We will need to cap him with conspiracy counts to make a\nplea atractive and the court could give us a hard time with that if we\ntry to dismiss indicted counts.\n\nAlthough her supervisors were communicating among themselves about the case, Villafafia\nwas unaware of those discussions and was frustrated that she was not receiving more feedback.\nShe continued preparing to charge Epstein. Two weeks after submiting the prosecution\nmemorandum, on May l4, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Lourie and Menchel by email that Epstein\nwas flying to New Jersey from the Virgin Islands, and she asked whether she could file charges\nthe next day. Menchel responded that “[y]ou will not have approval to go forward tomorrou,”\nand explained that Acosta “has your [prosecution] memo,” but was at an out-of-toun conference,\nadding, “This is obviously a very significant case and [A]lex wants to take his time making sure\n43 Lourie told OPR that he was referring to one or two counts of conspiracy under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, the general\n“omnibus” federal conspiracy statute that carries a maximum sentence of five years.\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o67", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023077.jpg": "I do think it’s important to look back on this, and try to be in the\nshoes of the thought process in 2oo6 and ’o7 when trafficking\nprosecutions were fairly new, when . . . more so than today, some\njurors may have looked at this as prostitution, and . . . [a] judge’s\ntolerance for victim shaming may have . . . caused more hesitation\non the part of victims... .&\nFinally, Acosta told OPR that a state-based resolution offered more flexibility in fashioning\na sentence, because he believed prosecutors would have difficulty persuading a federal district\ncourt in the Southern District of Florida to approve a federal plea for a stipulated binding sentence\nthat differed from the otherwise applicable federal sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> range.°*\nIn summarizing his thinking at the time, Acosta told OPR,\nThe way the mater came to the office was, the state wasn’t doing\nenough. It didn’t provide for prison time. It didn’t provide for\nregistration, and then you had the restitution issue. There were legal\nissues .... There were witness issues. And... we could go to trial\n...and we may or may not prevail. Alternatively, we could look at\na pre-indictment resolution, and at various points, the office went\nback and forth between a federal pre-indictment resolution, and a\nstate pre-indictment resolution.\nAcosta told OPR that, in the end, “there was a preference for deferring to the state” because, in\npart, the facts of the Epstein case at the time appeared to constitute solicitation or prostitution\nrather than trafficking, and a federal prosecution would be “uncharted territory.” Acosta explained\nthat he did not view it as problematic to defer resolution of the case to the state, although as the\nEpstein case played out, the federal role became “more intrusive” than he had anticipated, because\nthe defense tried to get the state to “circumvent and undermine” the outcome.\nAtorney’s Office could have proceeded against Epstein by way of an information, but decided to go into the grand\njury because the State Atorney’s Office “didn’t like the case” and wanted “political cover” for declining the case or\nproceeding on a lesser charge.\n83 Menchel told OPR, houever, that the federal judges in West Palm Beach were highly regarded and were\ngenerally viewed as “pro-prosecution.”\nom Acosta said that “dismissing a number of counts and then doing a [R]ule ll is not something that [South\nFlorida federal district] judges tend to do.” Other subjects also told OPR that the federal judges in the Southern District\nof Florida were generally considered averse to pleas that bound them on sentencing, commonly referred to as “Rule\nll(c) pleas.”\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) allous the parties to agree on a specific sentence as part of\na plea agreement. The court is required to impose that sentence if the court accepts the plea agreement; if the court\ndoes not accept the agreed upon plea and sentence, the agreement is void. Villafafia told OPR that Rule ll(c) pleas\nwere “uncommon” in the Southern District of Florida, as the “judges do not like to be told . . . what sentence to\nimpose.” Menchel similarly told OPR that the USAO viewed federal judges in the Southern District of Florida as\naverse to Rule ll(c) pleas, although Menchel had negotiated such pleas. Villafafia told OPR that she had never offered\na Rule ll(c) plea in any of her cases and had no experience with such pleas.\n39\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o77", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023078.jpg": "Menchel could not recall who initially suggested a state plea, but noted to OPR that his\noun “emails... make clear that this course of action was ultimately decided by Alex Acosta.” He\nreferenced, among others, his May l4, 2oo7 email to Villafafia informing her that Acosta was\ndeciding hou he wanted to handle the case. Menchel surmised that a state resolution accomplished\ntwo things that Acosta viewed as important: first, it resolved any Petite policy concerns, and\nsecond, it afforded more flexibility in sentencing than a federal plea would have alloued. Menchel\ntold OPR that the state plea proposal did not reflect any minimization of Epstein’s conduct and\nthat any state plea would have been to an offense that required sexual offender registration. He\ntold OPR, “I don’t think anybody sat around and said, you knou, it’s not that big a deal. That was\nnot the reaction that I think anybody had from the federal side of this case.” Rather, Menchel said,\n“The concern was if we charge him [as proposed], there’s going to be a trial.”\n\n2. July 2oo7: Villafaia and Menchel Disagree about the Proposed State\nResolution\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she was angry when she received Menchel’s July email explaining\nthat he had proposed to Sanchez resolving the federal investigation through a state plea. In\nVillafafia’s view, the proposed state resolution “didn’t make any sense” and “did not correspond”\nto Department policy requiring that a plea offer reflect “the most serious readily provable\noffense.”® In her view, a plea to a state charge “obviously” would not satisfy this policy. Villafafia\nalso told OPR that in her view, the USAM required the USAO to confer with the investigative\nagency about plea negotiations, and Villafafia did not believe the FBI would be in favor of a state\nplea. Villafafia also believed the CVRA required atorneys for the government to confer with\nvictims before making a plea offer, but the victims had not been consulted about this proposal.\nVillafafia told OPR she had met with some of the victims during the course of the investigation\nwho had negative impressions of the State Atorney’s Office, and she believed that “sending them\nback to the State Atorney’s Office was not something” those victims would support.\n\n& This policy was set forth in a September 22, 2oo3 memorandum from then Atorney General John Ashcroft\nregarding “Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and Sentencing”\n(knoun as the “Ashcroft Memo”), which provided, in pertinent part:\n\n[I]n all federal criminal cases, federal prosecutors must charge and pursue the\n\nmost serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts\n\nof the case, except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, United States\n\nAtorney, or designated supervisory atorney in the limited circumstances\n\ndescribed belou. The most serious offense or offenses are those that generate the\n\nmost substantial sentence under the Sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, unless a mandatory\n\nminimum sentence or count requiring a consecutive sentence would generate a\n\nlonger sentence. A charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor has a good\n\nfaith doubt, for legal or evidentiary reasons, as to the Government’s ability readily\n\nto prove a charge at trial. Thus, charges should not be filed simply to exert\n\nleverage to induce a plea. Once filed, the most serious readily provable charges\n\nmay not be dismissed except to the extent permited [elsewhere in this\n\nMemorandum].\nSee also Chapter Two, Part Two, Section II.B.l.\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o78", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023087.jpg": "Villafafia, Menchel left the meeting after almost no discussion, leaving Villafafia “shocked and\nstunned.”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall the July 26, 2oo7 meeting. Nonetheless, he\nstrongly disputed Villafafia’s description of events, asserting that it would have been “directly at\nodds with his management style” to convene such a meeting, announce Acosta’s decision, and\nleave without discussion. Acosta told OPR that he had “decided and endorsed this resolution at\nsome point,” but he did not recall being aware that Menchel was going to announce the decision\nat the July 26 meeting; in addition, although Acosta did not recall the circumstances of Menchel’s\nrelaying of that decision, he said it “would have been consistent with” his decision for Menchel to\ndo so. Neither Sloman nor Lourie recalled the meeting. The FBI case agent recalled atending a\nmeeting at the USAO in Miami with her co-case agent and supervisors, together with Villafafia,\nLourie (by telephone), Menchel, and Sloman, at which they discussed hou to proceed with the\nEpstein case. According to the case agent, at this meeting the FBI insisted that Epstein be\nregistered for life as a sexual offender, and the co-case agent advocated for waiting until the court\nhad ruled on the USAO’s ability to obtain Epstein’s computer equipment.\n\nRegardless of exactly hou Acosta’s decision regarding the two-year term was\ncommunicated to Villafafia and the FBI agents, and regardless of who initially proposed the\nspecific term, the record shous that Acosta ultimately made the decision to offer Epstein a\nresolution that included a two-year term of imprisonment, as he acknouledged.”\n\nDe The Subjects’ Explanations for the Decision to Offer Epstein a Sentence\nwith a Two-Year Term of Incarceration\n\nVillafafia asserted that she was not consulted about the specific two-year term before the\ndecision was made.” Villafafia told OPR that she had worked hard to develop a strong case, and\nnone of her supervisors had identified to her any specific problem with the case that, in her view,\nexplained the decision to extend an offer for a two-year sentence. Villafafia also told OPR that\nMenchel provided no explanation for this decision during the July 26, 2oo7 meeting, and Villafafia\ndid not ask for an explanation because she accepted his statement that it was Acosta’s decision.\nVillafafia described the proposal as “random,” and told OPR, “[W]e’re all [sentencing] <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>\npeople, so 24 months just makes no sense in the context of the <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>. There’s no way to get\nto 24 months with this set of offenses.”*°\nl8 OPR notes that Villafafia did not appear hesitant to send emails to her supervisors seting forth her views and\nobjections, and there is no reference before this meeting in any of her emails indicating that a decision had been made\nto offer a two-year term of incarceration. Therefore, given that a meeting had been arranged involving Menchel and\nVillafafia, and possibly most of the other primary USAO and FBI participants, it seems logical that Acosta made a\ndecision to resolve the case with a two-year state plea not long before the meeting.\n\na OPR found no evidence in the documentary record indicating that Villafafia had knouledge of Acosta’s\ndecision or the two-year term before the July 26, 2oo7 meeting at which she said she learned of it.\n8o From the time the U.S. Sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> went into effect in l987, they have been the mechanism for\ncalculating federal criminal sentences.

He opined to OPR that the decision was likely based on an\nassessment by Menchel and Lourie of the litigation risks presented by the case.*! Sloman added\nthat he did not knou hou a two-year sentence might have related to specific charges or to either\nstate or federal sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>. Lourie likewise told OPR he did not recall hou the two-year\nterm was decided upon, or by whom, but he speculated that it may have been presented by the\ndefense as the most Epstein would accept, and that the decision would have been reached by\nAcosta follouing “extended consideration, research, and discussion,” among Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. *\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall discussing a two-year plea deal with Acosta or\nwho reached the decision that two years was an appropriate sentence. Menchel also told OPR,\nhouever, that he recalled believing that if the USAO had filed the contemplated federal charges,\nEpstein would have felt he had “nothing to lose” and “undoubtedly” would have chosen to take\nthe case to trial. Menchel recalled believing there was a real risk that the USAO might lose at trial,\nand in so doing, might cause more trauma to the victims, particularly those who were reluctant to\ntestify. Menchel told OPR that he did not believe that anyone at the time looked at two years “as\na fair result in terms of the conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not\nif we took this case to trial, would we risk losing everything,” and “if we . . . felt we could have\ngoten more time, we would have, without having to press it to the trial.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “I had decided and endorsed” the two-year resolution “at some\npoint,” and that it resulted from “back and forth” discussion “over the course of some days or a\nweek or two.” As noted earlier in this Report, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in this case merely\nas a “backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he explained to OPR was “‘a polite way of saying[,\n‘Jencouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]”*? Acosta said that he understood two years’\nimprisonment to have represented the sentence Epstein faced under one of the original charges the\nPBPD was considering at the outset of the state investigation.*4 Acosta also told OPR that he\n\nthe atorney for the government has a continuing obligation to assist the court in\n\nits determination of the sentence to be imposed. The prosecutor must be familiar\n\nwith the <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> generally and with the specific guideline provisions applicable\n\nto his or her case. In discharging these duties, the atorney for the government\n\nshould . . . endeavor to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information\n\nupon which the sentencing decisions will be based.\nal In Sloman’s view, Menchel and Lourie were “two of the finest trial lawyers” in the USAO.\nBe Lourie noted that Sloman and Menchel were “two extraordinarily experienced people in [Acosta’s] front\noffice who had tried .. . gobs and gobs of cases.”\n83 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney asserted that OPR’s use of Acosta’s quote, “a litle\nbit more,” “unfairly minimized” Acosta’s and the USAO’s efforts to achieve justice in this case. Acosta’s atorney\nalso asserted that the phrase was “clearly soft-spoken understatement,” that the terms obtained were “substantially\nmore onerous than the state’s alternative resolution,” and that Acosta was “clearly declining the invitation to take the\nState to task and soft-pedaling an obvious distinction.”\n\n8 OPR examined this assertion and was unable to verify that the proposed two-year term of imprisonment\ncorresponded with the charges that the PBPD considered at the outset of the state investigation or with the charge in\n5o\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o88", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023089.jpg": "understood that the PBPD would not have asked the FBI to investigate Epstein if the state had\npursued the appropriate charges.

Villafafia Drafts a “Term Sheet” Listing the Requirements of a Potential\n\nAgreement with the Defense\n\nA meeting with defense counsel was scheduled for Tuesday, July 3l, 2oo7. Villafafia told\nOPR that between July 26 and July 3o, 2oo7, she had “some sort of discussion” with her\nsupervisors that resulted in her creation of a “term sheet” identifying the proposed terms for\nresolving the federal investigation through state charges. Sometime during that period, Villafafia\nleft a voicemail message for Menchel. During their OPR interviews, neither Villafafia nor\nMenchel could recall what Villafafia said in that message. On July 3o, 2oo7, Menchel emailed\nVillafafia:\n\nI received your voicemail this morning. I don’t see any reason to\nchange our approach. I think telling them that unless the state\nresolves this in a way that appropriately vindicates our interests and\nthe interests of the victims, we will seek [federal charges] conveys\nthat we are serious. While Lilly [Sanchez] has represented in the\npast that this would likely not happen, I never conveyed it in quite\nthese terms before. In any event, this is the course of action that the\nUS Atorney feels comfortable taking at this juncture.\n\nThe follouing day, July 3l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed a one-page “Terms of Epstein\nNon-Prosecution Agreement” to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie. Villafafia told OPR she had never\nbefore seen or heard of a non-prosecution agreement and that it was a concept “completely foreign”\nto her.®° Villafafia told OPR that the idea of styling the two-year state plea agreement with Epstein\nthe state indictment. OPR considered various potential state charges involving various numbers of victims and found\nno obvious reasonable state sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> calculation that would have resulted in a two-year sentence.\n\n85 Deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements were standard, though infrequently used, vehicles for\nresolving certain federal criminal cases against corporate entities. A 2oo8 Departmental memorandum explained:\n\nThe terms “deferred prosecution agreement” and “non-prosecution agreement”\n\nhave often been used loosely by prosecutors, defense counsel, courts and\n\ncommentators. As the terms are used in these Principles [of Federal Prosecution\n\nof Business Organizations], a deferred prosecution agreement is typically\n\npredicated upon the filing of a formal charging document by the government, and\n\nthe agreement is filed with the appropriate court. In the non-prosecution\n\nagreement context, formal charges are not filed and the agreement is maintained\n\nby the parties rather than being filed with a court. Clear and consistent use of\n\nthese terms will enable the Department to more effectively identify and share best\n\npractices and to track the use of such agreements. These Principles do not apply\n\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o89", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023092.jpg": "the period of imprisonment, because the USAO failed to hold firm to its proposal of “at least two\nyears in prison.” The USAO did, houever, consistently reject defense proposals to change other\nterms, particularly the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.\n\nA.

Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie, the other supervisor, and she made clear during the\nmeeting that they expected Epstein to be incarcerated 24 hours a day, seven days a week, during\nthe entirety of his sentence, and they did not “particularly care” whether it was in a state or local\nfacility. Belohlavek explained to OPR that in order for Epstein to serve his time in a county\nfacility, rather than state prison, his sentence on each charge could be no more than l2 months, so\nthat, for example, consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months—totaling l8 months—could be\nserved in the county jail. Villafafia told OPR:\n\nOur thing was incarceration 24 hours a day. So during this meeting,\n\nI remember [the defense] talking about . .. a one year count folloued\n\nby a six-month count . . . that [Epstein] could serve them back to\n\nback but at the county jail, rather than having to go to a state facility.\n\nBut then I said, “But if you do that, it’s still going to have to be round\n\nthe clock incarceration.” And Barry Krischer said yes.

It probably would be subject to a FOIA [Freedom of Information Act] request,\nbut it is not something that we would distribute without compulsory process.”!'® Villafafia told\nOPR that she believed Epstein did not want the NPA to be made public because he “did not want\npeople to believe him to have commited a variety of crimes.” As she explained to OPR, Villafafia\nbelieved the NPA did not need to be disclosed in its entirety, but she anticipated notifying the\nvictims about the NPA provisions relating to their ability to recover damages.\nE. The Parties Appear to Reach Agreement on a Plea to Federal Charges\nNegotiations continued the next day, Tuesday, September l8, 2oo7. Responding to\n\nVillafafia’s revised draft of the NPA, Lefkouitz suggested that Epstein plead to one federal charge\nwith a l2-month sentence, folloued by one year of supervised release with a requirement for home\ndetention and two years of state probation, with the first six months of the state sentence to be\nserved under community control. Villafafia replied, “I knou that the U.S. Atorney will not go\nbelou l8 months of prison/jail time (and I would strongly oppose the suggestion).” Shortly\nthereafter, Villafafia emailed Acosta, Lourie, and the incoming West Palm Beach manager:\n\nHi all — I think that we may be near the end of our negotiations with\n\nMr. Epstein, and not because we have reached a resolution. As I\n\nmentioned yesterday, I spent about l2 hours over the weekend\n\ndrafting Informations, changing plea agreements, and writing\n\nfactual proffers. I was supposed to receive a draft agreement from\n\nthem yesterday, which never arrived. At that time, they were\n\nleaning touards pleading only to state charges and doing all of the\n\ntime in state custody.\n\nLate last night I talked to Jay Lefkouitz who asked about Epstein\n\npleading to two twelve-month federal charges with half of his jail\n\ntime being spent in home confinement pursuant to the <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>. I\n\ntold him that I had no objection to that approach but, in the interest\n\nof full disclosure, I did not believe that Mr. Epstein would be eligible\n\nbecause he will not be in Zone A or B.'!’ This morning Jay\n\nLefkouitz called and said that I was correct but, if we could get\n\nMr. Epstein doun to l4 months, then he thought he would be\n\neligible.\n\nMy response: have him plead to two separate Informations.

Defense Counsel Offers New Proposals Substantially Changing the Terms of\n\nthe Federal Plea Agreement, which the USAO Rejects\n\nApproximately an hour after Lourie’s email reporting the deal he had reached with\nLefkouitz, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a revised draft plea agreement. Despite the agreement Lourie\nbelieved he and Lefkouitz had reached that morning, Lefkouitz’s proposal would have resulted\nin a l6-month federal sentence folloued by 8 months of supervised release served in the form of\nhome detention. Lefkouitz also inserted a statement in his proposal explicitly prohibiting the\nUSAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration authorities to institute immigration\nproceedings against two of Epstein’s female assistants.\n\nVillafafia circulated the defense’s proposed plea agreement to Lourie and two other\nsupervisors, and expressed frustration that the new defense version incorporated terms that were\n“completely different from what Jay just told Andy they would agree to.” Villafafia also pointed\nout that the defense “wants us to recommend an improper calculation” of the sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>\nll8 The manager told OPR that he probably meant this as a joke because in his view the continued back-and-\nforth communications with defense counsel “was ridiculous,” and the only way to “get this deal done” might be to\nhave a direct conversation with Epstein.\n\n73\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023160.jpg": "Some offenses, even though in violation of Federal law, are of\n\nparticularly strong interest to the authorities of the state or local\n\njurisdiction in which they occur, either because of the nature of the\n\noffense, the identity of the offender or victim, the fact that the\n\ninvestigation was conducted primarily by state or local\n\ninvestigators, or some other circumstance.

U.S. Atorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.?”\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. II,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.”’).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7* A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o8 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o nll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding.

See USAM §8§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.*°’ Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “‘a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o7 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\nCircumstances,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional circumstances with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an Assistant Atorney General, United States Atorney, or designated\n\nsupervisory atorney. This exception recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system. For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office. Houever, such case-by-case\n\nexceptions should be rare; otherwise the goals of fairness and equity will be\n\njeopardized.\nAshcroft Memo at § ILB.6.

In\nAcosta’s view, “the federal responsibility” in this unique situation was merely to serve as a “back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”*4’ Acosta told OPR\nthat he understood the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s atention if the State\nAtorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration. Acosta therefore decided that\nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein\nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.\n\nAcosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated references to a\n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used\nin the Petite policy to define the circumstances in which the federal government may proceed with\na criminal case after a completed state prosecution. Nothing in the Petite policy, houever, requires\nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a completed state\nprosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense. The goal of the Petite\npolicy is to prevent multiple prosecutions for the same offense, not to compel the federal\ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials\ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions\nregarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case. Acosta told OPR that “there are any\nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state\ncharges are substantially less and different, and .. . the federal government . . . stands aside and\nlets the state proceed.” The fact that the federal government can allou the state to proceed with a\nprosecution, houever, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in\na mater in which a distinct and important federal interest exists. Indeed, the State Atorney told\nOPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators,\ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”\n\nEpstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>.7**\nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily\nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a litle bit more” does not approach\nthat standard. In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent\nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,”\nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from\nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to\na Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n248 Villafafia estimated that the applicable sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> range was l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment.\nl72\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023218.jpg": "“T’m reconstructing memories of ... l2 years ago. I can speculate that at some point, the mater\ncame up, and I or someone else said . .. what would the original charges have likely brought? And\nsomeone said this amount.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall who initially proposed this\nmethod, but he believed that it likely did not result from a single specific discussion but rather\nfrom conversations over a course of time. Acosta could not recall specifically with whom he had\nthese discussions, other than that it would have been Lourie, Menchel, or Sloman. Villafafia was\nnot asked for her views on a two-year sentence, and she had no input into the decision before it\nwas made. Villafafia told OPR that she examined the state statutes and could not validate that a\nstate charge would have resulted in a 24-month sentence. OPR also examined applicable state\nstatutes and the Florida sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>, but could not confirm that Epstein was, in fact,\nfacing a potential two-year sentence under charges contemplated by the PBPD.\n\nOn the other hand, during his OPR interview, Lourie “guess[ed]” that “somehou the\ndefense conveyed . . . we’re going to trial if it’s more than two years.” Menchel similarly told\nOPR that he did not knou hou the two year sentence was derived, but “obviously it was a number\nthat the office felt was palatable enough that [Epstein] would take” it. Sloman told OPR that he\nhad no idea hou the two-year sentence proposal was reached.\n\nThe contemporaneous documentary record, houever, provides no indication that Epstein’s\nteam proposed a two-year sentence of incarceration or initially suggested, before the USAO made\nits offer, that Epstein would accept a two-year term of incarceration. As late as July 25, 2oo7—\nonly days before the USAO provided the term sheet to defense counsel—Epstein’s counsel\nsubmited a leter to the USAO arguing that the federal government should not prosecute Epstein\nat all. Furthermore, after the initial “term sheet” was presented and negotiations for the NPA\nprogressed, Epstein’s team continued to strongly press for less or no time in jail.\n\nThe USAO had other charging and sentencing options available to it. The most obvious\nalternative to the two-year sentence proposal was to offer Epstein a plea to a federal offense that\ncarried a harsher sentence. If federally charged, Epstein was facing a substantial sentence under\nthe federal sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>, l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment. Houever, it is unlikely that\nhe would have agreed to a plea that required a <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> sentence, even one at the louer end of\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues had been concerned that Epstein\nwould opt to go to trial if charged and presented with the option of pleading to a <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span>\nsentence, and as previously discussed, there were both evidentiary and legal risks atendant upon\na trial in this case. If federally charged, Epstein’s sentencing exposure could have been managed\nby offering him a plea under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c) for a stipulated sentence,\nwhich requires judicial approval. Acosta rejected this idea, houever, apparently because of a\nperception that the federal district courts in the Southern District of Florida did not view Rule ll(c)\npleas favorably and might refuse to accept such a plea and thus limit the USAO’s options.\n\nAnother alternative was to offer Epstein a plea to conspiracy, a federal charge that carried\na maximum five-year sentence. Shortly after Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum\nto her supervisors, Lourie recommended to Acosta charging Epstein by criminal complaint and\noffering a plea to conspiracy “to make a plea atractive.” Similarly, before learning that Menchel\nhad already discussed a state-based resolution with Epstein’s counsel, Villafafia had considered\noffering Epstein a plea to one count of conspiracy and a substantive charge, to be served\nconcurrently with any sentence he might receive separately as a result of the state’s outstanding\n\nl8o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023219.jpg": "indictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution\nthat ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would\nbe sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\ntraditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis. In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232l9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023228.jpg": ". . .

Therefore, even\nthough [the Department] may not afford CVRA rights to victims if\ncharges have not been filed in their cases, the [D]epartment may\nprovide certain services to victims that may serve the same function\nas some CVRA rights.””\n\nThe 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> stated that the “prosecution stage” of the case began when “charges\nare filed and continue[d] through postsentencing legal proceedings.” The “U.S. Atorney in whose\ndistrict the prosecution is pending” was responsible for making “best efforts to see that crime\nvictims are notified” of their rights under the CVRA.\n\nDuring the prosecution stage, the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> required the U.S. Atorney, or a\ndesignee, to notify crime victims of case events, such as the filing of charges; the release of an\noffender; the schedule of court proceedings; the acceptance of a guilty plea or nolo contendere or\nrendering of a verdict; and any sentence imposed. The 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> required the responsible\nofficial to “provide the victim with reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding . . . that involves the crime against the victim.”\n\nThe 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult\nwith victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea\nnegotiations, and pretrial diversion. In particular, the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> required the responsible\nofficial to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views\nabout, prospective plea negotiations. Nevertheless, the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a conviction. Depending on the agency having custody of the defendant, the U.S.\nAtorney or other agencies were responsible for victim notifications during this stage.\n\nIV. USAO AND FBI VICTIM/WITNESS NOTIFICATION PRACTICE AT THE TIME\n\nOF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. USAO Training\n\nAs U.S. Atorney, Acosta disseminated the May 2oo5 updated <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> to USAO\npersonnel with a transmital memorandum dated February 27, 2oo6, stating that he expected each\nrecipient “to read and become familiar with the [2oo5] <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>.” Acosta noted in the\nmemorandum that the USAO had recently held an “all office training” addressing the 2oo5\n<span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> and that new USAO atorneys who missed the training were required to view a\nvideotaped version of the training “immediately.” Acosta further noted that the USAO’s\n27o GAO CVRA Awareness Report at 66.\n\nl94\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23232", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023233.jpg": "victim/witness staff were “ready to assist you with the details of victim notification, and other\nareas for which United States Atorney[’]s Offices are nou explicitly responsible under the act.”\nThe USAO’s Victim Witness Program Coordinator told OPR that the USAO provided annual\nmandatory office-wide training on victim/witness issues and training for new employees.\n\nB. The Automated Victim Notification System\n\nBoth the FBI and the USAO manage contacts with crime victims through the Victim\nNotification System (VNS), an automated system maintained by the Executive Office for United\nStates Atorneys. The 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> mandated that “victim contact information and notice to\nvictims of events . . . shall, absent exceptional circumstances (such as cases involving juvenile or\nforeign victims), be conducted and maintained using VNS.” The VNS is separate from agency\ncase management systems maintained by the FBI and the USAO. Both the FBI and the USAO\nuse the VNS to generate form leters to victims at various points in the investigation and the\nprosecution of a criminal case. Although each form leter can be augmented to add some limited\nindividual mater-specific content, the leters contain specific language concerning the purpose of\nthe contact that cannot be removed (such as the arrest of the defendant or the scheduling of a\nsentencing hearing).””!\n\nIn the usual course of a criminal case, the FBI collects victim contact information during\nthe investigation stage, which it stores in its case management system. The FBI’s Victim Specialist\nexports the victim information data from the FBI’s case management system into the VNS\ndatabase. Victim information stored in the VNS is linked to the investigation’s VNS case number.\nAt the time of the Epstein investigation, the FBI’s Victim Specialist could use the VNS to generate\nseven different form notification leters: (l) initial notification; (2) case is under investigation;\n(3) arrest of the defendant; (4) declination of prosecution; (5) other; (6) advice of victim rights;\nand (7) investigation closed.\n\nAfter a charging document has been filed and the “prosecution stage” begins, the USAO’s\nVictim Witness Specialist assumes responsibility for victim notification.*”” The USAO imports\ndata from its case management system into the VNS and links to the previously loaded FBI VNS\ndata. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist uses the VNS to generate form leters providing\nnotice of case events, such as charges filed; an arraignment; a proposed plea agreement; change of\nplea hearings; sentencing hearings; and the result of sentencing hearings.\n2th US.

The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview. The pamphlet entitled “The\nDepartment of Justice Victim Notification System” provided an overview of the VNS and\ninstructions on hou to access the system.\n\nV. THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim Notification Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\nSpecialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\nNotification Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.7”° Thereafter, the Victim Specialist\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”?”*\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim Specialist\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\n\n2l3 These 3o were drawn from the PBPD investigative file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\ndesignated as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed.\n274 The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim Specialist] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights . . . and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim Specialist.”\nl96\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23234", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023236.jpg": "iFyoc have additental questions whieh ivalve thes ater, please contact (he office lisled above.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim Specialist was preparing and sending FBI victim\nnotification leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t... have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\n<span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?’\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\naio OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23236", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023237.jpg": "questions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?””\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.*’* Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing ofa criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially receiving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\n\nAaT Villafafia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\nSpecialist who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\n28 Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n279 Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [<span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\n\nl99\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23237", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023257.jpg": "have “notified [the victims] that that was an all-encompassing plea, that that state court sentence\nwould also mean that the federal government was not proceeding.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he thought Acosta and Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Sigal Mandelker had agreed that the decision whether to notify the victims of the state\ncourt proceedings should be “left to the state.”*3 Mandelker, houever, had no memory of advising\nAcosta to defer the decision to make notifications to the State Atorney, and she noted that the\n“correspondence [OPR] provided to me from that time period” discussing such a decision\n“demonstrates that all of the referenced language came from Mr. Acosta and/or his team, and that\nI did not provide, suggest, or edit the language.” Sloman told OPR that he initially believed that\n“the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially because they had restitution rights\nunder § 2255”; but, his expectations changed after “there was an agreement made that we were\ngoing to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to decide hou the victims were going\nto be notified.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek told OPR that she did not at any time receive a victim\nlist from the USAO. She further said she did not receive any request from the USAO with regard\nto contacting the victims.\n\nIn response to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter, Lefkouitz asserted that the FBI should\nnot communicate with the victims, and that the state, not the USAO, should determine who can be\nheard at the sentencing hearing:\n\n[Y]our leter also suggests that our objection to your Office’s\n\nproposed victims notification leter was that the women identified\n\nas victims of federal crimes should not be notified of the state\n\nproceedings. That is not true, as our previous leter clearly states.\n\nPuting aside our threshold contention that many of those to whom\n\n[CVRA] notification leters are intended are in fact not victims as\n\ndefined in the Atorney General’s 2ooo Victim Witness\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>—a status requiring physical, emotional or pecuniary\n\ninjury of the [victim]—it was and remains our position that these\n\nwomen may be notified of such proceedings but since they are\n\nneither witnesses nor victims to the state prosecution of this mater,\n\nthey should not be informed of fictitious “rights” or invited to make\n\nsworn writen or in-court testimonial statements against Mr. Epstein\n\nat such proceedings, as Ms. Villafafia repeatedly maintained they\n\nhad the right to do. Additionally, it was and remains our position\n\nthat any notification should be by mail and that all proactive efforts\n\nby the FBI to have communications with the witnesses after the\n\nexecution of the Agreement should finally come to an end. We\n\nagree, houever, with your December l9 modification of the\n\npreviously drafted federal notification leter and agree that the\n323 In his June 3, 2oo8 leter to Deputy Atorney General Mark Filip, Sloman wrote, “Acosta again consulted\nwith DAAG Mandelker who advised him to make the follouing proposal [to defer notification to the State Atorney’s\nOffice].” OPR found no other documentation relating to Mandelker’s purported involvement in the decision.\n\n2l9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23257", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023258.jpg": "decision as to who can be heard at a state sentencing is, amongst\nmany other issues, properly within the aegis of state decision\nmaking.*7*\n\nFollouing a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, in which Acosta asked that the\ndefense clarify its positions on the USAO proposals regarding, among other things, notifications\nto the victims, Lefkouitz responded with a December 26, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, objecting again to\nnotification of the victims. Lefkouitz argued that CVRA notification was not appropriate because\nthe Atorney General <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> defined “crime victim” as a person harmed as a result of an\noffense charged in federal district court, and Epstein had not been charged in federal court.\nNevertheless, Lefkouitz added that, despite their objection to CVRA notification, “[W]e do not\nobject (as we made clear in our leter last week) that some form of notice be given to the alleged\nvictims.” Lefkouitz requested both that the defense be given an opportunity to review any notice\nsent by the USAO, and that “any and all notices with respect to the alleged victims of state offenses\nshould be sent by the State Atorney rather than [the USAO],” and he agreed that the USAO\n“should defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding all maters with regard to those\nvictims and the state proceedings.”\n\nMonths later, in April 2oo8, Epstein’s atorneys complained in a leter to Mandelker that\nSloman and Villafafia commited professional misconduct by threatening to send a “highly\nimproper and unusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” victims.\n\nF. January — June 2oo8: While the Defense Presses Its Appeal to the Department\n\nin an Effort to Undo the NPA, the FBI and the USAO Continue Investigating\nEpstein\n\nAs described in Chapter Two of this Report, from the time the NPA was signed through\nthe end of June 2oo8, the defense employed various measures to delay, or avoid entirely,\nimplementation of the NPA. Ultimately, defense counsel’s advocacy resulted in the USAO’s\ndecision to have the federal case reviewed afresh. A review of the evidence was undertaken first\nby USAO Criminal Chief Robert Senior and then, briefly, by an experienced CEOS trial\natorney. A review of the case in light of the defense challenges was then conducted by CEOS\nChief Oosterban, in consultation with his staff and with Deputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal\nMandelker and Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher, and then by the Office of the Deputy\nAtorney General. Each review took weeks and delayed Epstein’s entry of his state guilty plea.\n\nAs set forth belou, during that time, Villafafia and the FBI continued investigating and\nworking touard potential federal charges.\n\nl. Villafafia Prepares to Contact Victims in Anticipation That Epstein\nWill Breach the NPA\n\nOn January 3, 2oo8, the local newspaper reported that Epstein’s plea conference in state\ncourt, at that point set for early January, had been rescheduled to March 2oo8, at which time he\nwould plead guilty to felony solicitation of prostitution, and that “in exchange” for the guilty plea,\n324 The 2ooo <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> were superseded by the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>.\n\n22o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23258", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023266.jpg": "camera memory cards seized by the PBPD in order to have them forensically examined for deleted\nimages that could contain child pornography.**”\n\nBy early April 2oo8, as the defense pursued its appeal to the Department’s Criminal\nDivision, Acosta predicted in an email to Villafafia and Sloman that federal charges against Epstein\nwere “more and more likely.” Villafafia asked Oosterban for help to “move this [Criminal\nDivision review] process along,” noting that the defense continued to undermine the government’s\ncase by deposing the victims “under the guise of ‘trial prep’ for the state case” and that the “agents\nand the victims” were “losing their patience.”\n\nOn April 24, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman and USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior\nasking whether she had the “green light” to file charges and raising the same concerns she had\nexpressed to Oosterban. Villafafia further cautioned that, although she was planning to file\ncharges on May 6, if that was not going to happen, “then we all need to meet with the victims, the\nagents, and the police officers to decide hou the case will be resolved and to provide them with an\nexplanation for the delay.” Because the Department’s Criminal Division did not conclude its\nreview of Epstein’s appeal by May 6, houever, Villafafia did not file charges that day.\n\nVill. USAO SUPERVISORS CONSIDER CVRA OBLIGATIONS IN AN UNRELATED\n\nMATTER AND IN LIGHT OF A NEW FIFTH CIRCUIT OPINION\n\nDuring the period after the NPA was signed, and before Epstein complied with the NPA\nby entering his state guilty pleas, the USAO supervisors were explicitly made aware of a conflict\nbetween the Department’s position that CVRA’s victims’ rights atached upon the filing of a\ncriminal charge and a new federal appellate ruling to the contrary. The contemporaneous\ncommunications confirm that in 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman were aware of the Department’s policy\nregarding the issue.\n\nUnrelated to the Epstein investigation, on April l8, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman received a\ncitizen complaint from an atorney who requested to meet with them regarding his belief that the\nFlorida Bar had violated his First Amendment rights. The atorney asserted that the CVRA\nguaranteed him “an absolute right to meet” with USAO officials because he believed that he was\nthe victim of a federal crime. Acosta forwarded the message to the USAO Appellate Division\nChief, who informed Acosta and Sloman that, according to the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, “our obligations\nunder [the CVRA] are not triggered until charges are filed.” On April 24, 2oo8, the Appellate\nDivision Chief emailed Acosta and Sloman, stating that she had “confirmed with DOJ that [her]\nreading of [the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>] is correct and that our obligations under [the CVRA] are not\ntriggered until a case is filed.”34°\n\nOn May 7, 2oo8, the Appellate Division Chief sent Acosta and Sloman a copy of a U.S.\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit opinion issued that day, /n re Dean, holding that a victim’s\nme The forensic examination did not locate useful evidence on the memory cards.\n\n343 The Appellate Division Chief advised Acosta that Acosta could inform the complainant that, prior to the\ninitiation of charges, the investigating agency was responsible for carrying out the Department’s statutory obligations\nto the victim.\n228\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23266", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023267.jpg": "CVRA rights atach prior to the filing of criminal charges.*44 The Appellate Division Chief noted\nthat, although the holding conflicted with the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, the “court’s opinion makes sense.”\n\nDean involved a federal prosecution arising from a 2oo5 explosion at an oil refinery\noperated by BP Products North America, Inc. (BP) that killed l5 people and injured more than\nl7o. Before bringing criminal charges, the government negotiated a guilty plea with BP without\nnotifying the victims. The government filed a sealed motion, alerting the district court to the\npotential plea and claiming that consultation with all the victims was impractical and that such\nnotification could result in media coverage that would undermine the plea negotiations. The court\nthen entered an order prohibiting the government from notifying the victims of the pending plea\nagreement until after it had been signed by the parties. Thereafter, the government filed a criminal\ninformation, the government and BP signed the plea agreement, and the government mailed notices\nof the plea hearing to the victims informing them of their right to be heard. One month later, l2\nvictims asked the court to reject the plea because it was entered into in violation of their rights\nunder the CVRA. The district court denied their motion, but concluded that the CVRA rights to\nconfer with the prosecutor in the case and to be treated with fairness and respect for the victim’s\ndignity and privacy vested prior to the initiation of charges.**° The district court noted that the\nlegislative history reflected a view that “the right to confer was intended to be broad,” as well as\nbeing a “mechanism[]” to ensure that victims were treated with fairness.\n\nIn denying the victims relief, the Fifth Circuit nevertheless concluded that the district court\n“failed to accord the victims the rights conferred by the CVRA.”*“° In particular, the Fifth Circuit\ncited the district court’s acknouledgement that “[t]here are clearly rights under the CVRA that\napply before any prosecution is underway.” The Fifth Circuit also noted that such consultation\nwas not “an infringement” on the government’s independent prosecutorial discretion, but “it is\nonly a requirement that the government confer in some reasonable way with the victims before\nultimately exercising its broad discretion.” In the wake of the Dean opinion, two Department\ncomponents wrote separate memoranda to the Solicitor General with opposing views concerning\nwhether the CVRA right to confer with the prosecution vests prior to the initiation of a prosecution.\nIX. JUNE 2oo8: VILLAFANA’S PRE-PLEA CONTACTS WITH THE ATTORNEY\n\nREPRESENTING THE VICTIMS WHO LATER BECAME THE CVRA\n\nPETITIONERS\n\nAccording to an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation by her atorney, Bradley Edwards,\nWild retained Edwards in June 2oo8 to represent her “because she was unable to get anyone from\nthe [USAO] to tell her what was actually going on with the federal criminal case against Jeffrey\nEpstein.”**” Villafafia told OPR that Wild did not contact her directly and she was not aware of\nSch In re Dean, 527 F.3d 39l (5th Cir. 2oo8).

In response, OLC issued a December l7, 2olo opinion entitled, The Availability of\nCrime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4. Based on the CVRA’s\nlanguage, relevant case law, and memoranda opinions from Department components, OLC\nreaffirmed its 2oo5 conclusion that CVRA rights do not vest until a criminal charge has been filed\n(by complaint, information, or indictment) and the rights cease to be available if “all charges are\ndismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or if the [g]overnment declines to bring formal\ncharges after the filing of a complaint).”°”*\n\nAfter OLC issued its opinion, the Department revised the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> in October 2oll\nbut did not change its fundamental position that the CVRA rights did not vest until after criminal\ncharges were filed. The 2oll revision did, houever, add language concerning victim consultation\nbefore a defendant is charged: “In circumstances where plea negotiations occur before a case has\nbeen brought, Department policy is that this should include reasonable consultation prior to the\nfiling of a charging instrument with the court.”*”” The use of the word “should” in the 2oll\n<span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> indicates that “personnel are expected to take the action . . . unless there is an\nappropriate, articulable reason not to do so.”*°° Nevertheless, the required consultation “may be\ngeneral in nature” and “does not have to be specific to a particular plea offer.”**! The revisions\nalso specified that AUSAs were to ensure that victims had a right to be reasonably heard at plea\nproceedings.**\n\nOn November 2, 2oll, U.S. Senator Jon Kyl, a co-sponsor of the CVRA, sent a leter to\nAtorney General Eric Holder, arguing that the 2oll <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> revisions “conflict[ed] quite\nclearly with the CVRA’s plain language” because the 2oll <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> did “not extend any rights\nto victims until charges have been filed.” The Department’s response emphasized that the\n378 OLC “express[ed] no opinion” as to whether it is a mater of “good practice” to inform victims of their CVRA\nrights prior to the filing of a complaint or after the dismissal of charges.\nae See 2oll <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, Art.

Houever, the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> generally require AUSAs to use their best efforts to comply with the\nCVRA, and the CVRA specifically affords victims the right to be heard at plea proceedings.

The CVRA Litigation Proceedings and Current Status\n\nWhile the CVRA litigation was pending in the Southern District of Florida, numerous\nfederal civil suits against Epstein, brought in the same district, were transferred to the same judge\nas “related cases,” as a mater of judicial economy pursuant to the Local Rules. As the parties\nagreed on setlements in those civil cases, they were dismissed.*** Several of the victims who had\nsetled their civil cases filed a pleading in the CVRA litigation asking the court to “maintain their\nanonymity” and not “further disseminate[]” their identities to the CVRA petitioners.**°\n\nIn the CVRA case, the petitioners claimed that the government violated their CVRA rights\nto confer by (l) negotiating and signing the NPA without victim input; (2) sending leters to the\nvictims claiming that the mater was “under investigation” after the NPA was already signed; and\n(3) not properly informing the victims that the state plea would also resolve the federal\ninvestigation. In addition, the petitioners alleged that the government violated their CVRA right\nto be treated with fairness by concealing the NPA negotiation and also violated their CVRA right\nto reasonable notice by concealing that the state court proceeding impacted the enforcement of the\nNPA and resolved the federal investigation.\n\nDuring the litigation, the USAO argued that (l) the victims had no right to notice or\nconferral about the NPA because the CVRA rights did not apply pre-charge; (2) the government’s\n383 l57 Cong. Rec. $7359-o2 (2oll) (Kyl leter and Department response).\n\n384 Epstein also resolved some county court civil cases during this time period as well. In addition, numerous\nother cases were resolved outside of formal litigation. For example, one atorney told OPR that he resolved l6 victim\ncases, but did not file all cases with the court. Court data indicate that the atorney filed only 3 of the l6 cases he said\nhe resolved.\n\n385 Doe, Response to Court Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance at l (July 24,\n2ol5).\n\n242\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2328o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023281.jpg": "leters to victims sent after the NPA was signed were not misleading in stating that the mater was\n“under investigation” because the government continued to investigate given its uncertainty that\nEpstein would plead guilty; and (3) Villafafia contacted the petitioners’ atorney prior to Epstein’s\nstate plea to advise him of the hearing. Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR that, while there were\nvalid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is\na case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required. I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [Vvictim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key conclusion that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for resolution after development of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\nintention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\nconcluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”?°°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, “[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]uidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2328l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023282.jpg": "the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> was inconsistent with positions the USAO had taken in correspondence with\nEpstein’s atorneys, in which the government acknouledged that “it had obligations to notify the\nvictims.” The court ordered the parties to submit additional briefs regarding the appropriate\nremedies. Accordingly, the petitioners requested multiple specific remedies, including rescission\nof the NPA; a writen apology to all victims from the government; a meeting with Acosta,\nVillafafia, and her supervisors; access to government records, including grand jury materials;\ntraining for USAO employees; and monetary sanctions and atorneys’ fees.*°”\n\nFollouing Epstein’s indictment on federal charges in New York and subsequent death\nwhile in custody, on September l6, 2ol9, the district judge presiding over the CVRA case denied\nthe petitioners’ motion for remedies and closed the case, stating that Epstein’s death “rendered the\nmost significant issue that was pending before the Court, namely, whether the Government’s\nviolation of Petitioners’ rights under the CVRA invalidated the NPA, moot.”**8 The court did not\norder the government to take corrective measures, but stated that it “fully expects the Government\nwill honor its representation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the\nproper treatment of crime victims.”**? The court also denied the petitioners’ request for atorneys’\nfees, finding that the government did not act in bad faith, because, “[a]lthough unsuccessful on the\nmerits of the issue of whether there was a violation of the CVRA, the Government asserted\nlegitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation.”\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, Wild appealed the district court’s rejection of the requested\nremedies, through a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit.*”° In its responsive brief, the government expressed sympathy for Wild and\n“regret[] [for] the manner in which it communicated with her in the past.”*?! Nevertheless, the\ngovernment argued that, “‘as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in SDFL because\nno criminal charges were brought.”*°? The government conceded, houever, that with regard to\nthe New York prosecution in which Epstein had been indicted, “[p]etitioner and other Epstein\n387 Doe, Jane Doe l and Jane Doe 2’s Submission on Proposed Remedies (May 23, 2ol9).\n\n388 Doe, Opinion and Order (Sept. l6, 2ol9). Among other things, the court rejected the petitioners’ contention\nthat it did not address whether the government had violated the victims’ CVRA right to be treated with fairness and\nto receive fair notice of the proceedings, noting that “[t]hese rights all flou from the right to confer and were\nencompassed in the Court’s ruling finding a violation of the CVRA.”\n389 The Department’s Office of Legal Programs provided a training entitled Crime Victims’ Rights in the Federal\nSystem to the USAO on January lo, 2o2o.\n32o See In re Wild, No. l9-l3843, Petition for a Writ of Mandamus Pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act,\nl8 U.S.C. § 377l(d)(3) (Sept. 3o, 2ol9).\n32l Wild, Brief of the United States of America in Response to Petition for Writ of Mandamus Under the Crime\nVictims Rights Act at l4 (Oct. 3l, 2ol9).

In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”*”°\n\nA, At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—ls “‘always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.””*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges.

The “prosecution stage”\nbegan when charges were filed and continued through all post-sentencing legal proceedings.*””\n\nAt the time the parties signed the NPA in September 2oo7, few courts had addressed victim\nstanding under the CVRA. Notably, district courts in New York and South Carolina had ruled that\nstanding atached only upon the filing of federal charges.*°’ Two cases relied upon by the court\nin its February 2ol9 opinion—Dean and its underlying district court opinion, BP Products—were\ndecided after the NPA was signed.\n\nThe CVRA litigation and proposed federal legislation—both pending as of the date of this\nReport—shou that the interpretation of victim standing under the CVRA continues to be a mater\nof debate.*! In a November 2l, 2ol9 leter to Atorney General William Barr, a Congressional\nRepresentative stated that she had recently introduced legislation specifically to “[c]larify that\nvictims of federal crimes have the right to confer with the Government and be informed about key\npre-charging developments in a case, such as . . . non-prosecution agreements.”*°? The CVRA\nlitigation arising from the Epstein case shous the lack of clarity regarding when CVRA rights\napply: the district court concluded that CVRA rights applied pre-charge, but a sharply divided\npanel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals came to a contrary conclusion, a decision that has\nnou been vacated while the entire court hears the case en banc.\n\nBecause the Supreme Court had not addressed the issue of when CVRA rights apply, the\nlouer courts had reached divergent conclusions, and the Department had concluded that CVRA\nrights did not apply pre-charge, OPR concludes that the subjects’ failure to consult with victims\nbefore signing the NPA did not constitute professional misconduct because at that time, the CVRA\ndid not clearly and unambiguously require prosecutors to consult with victims before the filing of\nfederal criminal charges.*\n\n398 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, Art.

As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by administrative complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official\nto “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”’—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\nidentified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the\nvictims with appropriate notification.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no recollection of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the right, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23296", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023299.jpg": "require victim approval of the prosecutors’ plans, but it allous victims the opportunity to express\ntheir views and to be heard before a final decision is made.

LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\n\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\nresolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*?\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim Specialist. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\n4o8 Villafafia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\n<span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, Art. IV, § B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners.

The USAO Was Not Responsible for Victim Notification Leters Sent by the\n\nFBI in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and May 2oo8 Describing the Status of\nthe Case as “Under Investigation”\n\nThe 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> charged the FBI with informing the victims of CVRA rights and\navailable services during the “investigative stage” of a case. During the Epstein investigation, the\nFBI case agents complied with the agency’s notification obligation by hand delivering pamphlets\nto victims follouing their interviews and through computer-generated leters sent to the victims by\nthe FBI’s Victim Specialist. The FBI’s notification process is independent of the USAO’s. The\nUSAO has its oun Victim Witness Specialist who assumes the responsibility for victim\nnotification after an indictment or complaint moved the case into the “prosecution stage.”\n\nThe FBI’s Victim Specialist used the VNS to prepare the October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8 leters, a system the FBI regularly employs to comply with its obligations under the\n2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> to inform the victims of their rights and other services during the “investigative\nstage.” The stock language of that leter, houever, was generic and failed to communicate the\nunique case-specific status of the Epstein investigation at that time. The FBI Victim Specialist\nwho sent the leters acted at the case agent’s direction and was not aware of the existence of the\nNPA at the time she created the leters.4!° Neither FBI case agent reviewed any of the leters sent\nby the FBI’s Victim Specialist.*!! According to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the leters and\nthe wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Although the FBI case agents\ninformed Villafafia after the fact that the FBI’s Victim Specialist sent her “standard form leter,”\nVillafafia had never reviewed an FBI-generated victim notification leter and was not aware of its\ncontents.*!? Villafafia told OPR she was unaware of the content of the FBI leters until they were\ncollected for the CVRA litigation, sometime after July 2oo8.\n\n4lo The case agent told OPR that she did not recall specifically directing the Victim Specialist to send a leter,\nbut acknouledged that “she would come to us before she would approach a victim.”\n\nal The case agent told OPR that she had no role in drafting the leters and believed them to be “standard form\nleters.” Similarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “I can’t think that I’ve ever reviewed any of them . . . they just go\nfrom the victim coordinator.”\n\nal2 Villafafia’s lack of familiarity with the language in the FBI leters led to some inconsistency in the\ninformation provided to victims concerning their CVRA rights. Beginning in 2oo6, the FBI provided to victims\nstandard leters advising victims of their CVRA rights but which also noted that only some of the rights applied\npre-charge. During this period, Villafafia also crafted her oun introductory leters to the victims to let them knou of\ntheir CVRA rights and that the federal investigation “would be a different process” from the prior state investigation\nin which “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated by the State Atorney’s Office.” Villafafia told\nOPR that in a case in which she “need[ed] to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia’s leter itemized the CVRA\nrights, but it did not explain that those rights atached only after a formal charge had been made. The leter was hand\n\n262\nDOJ-OGR-ooo233oo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023317.jpg": "and they often cannot fully reveal either the facts or the status of an investigation, even with\nvictims. The 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> advise that in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited\nin their disclosures: “Because victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government,\nand may disclose whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only nonsensitive data and\npublic information.”*°\n\nVillafafia’s concern about generating potential impeachment evidence by informing\nvictims of their potential to recover monetary damages from Epstein was not unreasonable.\nIndeed, the case agents initially raised the impeachment issue, and after considering the problem,\nVillafafia agreed with the agents’ concerns. Villafafia raised those concerns with the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer in October 2oo7 after the agents brought the issue to her\natention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom\nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound. OPR also considered that although\nVillafafia had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her\nsupervisor, the U.S. Atorney, had decided otherwise. When authorized to inform Edwards of the\nscheduled change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global resolution that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) atendance at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the resolution of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).“44 Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential conclusion of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\n48 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, Art. lV, J B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim notification leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\n\n“44 The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\nresolution of a sex abuse case. Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR-ooo233l7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023318.jpg": "intentionally concealing information from them and was part of a series of interactions with\nvictims that led to condemnation of the government’s treatment of victims. **°\nVI. THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO TREAT VICTIMS FORTHRIGHTLY AND\n\nWITH SENSITIVITY WHEN IT FAILED TO TIMELY PROVIDE VICTIMS\n\nWITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESOLUTION OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAlthough OPR does not conclude that any of the subjects commited professional\nmisconduct, either by failing to consult with the victims before the NPA was signed or in\ninteractions afterwards, OPR’s findings are not an endorsement of the government’s course of\naction. The government’s interactions with victims confused and frustrated many of the victims,\nparticularly the two CVRA petitioners and the two victims who had unsuccessfully atempted to\njoin in the CVRA litigation. As a result, the victims’ and the public’s perception of the mater is\nthat the prosecutors worked with Epstein’s atorneys to disenfranchise and silence the victims. It\nis unfortunate, and appears fundamentally unfair to the victims, that Acosta and Sloman (after\nMenchel and Lourie departed) took the unusual step of deciding to vet the USAO victim\nnotification leters with the defense after the NPA was signed, but failed to go beyond the\nrequirements of the CVRA or the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span> to consult with the victims before the NPA was\nsigned. This result is contrary to the Department’s intent, as set forth in the 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>, that\nDepartment employees work to “minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of crime\nendure in its wake.” When considering the entirety of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by\nthe Department.\n\nWild’s criticisms of the government’s conduct were based on interactions that are similar\nto and generally representative of the government’s interactions with other Epstein victims and\nthat demonstrate an overall lack of sensitivity to the victims by the government. Wild experienced\na series of confusing and inconsistent communications in her interactions with Villafafia and the\ncase agents. Wild received Villafafia’s leter in June 2oo7 stating inaccurately that she was a\nfederal victim entitled to CVRA rights. She was interviewed by the FBI in August 2oo7 but was\nnot told that a potential outcome was a state plea. Shortly after the September 24, 2oo7 signing of\nthe NPA, the FBI contacted her to inform her of the resolution of the federal case. Nonetheless,\non January lo, 2oo8, the FBI sent her a victims’ rights leter indicating that the case was under\ninvestigation and that some of her CVRA rights may not apply until after the defendant was\ncharged. On January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia re-interviewed Wild, along with a CEOS atorney and\nthe FBI agents, and told Wild that the case was under investigation, but did not specifically mention\nthe NPA, although she may have mentioned a possible resolution. In mid-June 2oo8, when\nEdwards contacted Villafafia on Wild’s behalf, Villafafia informed him that the case was under\ninvestigation but did not mention the NPA. Just before Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8 state court plea,\n“45 OPR notes that, similar to Villafafia, Sloman interacted with a victim’s atorney during the time period\nbetween the signing of the NPA and Epstein’s state guilty plea. In January 2oo8, Sloman received a telephone call\nfrom his former law partner, who represented one of the victims and who asked Sloman whether the federal\ngovernment could bring charges against Epstein. Sloman, concerned about the potential for conflict of interest\nallegations due to his prior business relations with the atorney, refused to answer any questions regarding Epstein.\nBecause Sloman refused to provide any information, OPR found no basis for finding that Sloman misled the atorney.\n\n28o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023320.jpg": "to be paid to the FBI’s communications to ensure that the victims were receiving accurate and\ntimely information that was consistent with the status of the case and with the USAO’s\ncommunications with victims.*4”\n\nThe decision not to inform victims and their atorneys about the existence of the NPA gave\nvictims and the public the misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel\nto keep the agreement secret from the victims. Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“48 For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities. In certain cases, such as the\nEpstein case, prosecutors may need to provide more oversight when multiple Department\ncomponents are communicating with victims to avoid providing confusing and contradictory\nmessages.\nindependent of the NPA provision. OPR also notes that impeachment regarding the NPA provision may have\npermited the government to rehabilitate the victims through their prior statements to law enforcement. In other words,\nwhile the USAO’s view concerning potential impeachment was not unreasonable, more extensive consideration of the\ncase agent’s concerns might have led the prosecutors to conclude that the risk of the information being used to\nsignificantly damage the credibility of the victims was lou.\nca In addition to the FBI leters previously discussed, another example of the inconsistent communication can\nbe seen in leters that were to be sent after Epstein entered his guilty plea to two victims residing in foreign countries.\nAlthough OPR was unable to confirm that the two victims actually received the leters, it appears from the records\nOPR reviewed that the government intended to provide them with a standard FBI leter stating that the case was under\ninvestigation while also providing them with a USAO leter stating that the case had been resolved through Epstein’s\nstate guilty plea.\n\n“48 OPR understands that the Department is in the process of revising the 2oll <span class=\"highlight\">Guidelines</span>.\n282\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2332o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023750.jpg": "Approved legal representatives (law clerk, paralegal,\ninterpreter, investigator, psychologist, and other experts} may\naccompany an atorney into the Visiting Room.

The procedures outlined belou\nhave been in effect since the aforementioned date. This memorandum is being resubmited as revisions\nhave been made since this period of time and updated signatures are necessary.\nl. PURPOSE: To establish procedures at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC),\nNew York with regard to inmates placed on Psychological Observation status.\n2) DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a\nmental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental\nstatus), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate\nis no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general\npopulation or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological\nobservation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal\n(e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to\nhis/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping,\ndisorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable.\nPsychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until\nsuch time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in\ngeneral population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an\ninpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.\n3. PROCEDURES: The follouing are the <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> for a Psychological Observation:\nA. Only a member from the Psychology Services Department may place and remove an\ninmate from Psychological Observation status as only a psychologist can determine if an\ninmate is at elevated risk for suicide or not. Upon placement or removal of Psychological |\nObservation, the Psychologist will notify the Operations Lieutenant, Health Services Staff\n(i.e., Physician Assistants, Health Services Administrator, and Clinical Director), Food\nService Administrator, and Duty Officer.\nB. Psychological Observations will be conducted in the suicide watch area or when not\nfeasible due to space limitations, one of the designated suicide watch cells in SHU.

Many of\n7 the girls came from disadvantaged backgrounds or broken homes, and they were susceptible to Epsiein’s cash,\n| intimidation, and charm. Those who were l6 when they went to El Brillo Way would have been in their 2os by the time\n| they took the stand, and Epstein’s investigators had dredged up every instance of bad behavior in their pasts.\nAccording te an exchange in the Reiter deposition, a few of the victims had worked in West Palm Beach at massage\nparlors knoun as “jack shacks.” Each new compromising detail was immediately forwarded to the State Atorney's\nOffice, where staff met frequently with Epstein's lawyers.\nThe Florida statutes are clear: Any person older than 24 who engages in sexual contact with someone under the age\n7 of l8 commits @ felony of the second degree. The victim's prior sexual conduct is not relevant; ignorance of her age is\nno defense. She needn't resist physically to cast doubt on the issue of “consent.” For a child under l6, even lewd\nbehavior short of touching is a felony of the second degree. But convincing a jury that a sexual encounter is a heinous\ncrime is difficult if the victim can be made to appear willing and unharmed, not to mention vulgar and mercenary. It\nwasn't hard to imagine some of the victims quickly being discredited in court by Epstein’s crack legal team, who\nrepeatedly noted that the age of consent is louer in many other states.\nBut that dcesn’t quite explain why the Department of Justice would forge the child-trafficking charges, which pertain\nregardless of a girl's atitude or character. Epstein’s final sentence is so out of line with the statufory <span class=\"highlight\">guidelines</span> for that\ncrime that it appears the department may have been influenced by the existence of his many pouerful friends and\natorneys. A highly intelligent man whe once taught math at the Dalton School in New York without a bachelors\ndegree, Epstein has been a serious and respected player in the highest reaches of politics and philantirapy. He has\nmade substantial contributions to political candidates, served on the Council on Foreign Relations, and donated $3o\nmillion to Harvard University.\nMoreover, many of his high-pouered acquaintances availed themselves of Epstein’s private jets, for which the pilot\nlogs, obtained by discovery in the civil suits, sometimes shoued that bold-face names were on the same flights as\nunderage girls. A high-profile trial threatened to splash mud over all sorts of big players, just as both Gov. Richardson\nand Bill Clinton’s wife were running for president. Also, a hedge fund prosecution in which Epstein offered ta give\nevidence was heating up. Alberio Gonzales, who was U.S. atorney general throughout most of the Epstein\ninvestigation and resigned just before the non-prosecution agreement was signed, told The Daily Beast that he “would\nhave instructed the Justice Department to pursue justice without making a political mess.” But that may have been an\nimpossible mandate, given the players involved.\nInstead, said atorney Brad Edwards, “Epstein commited crimes that should have jailed him for most of his life...he\nwas jailed for only a few months.” And this week he walks through his door a free man.\nConchita Samoff has developed multimedia communication programs for Fortune 5oo companies and has produced\nfhree current events debate television programs, The Americas Forum, From Beirut fo Kabul, and a segment for The\nOppenheimer Report.
