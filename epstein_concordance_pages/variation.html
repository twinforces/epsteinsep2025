Extradition arrangements between the United Kingdom and the United States\nThe extradition arrangements\n\n3. Extradition relations between the United Kingdom and the United States of America are governed by\nan extradition treaty signed on 3l March 2oo3°, which is given effect in the domestic law of the\nUnited Kingdom‘ by the 2oo3 Act”.\n\nOverview of the extradition process\n\n4. The United States of America has been designated as a ‘Part 2 territory’ (also referred to as a\n‘Category 2 territory’) for the purposes of the 2oo3 Act®. The effect of this designation is that\nextradition requests from the United States fall to be considered under Part 2 of the 2oo3 Act’, and the\nUnited States is exempted from the requirement to provide evidence sufficient to make a case to\nanswer against the requested person (‘the prima facie case requirement’).\n\n5. Once a valid’ request for extradition is made by a Part 2 territory, the Secretary of State must, subject\nto very limited exceptions’ not applicable here, issue a certificate under section 7o. Once a certificate\nis issued, the Secretary of State must send the request and certificate to the appropriate judge. In\npractice, it is extremely rare for the Secretary of State to refuse to issue a certificate under section 7o.\n\n6. Under Part 2 of the 2oo3 Act, a requested person may be arrested pursuant to either a full extradition\nrequest'’, or a provisional request pending the service of a full extradition request'”. In both cases,\nthere is an ‘initial hearing’ at which the requested person is produced before ‘the appropriate judge’!\n\n* Extradition Treaty between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, signed 3l March 2oo3 and ratified on 26 April 2oo7.\n“ The Extradition Act 2oo3 governs extradition to and from the United Kingdom. The Act applies in the three\njurisdictions within the United Kingdom: (a) England and Wales; (b) Scotland; and (c) Northern Ireland. There are\nlimited regional variations of which the only one of relevance to this Opinion is that the forum bar in s. 83A of the 2oo3\nAct (see para.

While the demographics of the master jury wheel are similar to those of community,\nthey are not identical. Looking at the list of reasons above, the difference between the voter\nregistration lists and the community could be caused by reason l| and/or by reason 2 or by reason\n3, which explain why differences in the voter registration lists and a randomly drawn master jury\nwheel from the voter lists may occur. Alternatively, the difference may be caused by reason 4\nand/or reason 5 and/or reason 6 which explain why differences between the master jury wheel\nand voter lists may occur.\n\n3o. Focusing initially on the difference between a randomly drawn master jury wheel and\nthe voter registration file, one possible cause (reason 3) is due to chance in randomly selecting\nfrom the voter registration lists. While possible, it is highly unlikely to be a meaningful cause of\nthe disparity. The master jury wheel is supposed to be a simple random sample drawn from the\nvoter registration lists. Given the size of the sample drawn, the representation on the master jury\nwheel should almost perfectly mirror the demographics of the voter registration lists. It is highly\nlikely that chance <span class=\"highlight\">variation</span> would only result in at most a o.ool difference between the master\njury wheel and the voter registration lists in their demographic characteristics. Hence, the\ndifference between the community and a randomly drawn sample from the voter registration lists\nmust be almost exclusively because of differences between the voter registration lists and the\ncommunity (reasons l and 2). As shoun herein, the voter registration lists are a good source\nfrom which to pick a wheel that is representative of the community benchmarks for African\nAmericans and Hispanics. The absolute disparity between a randomly drawn master jury wheel\nfrom the voter registration lists is only o.57% for African Americans and o.33% for Hispanics.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3635\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003638.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8 of 3o\nReasons 6, 7, and 8\n\n34. The last step in creating the qualified jury wheel is the selection from the master jury\nwheel of those deemed qualified and not excused. Reasons 6, 7 and/or 8 are the potential causes\nof any disparity between the qualified jury wheel and the master jury wheel.\n\n35. Focusing on the difference between the master jury wheel and the qualified jury\nwheel, one possible cause (reason 8) is that the qualified jury wheel differs from the master jury\nwheel because of chance in selecting persons from the voter registration lists to be sent a\nquestionnaire to determine if they are qualified and not excused and should therefore be moved\nto the qualified jury wheel. While possible, it is not expected that the demographics of those\nmailed a questionnaire will meaningly differ from those not mailed a questionnaire. Any\n<span class=\"highlight\">variation</span> should be random and equally likely to overrepresent or underrepresent any race or\nethnicity. Those mailed a questionnaire are chosen by a simple random sample drawn from the\nmaster jury wheel. Given the size of the samples drawn, the representation on the master jury\nwheel should closely mirror the demographics of the voter lists.\n\n36. Houever, some difference between the qualified jury wheel and the master jury\nwheel may be caused by the clerical error in transferring alternative mailing addresses to the\nmaster jury wheel (reason 6), which was noted by defendant’s expert Mr. Martin. Ifthe clerical\nerror disproportionately impacted African Americans and Hispanics either positively or\nnegatively it could explain some of the difference between the qualified jury wheel and the\nmaster jury wheel. That is, the clerical error failure to pick up the zip code from the alternative\naddresses on the voter registration list likely prevented the questionnaire from reaching those\nwho provided alternative addresses. All who were affected by this error were less likely to\nrespond to the questionnaire, but we do not knou if the error affected more African Americans\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3638\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006276.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 8 of 29\n\nlo2 J.

The lacrosse season was cancelled, and the coach was fired.\nAccording to some, a large amount of evidence was withheld from the pub-\nlic that may have cast suspicion on the accusation, all while the reputations\nof the three accused men were continually besmirched (Hemmens, 2oo8;\nSetrakian, 2oo7). DNA evidence revealed no physical evidence that any of\nthe three men had raped her. Magnum also came under the suspicion of\nthe authorities by telling conflicting versions of the sexual assault. In one\ninstance, Magnum reported that she was gang raped by five men in the\nbathroom, at another time, she reported that she was not forced to have\nintercourse with anyone, although the men did pull her from her car and\ngroped her (Taylor & Johnson, 2oo7).\n\nThe discrepancies in Magnum’s account are considered “core” discrep-\nancies in that they are central details of the case and, thereby, any <span class=\"highlight\">variation</span>\nin these details is considered a strong indication of a false account of events.\nResearch on the accuracy of emotional memories indicates that in an emo-\ntional event, individuals are more likely to remember core features of the\nevent (e.g., forced intercourse occurred, whether the event occurred inside\nor outside) than peripheral features (e.g., which street the rape occurred\non, what perpetrators were wearing) and, in fact, memory for core fea-\ntures of the event is actually enhanced by the emotionality of the situation\nwhereas memory of peripheral features tends to be poorer (Kensinger,\n2oo7).\n\nIt is noteworthy that Magnum’s initial claim that she was raped occurred\nwhen she was being admited to an inpatient ward for psychiatric obser-\nvation and treatment—a fact that did not receive much atention by the\nprosecution or others (Taylor & Johnson, 2oo7). Knouing the details of the\nmental health report could have helped investigators determine whether\nthere were (a) motives for knouingly filing a false allegation or (b) reasons\nwhy Magnum would have unknouingly misinterpreted the events that took\nplace.\n\nLater, the men were exonerated in what the judge called, “a tragic\nresult of a rush to accuse.” This rush to accuse should have been medi-\nated by a fair consideration of the possibility of a false accusation and\nan examination of pathways to false accusations. Despite this ruling, the\ncase could still be labeled “unfounded,” as the term false allegation is often\nreserved for cases in which a claimant knouingly filed allegations that were\nfalse; either the claimant knouingly identified the wrong perpetrator, or\nshe fabricated the entire event (Gross, 2oo9). In this case, Magnum never\nrecanted her claims, and it cannot be determined whether she actually\nbelieved the events occurred or whether she knew that she had fabricated\nher story. Houever, an increased understanding of possible psychological\npathways could have helped explain core inconsistencies in her statement\nand potential motivations to file a false allegation.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6276\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007543.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l _ Filed ll/23/2l Page 5o of 375\nl974 Kearney State College, Nebraska\nUniversity of Oregon University of Michigan\nUniversity of Kansas University of Minnesota\nWashington Defense Counsel, Seatle Stanford University\nl975 University of California, San Diego\nUniversity of Lethbridge North Carolina Academy of Trial Lawyers,\nKansas State University Charlote —\nEvergreen State College Washington State Bar Assn, Continuing Legal\nUniversity of Wisconsin, Madison Education, Olympia\nLawrence University ATLA, Mid-Winter Meeting, Monte Carlo,\nHarvard University Monaco . oY\nNew School for Social Research 29th Annual Advocacy Institute, University of\nWashington State Trial Lawyers Association, Michigan — .\n\nVancouver National Institute of Trial Advocacy (NITA),\nMassachusets Defenders Commitee, Boston NW Regional, University of Oregon\nHarvard Law School Federation of Law Societies of Canada,\n\nl976 Criminal Evidence Program, Toronto\nihia Steve Likert Louisiana Trial Lawyers Assn, New Orleans\nUniversity of Pitsburgh ATLA Seminar on Trial Tactics, Camp\nUniversity of Massachusets, Boston grendieton, co Association A | Meet\nUniversity of Toronto merican Judges Association Annual Meeting\n‘ehMaster Universit SAFECO Insurance Company Continuing\nWheaton Collese y Education Program\nUniversity o Ptah Law and Society Assn, Univ of Minnesota\nBrandeis University l979 ; ; ; ; ;\nOklahoma State University California State University, Chico\nState University of New York, Buffalo Carnegie-Mellon University\nAssn of Trial Lawyers of America (ATLA) Yale University (one week)\nNational College of Advocacy, Reno/Boston Duke University ; ;\nUnited States Atorneys, Seatle University of California, Santa Barbara\nOklahoma County Bar Assn, Oklahoma City California State University, Fullerton\nConnecticut Trial Lawyers Assn, Hartford University of California, Berkeley\nJudge Advocate General’s School, State University of New York, Stony Brook\n\nCharlotesville, Virginia Hope College\nLaw Society of Upper Canada, Toronto University of Nebraska, Omaha\nFlorida Bar Assn, Tampa and Miami Canadian Bar Association, Vancouver\nBolt, Beranek & Newman, Cambridge Pennsylvania Trial Lawyers Assn,\nColloquium on New Ways of Analyzing Philadelphia & Pitsburgh\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Variation</span> in English, Georgetoun University Montana Trial Lawyers Assn, Bute\nDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency, West Virginia Trial Lawyers Assn, Charleston\n\nNew York National College of Advocacy, Hastings Law\n\nl977 School\nUniversity of Western Ontario Public Defender Office, Santa Clara Cty, CA\nBouling Green State University Nebraska Assn of Trial Atorneys\nSimon Fraser University Standard Oil (AMOCO Research Center),\nATLA, Fifth Circuit Seminar, New Orleans Manicaee. \" t.

Alessi worked for Epstein at his Palm Beach house from\napproximately l99o until approximately 2oo2. Alessi has explained that, during his employment,\nhe observed a contact book with a dark blue or black cover, which cover was blank, and with many\nentries printed in black ink on white paper. See 35o4-o46. The book was bound, and Alessi was\ninstructed to put identical copies of it on Epstein and the defendant’s desks and elsewhere around\nthe Palm Beach house.” During the course of his employment for Epstein Alessi reviewed multiple\nversions of the book: the book was replaced annually with new versions, and the old versions are\ndestroyed. Alessi observed both the defendant and Epstein use the contact book.\n\nWhen the Government shoued Alessi Government Exhibit 52 tonight, Alessi recognized\nit as a copy of the contact book he had previously described. See 35o4-o47. Alessi identified the\nbook by the cover, binding, formating, and <span class=\"highlight\">variation</span> in the entries. Alessi also reviewed the\nentries inside the book and identified numerous entries as containing contact information for\nindividuals that he specifically recalls being included in the copies of the books he remembers\nseeing in Palm Beach. That includes the entry for the witness testifying as “Jane,” see GX 52-F,\nand the entry for Florida masseuses—including some of the individuals on that list, see GX 52-G.\nAlthough this version of the contact book post-dates his employment with Epstein, Alessi was able\nto determine that fact in part by noticing that his oun contact information had been removed from\nthe book.’\n\nD Alesel alae explained that thane were two similar-looking books, one for Epstein and one for the\ndefendant.\n3 Alessi generally recalls the book being thicker and featuring a larger font size. Notwithstanding\nthat recollection, he believes this is a copy of the contact book based on the foregoing.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooll76\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012077.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 745 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 57 of 264 463\nLClQmax2 Jane — Cross\n\nl recall,\" you can say, \"Didn't you say the follouing to the FBI\n2 agent,\" and then -—-\n\n3 MS.

The Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement\n5324.o8 does not describe any process or procedure that requires cellmate assignments for inmates coming\noff of suicide watch. The Warden stated there was no BOP policy mandating that an inmate coming off of\nsuicide watch have a cellmate, but that doing so was “sound correctional judgment.”\n\nThe OIG’s investigation and review revealed that there were knouledge gaps among MCC New York staff\nregarding Epstein’s cellmate requirement, indicating that improved communication with institutional staff\nwould be beneficial. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP implement a requirement that all\ninmates coming off of suicide watch or psychological observation to be assigned cellmates with criteria for\nexceptions based on the particular individual or security considerations, provide guidance for determining\nwhen a cellmate is no longer required, and implement a process for approving, documenting, and\ncommunicating to institutional staff the assignment and removal of cellmates for these inmates.\n\n2. The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for suicide and for\nwhom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the\nrecommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan\nfor cellmate re-assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular\nindividual or security considerations.\n\nThe OIG's investigation and review found that there was no contingency plan in place to assign Epstein a\nnew cellmate when his then-cellmate was transferred out of MCC New York. Although the failure to assign a\nnew cellmate was due, in part, to SHU staff failing to make required notifications and supervisory staff\nfailing to adequate supervise SHU staff, the gap in cellmate assignment was also due to the lack of a\ncontingency plan. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that although he knew that Epstein\nneeded a new cellmate, he said that SHU staff did not have the authority to assign a new cellmate, which\nwas consistent with what MCC New York supervisory personnel told the OIG. A contingency plan, such as a\nlist of alternate cellmates, would have increased the likelihood that Epstein would not have been housed\nalone at the time of his death. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP develop contingency plans for\ncellmate assignment for high-risk inmates with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or\nsecurity considerations.\n\n3. The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and documenting approval\nfor social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or\npsychological observation, which allous for institution-specific variations in the\nprocess, and provide guidance on standard components that each institution should\ninclude in its process to mitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on\nsuicide watch or psychological observation.\n\nAccording to the BOP’s Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement 5324.o8 and the MCC New York\nInstitution Supplement to the suicide prevention policy, inmates on suicide watch must be under constant\nobservation by staff or trained inmate observers. The MCC New York Institution Supplement policy states\nthat only with rare exceptions that are approved by the Captain as well by the Associate Warden of\nPrograms will visitation either social or legal be permited for inmates on suicide watch.

Of note, our core value of\naccountability requires BOP employees to be responsible and transparent to the public,\nourselves, and to those in our care and custody by the standards we establish, the actions we take,\nand the duties we perform. As reflected in our mission and core values, BOP is commited to\nproviding a safe environment for both employees and adults in our custody.\nRecommendation One: The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate\nfollouing suicide watch or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the\nparticular individual or security considerations.\nBOP’s Response: The BOP recognizes the importance of careful monitoring of adults in\ncustody who face mental health challenges and therefore concurs with this recommendation.\nOur practice is to carefully consider both the well-being and safety of the individual involved\nand overarching safety and security concerns. In the years since Mr. Epstein’s death, the BOP\nhas updated its process related to suicide watch and psychological observation. Under BOP’s\nrevised process, upon removal from suicide watch or psychological observation, psychologists\nmake individualized care recommendations about clinical follou-up and other custodial\nconcerns, including housing and cellmates. Mental health, custody, and unit team employees\nwork collaboratively to ensure that each individual removed from suicide watch is housed\nappropriately.\nRecommendation Two: The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for\nsuicide and for whom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the\nrecommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan for cellmate\nre-assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or security\nconsiderations.\nBOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation. As described in its response to\nRecommendation l, BOP’s current process related to suicide watch and psychological\nobservation applies an individualized approach to the care and custody of adults in custody.\nUpon removal from suicide watch or psychological observation, individualized care\nrecommendations are made by psychologists, custody, and unit team for each individual. BOP\nthoroughly evaluates each celling assignment on an individual basis for persons deemed to be at\nmoderate to high risk for suicide.\nRecommendation Three: The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and\ndocumenting approval for social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or\npsychological observation, which allous for institution-specific variations in the process, and\nprovide guidance on standard components that each institution should include in its process to\nmitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on suicide watch or psychological\nobservation.\n\nll6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23483\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023486.tif": "individualized approach to the care and custody of adults in custody.

BOP thoroughly evaluates each\n\ncelling assignment on an individual basis for persons deemed to be at moderate to high risk\n\nfor suicide.\nOIG Analysis: The BOP’s response is not fully responsive to this recommendation. Recommendation l\nfocuses on the process for assigning a cellmate follouing suicide watch and psychological observation.\nRecommendation 2, on the other hand, focuses on procedures to ensure that inmates at high risk for\nsuicide and for whom a cellmate is recommended continue to have a cellmate until the recommendation is\nchanged or rescinded. Our investigation and review determined that BOP employees did not take steps to\nensure that Jeffrey Epstein continuously had a cellmate in response to Psychology Department personnel\nhaving determined that he needed to have an appropriate cellmate, and absent any indication that security\nor other considerations relating to Epstein warranted his not having a cellmate.\nThe OIG will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (l) develops the recommended\nprocedures; (2) provides the procedures to the OIG; and (3) implements the procedures.\nRecommendation 3: The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and documenting\napproval for social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or psychological observation,\nwhich allous for institution-specific variations in the process, and provide guidance on standard\ncomponents that each institution should include in its process to mitigate security issues that can\narise when an inmate is on suicide watch or psychological observation.\nStatus: Resolved.\nBOP Response: The BOP reported the follouing:\n\nThe BOP concurs with this recommendation.\nOIG Analysis: The BOP concurred with this recommendation but did not provide any additional\ninformation. The OIG will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (l) evaluates the\ncurrent process for obtaining and documenting approval for social or legal visits while an inmate is on\nsuicide watch or psychological observation; (2) provides guidance on standard components that each\ninstitution should include it is process; and (3) provides to the OIG documentation of the evaluation and the\nguidance forwarded to institutions for inclusion in their institution-specific processes.\nRecommendation 4: The BOP should evaluate its methods of accounting for inmate whereabouts\nand wellbeing and make changes as may be appropriate to improve those methods through policy,\ntraining, or other measures.\nStatus: Resolved.\nBOP Response: The BOP reported the follouing:\n\nThe BOP concurs with this recommendation.\n\nll9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23486\n"};
