As a result of her disturbing and callous conduct, Maxwell nou faces the very real\nprospect of serving many years in prison. The strength of the Government’s evidence and the\nsubstantial prison term the defendant would face upon conviction all create a strong incentive for\nthe defendant to flee. That risk is only amplified by the defendant’s extensive international ties,\nher citizenship in two foreign countries, her wealth, and her lack of meaningful ties to the United\nStates.
