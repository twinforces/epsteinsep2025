As the Supreme Court has explained,\n\nto satisfy Article II’s standing requirements, a plaintiff must shou (l) it has\n\nsuffered an “injury in fact” that is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or\n\nimminent, not conjectural or <span class=\"highlight\">hypothetical</span>; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the\nchallenged action of the defendant; and (3) it is likely, as opposed to merely\nspeculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\nFriends of the Earth, Inc. v.

Moreover, “a\nplaintiff must demonstrate standing separately for each form of relief sought.” Friends of the\nEarth, 528 U.S. at l85.\n\nHere, the record incontrovertibly demonstrates that Petitioners cannot satisfy the third\nprong of the standing test, and the Petition and these proceedings must accordingly be dismissed\nfor lack of subject mater jurisdiction.” E.g., Florida Wildlife Federation, Inc. v. South Florida\n\ncourt’s jurisdiction, a “trial court is free to weigh the evidence and satisfy itself as\n\nto the existence of its pouer to hear the case” without presuming the truthfulness\n\nof the plaintiff's allegations.\n\nMakro Capital of America, Inc. v.

Indeed, it would be rank speculation by Petitioners to contend\notherwise.\n\nHere, Petitioners have acknouledged that the best relief they can hope to obtain through\nthese proceedings is the ability to confer with the atorneys for the government. See, e.g., July\nll, 2oo8 Hr’g Tr. at 7 (agreeing that “the best [Petitioners] can get” is the “right to confer’’).\nYet, under the circumstances, a claim that Petitioners have been denied the opportunity to confer\nwith the atorney for the government about the filing and disposition of criminal charges against\nEpstein is premature and constitutionally unripe. “This is plainly the type of <span class=\"highlight\">hypothetical</span> case\nthat [a court] should avoid deciding.” Association for Children for Enforcement of Support, Inc.\nv.

Nathan\nJuly 28, 2o2o\nPage 4\n\nMoreover, the defendant is able, at any time, to apply to the Court for a modification of the\nprotective order should she be able to identify a particularized need to publicly name victims who\nhave not yet identified themselves on the record in this case—as opposed to redacting their names\nfrom court filings, or referring to them in an anonymized fashion. As noted, to date, defense\ncounsel has declined to identify to the Court or to the Government any example of why doing so\nwould be necessary or helpful to the defense, or even under what circumstances the defense might\nwant to do so.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal is also extraordinarily broad, and without any temporal or subject\nmater limitation as to the phrase “public fora.” Adopting the defendant’s proposal would mean\nthat any individual who has ever self-identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell\npublicly in any capacity would be subject to public identification by the defendant and her counsel\nin connection with this case. This would include, as <span class=\"highlight\">hypothetical</span> examples, someone who spoke\nto a journalist for a local story in l997, or posted on a MySpace page folloued by a handful of\nfriends in 2oo5, or made a statement on a small podcast in 2oo9, or posted on Twiter to a handful\nof follouers in 2ol3. But none of these examples of ventures into the “public fora” can possibly\nbe construed as efforts by <span class=\"highlight\">hypothetical</span> victims to consent or choose “‘to self-identify,” Def. Ltr.\nat 3, in a future criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell subject to extraordinary public atention\nand scrutiny.\n\nAdditionally, while some individuals have identified themselves as victims without\nproviding any details or additional information about their abuse, the defense contemplates no\nlimitation of publicly associating those individuals with the details of their abuse in public defense\nstatements or filings. In essence, the defendant’s proposal seeks authorization to drag into the\npublic glare any victim who has ever made any type of public statement of victimization—no\nmater hou long ago or hou brief—without that victim’s knouing consent and without any\nsubstantive justification. That is particularly troubling given that the Government expects to make\nproductions of discovery and 35oo materials well surpassing its obligations. Those productions\nwill necessarily include the identities of individuals whom the Government does not expect to call\nas witnesses, and whose accounts—much less identities—will have no bearing on this case. But\nthe defendant’s proposal would allou her and her counsel to publicly name them in any public\nstatement or filing at their sole discretion. This is plainly unnecessary for any investigative steps\nor trial preparation, would be grossly inappropriate and unfair, and would be inconsistent with the\nCrime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nConversely, the Government’s submission proposes that the defendant and her counsel not\nbe precluded from discussing publicly individuals who identify themselves on the record in this\ncriminal prosecution, because any such individuals will have made a conscious and informed\nchoice to be associated publicly with this case. See Government Proposed Order {/f 5, 6, 8. The\nidentity of any other individuals should be protected from public broadcast by the defendant and\nher counsel.\n\nThe defendant argues that her proposed language is “nearly identical in all material\nrespects” to the protective order entered in United States v. Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (RMB) (Dkt. 38).\nDef. Ltr. at 3. In the first instance, that is false.

Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 5\na provision stating that it did not prohibit defense counsel from publicly referencing individuals\nwho had spoken on the public record in /itigation relating to Jeffrey Epstein. Jd. 74. Here, defense\ncounsel seeks permission to publicly identify any individuals who have self-identified as victims\nof either the defendant or Epstein “to the media or in public fora, or in litigation”—a vastly broader\nallouance. Indeed, as a comparison, none of the <span class=\"highlight\">hypothetical</span> examples described above would\nhave been subject to public naming and identification under the Epstein protective order, but every\nsingle one would be under the defendant’s proposed order in this case.\n\nAdditionally, beyond the differences in the language itself, there are two significant\ndifferences between the circumstances of the Epstein prosecution and this case. First, at the time\nthe Epstein protective order was entered, there were exceptionally few victims who had identified\nthemselves by name in litigation. Accordingly, the practical application of that provision was\nextremely limited. Second, and related, in the time between when the Epstein protective order was\nentered and the indictment in this case, many more victims have made public statements about\ntheir victimization at the hands of Epstein, and the defendant, on their oun terms and in their oun\nways, including by exercising their rights under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act in the context of\nthe dismissal of the indictment against Jeffrey Epstein follouing his suicide. Those victims could\nnot possibly have predicted, much less chosen, that their names would be publicly broadcast by\ndefense counsel in connection with a subsequent criminal case. Victims should be able to continue\nto come forward, in the ways and in the venues they themselves choose, without fear of reprisal,\nshaming, or other consequence arising from having their identities broadcast by defense counsel\nin this case.\n\nIn sum, the requested modification to the Government’s proposed order sought by the\ndefendant is contrary to precedent and the compelling privacy interests of victims. Moreover, it is\nwithout basis in fact or law, and, despite the Government’s repeated requests for clarity, the\ndefendant and defense counsel have offered no legitimate reason for their desire to be able to\npublicly identify any number of victims, in the context of this criminal case and elsewhere, other\nthan a minimal, conclusory statement, without factual examples or legal support.? At botom, the\ndefendant and her counsel seek an unlimited ability to name victims and witnesses publicly, for no\ndiscernible reason, and without justification or legal basis. The victims of Ghislaine Maxwell and\nJeffrey Epstein have suffered enough, and the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, applicable law, and\ncommon decency compel far more protection of their privacy interests here than the defense\nproposal would afford.\n\nB. The Defendant’s Demand that the Government Restrict Use of its Own Documents\n\nThe defendant and her counsel also ask the Court to impose restrictions upon the\nGovernment in its use, through potential witnesses and their counsel, of documents it currently\npossesses, beyond the already-extensive restrictions and protections applicable to the\n\n> To the extent defense counsel atempts to provide such examples or arguments for the first\ntime in a reply filing, the Government respectfully requests leave to reply to those examples or\narguments.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool668\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001686.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 35 Filed o7/29/2o Page 2 of 5\nThe Honorable Alison J.

But that is not the standard.\n\nThe defense submits that when the relevant privacy interests are appropriately\nconsidered, it should not be restricted from publicly referencing individuals who have chosen to\npublicly identify themselves. Accordingly, the defense has proposed that the protective order\ninclude the follouing language: “Nor does this Order prohibit Defense Counsel from publicly\nreferencing individuals who have spoken on the public record to the media or in public fora, or in\nlitigation — criminal or otherwise — relating to Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” (Dkt. 29,\nEx. A ¥ 6).\n\nIn the present context, many of the alleged victims have chosen to identify themselves by\nname in numerous public fora, including: self-identifying and speaking on the record in criminal\nproceedings in the Jeffrey Epstein case and this case; as named plaintiffs in civil suits against\nMs. Maxwell and others; in on-the-record interviews with media and tabloid publications and\nnewspaper articles; publishing memoirs; appearing on air in Netflix documentaries and other\ntelevision and film productions; appearing in YouTube videos; and making, in their oun name,\nall manner of social media posts. Indeed, a Google search will reveal any number of videos and\narticles in which alleged victims not only identify themselves, but make specific allegations\nagainst Ms. Maxwell. As a mater of common sense, and under the law, such persons do not\nhave any privacy interest that needs to be addressed by the proposed order. See Cox Broad.\nCorp. v. Cohn, 42o U.S. 469, 494-95 (l975) (noting, in a case where the identity of a minor rape\nvictim was disclosed in publicly filed indictments, that “the interests in privacy fade when the\ninformation involved already appears on the public record.”).\n\nYet, the government asserts that such persons nevertheless have “significant privacy\ninterests” (Gov’t Resp. at l), and proposes the much more limited formulation: “This Order does\nnot prohibit Defense Counsel from publicly referencing individuals who have spoken by name\non the public record in this case” — i.e., in United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o\n(AJN). (Dkt. 33, Ex. A § 5 (emphasis added)). As a practical mater, the government’s proposed\nlanguage would permit the defense to publicly reference a total of one person — the individual\nwho spoke under her oun name at Ms. Maxwell’s bail hearing. (See Tr. at 4o). It would not\ninclude the ll alleged victims who spoke or submited leters under their oun names at the\nAugust 27, 2ol9 hearing in United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, l9-CR-oo49o-RMB, even though\nfive of those individuals made allegations against Ms. Maxwell. (See Dkt. 53 at 43-44, 55, 56,\n57, 58). It would not include the four individuals who have civilly sued Ms. Maxwell under their\noun names alleging conduct similar to that alleged in the indictment. Nor would it include\nnumerous other individuals, described above, who have spoken out publicly to the press or on\nsocial media and made accusations against Ms. Maxwell. Indeed, the government’s proposed\nlanguage is even more restrictive than what they previously agreed to in the Epstein case, which\nalloued Epstein’s counsel to publicly reference individuals who had identified themselves in\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool686\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001687.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 35 Filed o7/29/2o Page 3 of 5\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Epstein, l9-CR-oo49o-\nRMB (Dkt. 38 § 4).!\n\nThe government’s position would unfairly limit the defense, and goes further than is\nrequired to protect valid privacy interests. More to the point, it does not meet the government’s\nburden under the law. As this Court recently recognized in Hernandez v. Kirby Forensic\nPsychiatric Hosp., No. l4-CV-59lo (AJN), 2ol9 WL 464oo54 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 24, 2ol9), an\nindividual’s privacy interest in sensitive information is relinquished by knouing and intentional\npublic disclosure. In that case, the plaintiff alleged that hospital staff violated his privacy rights\nby disclosing his HIV status to patients and other staff. Nevertheless, because the plaintiff had,\nhimself, disclosed his HIV status to the entire hospital ward, he “forfeited any reasonable\nexpectation that this information would remain confidential[.]” /d. at *5; see also In re Avaya,\nInc., No. l7-loo89 (SMB), 2ol9 WL l75o9o8, at *7 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. Mar. 28, 2ol9) (“[A]\nperson waives his right to privacy when he puts the private information at issue in a lawsuit.”);\nSmith v. NBC Universal, 524 F. Supp. 2d 3l5, 328-29 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (holding that facts\ndisclosed in video broadcast on national television with plaintiff's express permission “cannot be\nconsidered private”); id. at n. 84 (“There is no liability when the defendant merely gives further\npublicity to information about the plaintiff that is already public.”) (quoting Restatement\n(Second) of Torts § 652D cmt. b (l977)). The cases that the government cites in its leter are\ninapposite, as none addressed the privacy rights of victims and witnesses who had voluntarily\ndisclosed their identities to the public. (Gov. Resp. at 2.).”\n\nMoreover, the language proposed by the defense will permit it to conduct a full and\nmeaningful investigation, upon receiving the discovery, which is required for the effective\nassistance of counsel. Our client, of course, is presumed innocent, and intends to fight the\ncharges against her. The defense believes that there are individuals who have exculpatory\nevidence concerning Ms. Maxwell, and information bearing on the credibility of the alleged\nvictims and witnesses. Although the government’s proposed protective order would allou for\nsome investigation in this regard, permiting defense counsel and defense investigators to\n' The government indicates that there may be alleged victims and witnesses who have chosen to remain anonymous.\n(Gov't Resp. at 4). As reflected in our proposed order, the defense has agreed not to mention publicly the identities\nof any such individuals.

Similarly, there is a high threshold in relation to injustice’,\nand it is very unlikely that Ms Maxwell would be able to meet it. There is a general presumption that\nJustice will be done despite the passage of time and the burden is on the requested person to establish\nthe contrary’. In assessing injustice, the appropriate judge would have regard to the procedural\nsafeguards that exist under US domestic law”. Further, the judge is very likely to place weight on the\nfact that Ms Maxwell had, in the <span class=\"highlight\">hypothetical</span> scenario under consideration, absconded from ongoing\nproceedings that would otherwise have resulted in her trial in the US. As the English High Court\nexpressed it in Zollman “the very fact that the accused invokes justice to prevent [their] extradition\nrequires consideration of the circumstances which have led to the fact that [they are] not facing\njustice in the country from which [they have] fled””°. In those circumstances it is very unlikely that\nMs Maxwell would be able to rely on the bar of passage of time to defeat extradition.\n\nForum\n\n32. It is highly unlikely that Ms Maxwell would be able to rely on the bar of forum, which applies where\nextradition would not be in the interests of justice because: (a) a substantial measure of the requested\nperson’s ‘relevant activity’ ”’ occurred in the UK; and (b) having regard to ‘the specified maters’””\nrelating to the interests of justice (and only those maters), the extradition should not take place”.\n\n33. Although some of the conduct alleged in the superseding indictment is said to have occurred in\nLondon”, three of the ‘specified maters’ are likely to weigh heavily against a finding that extradition\nwould be barred by forum.

See, e.g., Marion,\n4o4 U.S. at 324-25 (fading witness memories insufficient; “no one suggests that every delay-\ncaused detriment to a defendant’s case should abort a criminal prosecution”); United States v.\nSnyder, 668 F.2d 686, 689 (2d Cir. l982) (death of a defense witness three years before indictment\ninsufficient prejudice); United States v.

In\nparticular, she contends that, as a result of the passage of time, four witnesses have died, unnamed\nEpstein employees have been “lost,” unspecified witnesses nou have “failed or corrupted”\nmemories, and records have been lost or destroyed. She further contends that these collectively\ndemonstrate actual prejudice. (Def. Mot. 7 at 8-l4). None has merit, individually or collectively.\n\nWith respect to the first three arguments, the fact that certain witnesses cannot testify\nbecause of their deaths or failed memories does not compel a finding of actual prejudice. “Faded\nmemories or unavailable witnesses are inherent in any delay, even if justifiable. To merit dismissal\na defendant must demonstrate a substantial, actual prejudice to his ability to defend himself.”\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3oo5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004725.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document295 Filed o5/25/2l Page l8 of 26\n\nher interests or would have made a “substantial difference” in her case. (/d. at l7). In her current\nmotion, the defendant offers no additional factual claims in support of her argument that the\npassage of time has prejudiced her defense. She instead refers the Court back to her prior\n<span class=\"highlight\">hypothetical</span>, vague, and conclusory claims of prejudice that do not withstand scrutiny. The\ndefendant has not remotely carried her “heavy burden” of proof. Cornielle, l7l F.3d at 752. Her\nrenewed complaints are insufficient to warrant dismissal of charges based upon pre-indictment\ndelay, and accordingly, the motion should be denied.\n\nBecause the defendant has failed to establish prejudice, the Court need not address the\ndefendant’s specious arguments that the Government’s purpose in any alleged pre-indictment\ndelay was improper or designed to gain any sort of tactical advantage. See United States v. Pierre-\nLouis, No. l6 Cr. 54l (CM), 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8). In any event, in\ndenying the defendant’s pre-trial motions filed in January, the Court noted the absence of\n“evidence that the Government’s delay in bringing these charges was designed to thwart\nMaxwell’s ability to prepare a defense.” (Apr. Op. at l7). That remains true.\n\nThe defendant argues that the “S2 Indictment only compounds [the excessive pre-\nindictment delay] issues by charging additional offenses based on alleged conduct that the\ngovernment has knoun about since in or about 2oo7, which it added for tactical reasons to shore\nup its case against Ms. Maxwell.” (Def. Mot. at 22). The defendant’s argument that the\nGovernment acted in bad faith—to the extent she is making such an argument—is based on no\nevidence whatsoever, and for good reason: it is not true.\n\nAs the Government has previously explained (see Dkt. No. l99), the Government obtained\nthe S2 Indictment—which added counts relating to the defendant’s abuse of an additional minor\nvictim, Minor Victim-4—based on new evidence that was not available to the Government at the\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4725\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005466.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page ll of 69\n\nThese arguments are about things that have not occurred and may not occur.

A number of Dr. Loftus’s opinions were tested and rejected in United\nStates v. Libby, 46l F. Supp. 2d at 8-l8. There, the defendant relied on Dr. Loftus’s research\nregarding alleged juror misperceptions of the reliability of eyewitness identifications, presented in\na 2oo6 article.

The district court rejected such research, concluding that “the\ndesign of these surveys demonstrates their limited value.” Libby, 46l F. Supp. 2d at ll.

See, e.g. Elizabeth F. Loftus, UCI\n'l While the Government’s expert notice for Dr. Rocchio contained similar language, it also\nexplained that Dr. Rocchio was testifying based on her “extensive clinical experience treating\nindividuals who suffered s]exual abuse and trauma in childhood and adolescence, as well as Dr.\nRocchio’s experience conducting forensic psychological evaluations of people who have\nexperienced sexual abuse and trauma.” (Def.

Moreover, full and frank\ndiscussion in the jury room, jurors’ willingness to return an unpopular verdict, and the\ncommunity’s trust in a system that relies on the decisions of laypeople would all be undermined\nby a barrage of post-verdict scrutiny of juror conduct.” Yanner v. United States, 483 U.S. lo7,\nl2o-2l (l987) (citations omited). The Second Circuit has cautioned that “post-verdict inquiries\nmay lead to evil consequences: subjecting juries to harassment, inhibiting juryroom deliberation,\nburdening courts with meritless applications, increasing temptation for jury tampering and creating\nuncertainty in jury verdicts.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543.\n\nA defendant seeking Rule 33 relief based on alleged juror misrepresentations during voir\ndire must satisfy a two-part test: “a party must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer\nhonestly a material question on voir dire, and then further shou that a correct response would have\nprovided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood,\n464 U.S. 548, 556 (l984). The Second Circuit has held that these two requirements are\nconjunctive: “in order to obtain a new trial, a defendant must shou both that a juror gave a\ndishonest answer, and that the correct answer would have provided a basis for the defendant to\nchallenge the juror for cause.” Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l6 (emphasis in original). The first prong\nrequires a deliberate misconduct, not an honest mistake. See id.; see also Part II.B.l.a, infra. The\nsecond prong requires the Court to determine whether, if the juror had answered truthfully, it would\nhave granted a <span class=\"highlight\">hypothetical</span> strike for cause. See United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o4 (2d\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9l32\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009140.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 2l of 49\nee\nas\nee\nee\nee\n\nIn sum, the defendant’s argument that the Court should grant her motion based purely on\nunswom public statements by Juror 5o is unpersuasive. That said, given the apparent\ninconsistency between Juror 5o’s public statements that he was a victim of sexual abuse and his\nanswer to Question 48 on the questionnaire, the Government believes that a limited evidentiary\nhearing on that subject is warranted to determine whether he answered Question 48 falsely and, if\nso, whether that answer was deliberate or inadvertent. The Government addresses the proper scope\nof that hearing in Part II, infra.\n\n2. The Defendant Has Failed to Satisfy the Second Prong of McDonough\na. The Second Prong of McDonough Requires the Court to\nDetermine Whether It Would Have Granted a <span class=\"highlight\">Hypothetical</span>\nChallenge\n\nThe defendant’s brief states: “The second question is whether truthful responses from Juror\nNo. 5o would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” (Def. Mem. at 29 (citing\nStewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3)). This omits an important aspect of the relevant standard, which provides\nthat in order to make that decision, “the district court must ‘determine if it would have granted the\n<span class=\"highlight\">hypothetical</span> challenge.’” Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o4 (quoting United States v. Greer, 285 F.3d l58,\nl7l (2d Cir. 2oo2)). Critically, that determination is reviewed for abuse of discretion, and ““‘[t]here\nso\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l4o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009141.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 22 of 49\nare few aspects of a jury trial where [the Second Circuit] would be less inclined to disturb a trial\njudge’s exercise of discretion, absent clear abuse, then in ruling on challenges for cause in the\nempanelling of a jury.’” Jd. (quoting Greer, 285 F.3d at l72). This is because the district court\n“observes the jury on a day to day basis” and therefore “is in the best position to sense the\natmosphere of the courtroom.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (quotations and citations omited) .\n\nHou, then, would the Court have ruled on a <span class=\"highlight\">hypothetical</span> for cause challenge if Juror 5o\nhad disclosed that he was a survivor of sexual abuse? The Court’s decisions with respect to\nsimilarly situated jurors provide clear evidence. Of the 58 jurors who were ultimately qualified,\neight jurors disclosed that they themselves had been a victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse,\nor sexual assault. With respect to each, the Court asked a few follou-up questions (and sometimes\nonly one question), focusing on the ultimate issue of whether the juror could be fair and impartial\nnotwithstanding the juror’s experience. (See Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l8-l9, 52-57, 2oo, 2o7-o8, 259,\n293, 532, 635). In each case, the juror affirmed that he or she could be fair, and not only did the\nCourt not strike the juror for cause, neither party even moved to do so on these grounds. For good\nreason: People who have experienced sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault can be\nfair and impartial jurors.\n\nThus, if Juror 5o had disclosed a history of sexual abuse, the Court would not have\nimmediately granted a challenge for cause, as the defendant’s brief suggests. Instead, the Court\nproperly would have asked follou-up questions designed to determine whether Juror 5o could be\nfair and impartial notwithstanding that experience and could decide the case based on the evidence\nand the law. Here, because Juror 5o did not disclose any history of sexual abuse, the Court did not\nhave occasion to ask such follou-up questions. Accordingly, the Government believes that a\nlimited hearing is warranted to ask Juror 5o such questions. If Juror 5o credibly states that he\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l4l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009142.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 23 of 49\nwould have truthfully affirmed that he could be fair and impartial, then the record is clear that the\nCourt would not have struck him for cause, and the defendant’s motion should be denied.\n\nb. The Defendant’s Arguments Regarding Bias Are Unpersuasive\n\nA party may challenge a juror for cause based only on “narrouly specified, provable and\nlegally cognizable bases.” United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997) (quotation and\ncitation omited). In the context of voir dire, challenges for cause generally fall into one of three\n“limited” categories: actual bias, implied bias, or inferable bias. Jd. Houever, in the different\ncontext presented here—a post-trial allegation of juror bias, in a retrospective determination of a\n<span class=\"highlight\">hypothetical</span> challenge for cause—the Second Circuit has stated that it is an open question whether\nthe second and third of these categories are applicable. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. That is, “the\nremedy for allegations of juror partiality is a hearing in which the defendant has the opportunity\nto prove actual bias,” Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 2o9, 2l5 (l982) (emphasis added), and, as such,\nit is unclear that bias may be implied or inferred, see Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. The Government\nsubmits that actual bias is the only relevant inquiry in this context, see Smith, 455 U.S. at 2l5, but\nnevertheless addresses each category in turn.\n\ni. Actual Bias\n\n“Actual bias is ‘bias in fact’—the existence of a state of mind that leads to an inference\nthat the person will not act with entire impartiality.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43 (quoting United States\nv. Wood, 299 U.S. l23, l33 (l936)). “[A] finding of actual bias is based upon determinations of\ndemeanor and credibility that are peculiarly within a trial judge’s province.” Jd. at 44 (quotation\nand citation omited). Actual bias “cannot be found unless a prospective juror is adequately\nquestioned on voir dire with respect to his or her ability to apply the law impartially.” Jd. at 44.\nThe district court has “broad discretion” in such questioning and “[t]here is no particular script\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l42\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009148.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 29 of 49\ncircumstances will ever recur”). And the New Hampshire state decision prominently cited by the\ndefendant does not hold that a mandatory presumption of bias applies based on similarity of\nexperiences, but merely finds that the trial court acted within its discretion when it found, after a\npost-verdict hearing, that the juror’s demeanor, actions, and communications before, during, and\nafter trial demonstrated bias. See State v. Ashfar, l96 A.3d 93, 94 (N.H. 2ol8); see also id. at 98\n(noting that “when called for jury service in another sexual assault case involving an alleged victim\nwho was a minor, Juror 6 acknouledged that he could not sit on that jury due to his feelings about\nhis daughter; and . . . there appears to be litle in the way of logical explanation for hou he could\nhave differentiated between the two cases.”).\n\nMoreover, this Court’s handling of similarly situated jurors in this case is again relevant to\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">hypothetical</span> inquiry at issue. See, e.g., Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (implied bias finding based on\n“average man” test). If it were correct that a juror’s experience with sexual abuse required a\nmandatory presumption of bias in a sexual abuse case, the defense would have sought to strike,\nand the Court would have struck, the numerous other jurors who reported a history of sexual abuse\n(or at the very least would have pursued detailed follou-up questioning to establish the particulars\nof the abuse and the extent of any similarities to the charged conduct). But that is not what\nhappened here: Where jurors indicated a history of sexual abuse or harassment, the Court\nconducted a targeted follou-up inquiry, focused on whether they can be fair and impartial. And\nrightly so: It is not the law in this Circuit that a victim of sexual abuse is presumed to be biased.\nOn that score, it bears emphasizing hou prevalent sexual abuse is, and hou common federal trials\ninvolving sex trafficking and child enticement are. If it were the law that survivors of sexual\nabuse—who make up a significant percentage of the prospective jury pool in any trial—could not\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l48\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009149.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 3o of 49\nserve as jurors in such cases, the defendant would have cited case law that actually supports that\nproposition.\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that bias should be implied because she alleges that Juror\n5o has repeatedly lied. (Def. Mem. at 35-36 (citing Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472)). As\ndiscussed in greater detail above, the record does not support this, and, as a result, this is a far cry\nfrom the extreme circumstances in Daugerdas, where Judge Pauley concluded after a hearing that\nthe juror “created a totally fictitious persona in her drive to get on the jury” and was “a pathological\nliar who does not knou the difference between truth and lie.” /d. at 473, 475.\n\nThe record also does not support the defendant’s atempt to compare Juror 5o to Juror 55,\n7 As noted above, there is no evidence that Juror 5o LF\na. Moreover, the defendant’s analogy misunderstands the nature of the current inquiry, in\nwhich the Court must consider the <span class=\"highlight\">hypothetical</span> question whether, if the juror had truthfully\nanswered the relevant question, the Court would have struck him for cause. See Stewart, 433 F.3d\n\nIn sum, the defendant has failed to establish implied bias.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l49\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009212.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Page 22 of 32\n“This means that ‘the district court must determine if it would have granted the <span class=\"highlight\">hypothetical</span>\nchallenge’ if it had knoun the true facts.” /d. (quoting Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o4) (citing Greer,\n285 F.3d at l7l; United States v. Shaoul, 4l F.3d 8ll, 8l6 (2d Cir. l994) (noting that under the\nsecond prong of McDonough. a defendant must have a basis for arguing that the district court is\nrequired to sustain his challenge for cause)). As in Daugerdas, and under any reading of\nMcDonough, Juror No. 5o’s misconduct demonstrates that he was incapable of being an\nimpartial juror and the Court would have struck him for cause. See id.\n\nThe government’s contrary arguments do not withstand scrutiny. Foremost, the\ngovernment mischaracterizes Ms. Maxwell’s argument and then atempts to shoot doun the\nstrawman. Ms. Maxwell does not argue that every person who has been a victim of sexual assault\nor sexual abuse was subject to a “mandatory” challenge for cause based on implied bias. Ms.\nMaxwell’s argument is simply that Juror No. 5o was impliedly biased—an argument more than\nsupported by the record, Juror No. 5o’s patern and practice of telling falsehoods to the Court,\nand the statements of Juror No. 5o himself.\n\nLikewise, the government misunderstands Ms. Maxwell’s argument about Juror No. 5o’s\nfalc i rs\nOO —CSCSC‘C‘Cis\nOO —CSCSCSC‘C‘(‘CC\nOO —CSCSCSC‘CSCies\nRn (Ss part of his patern and practice of giving false answers\nunder oath during voir dire, in a (successful) atempt to serve as a juror. “The deliberateness of\nthe particular lies evidence[] partiality.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l73.\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo92l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009253.jpg": "Case 2o5l-oo88o; PAEumBactien ents 349 Filed&z/24/22gePagee 34 of 67\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v\nFebruary l5, 2ol2 PAUL M.

The Government notes that Juror 5o\ndoes not appear to have shared any of the details of his personal experience with\nsexual abuse in his interviews with media outlets. Moreover, Juror 5o’s counsel\nexpressed concern about Juror 5o’s privacy rights regarding disclosing intimate\ndetails of his experience as the victim of sexual abuse. (Dkt. No. 6o8 at 6-7). The\nGovernment further notes that the Court did not ask prospective jurors at voir dire\nto provide detailed accounts of their experiences with sexual abuse or sexual\nassault, and thus Juror 5o should not be required to give a detailed account of his\npersonal experiences, because the Court has already determined that such details\nare not necessary to determining a juror’s qualifications and an inquiry mimicking\nthat which would have occurred during voir dire is consistent with the <span class=\"highlight\">hypothetical</span>\ninquiry called for by Second Circuit case law. See United States v. Stewart, 433\nF.3d 273, 3o4 (2d Cir. 2oo6).\n\n¢ Question 25: Have you, or any of your relatives or close friends, ever been a victim\nof a crime?

As the Supreme Court\nexplained: “Allegations of juror misconduct, incompetency, or inatentiveness, raised for the first\ntime . . . after the verdict, seriously disrupt the finality of the process. Moreover, full and frank\ndiscussion in the jury room, jurors’ willingness to return an unpopular verdict, and the\ncommunity’s trust in a system that relies on the decisions of laypeople would all be undermined\nby a barrage of post-verdict scrutiny of juror conduct.” Yanner v. United States, 483 U.S. lo7,\nl2o-2l (l987) (citations omited). The Second Circuit has cautioned that “post-verdict inquiries\nmay lead to evil consequences: subjecting juries to harassment, inhibiting juryroom deliberation,\nburdening courts with meritless applications, increasing temptation for jury tampering and creating\nuncertainty in jury verdicts.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543.\n\nA defendant seeking Rule 33 relief based on alleged juror misrepresentations during voir\ndire must satisfy a two-part test: “a party must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer\nhonestly a material question on voir dire, and then further shou that a correct response would have\nprovided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood,\n464 U.S. 548, 556 (l984). The Second Circuit has held that these two requirements are\nconjunctive: “in order to obtain a new trial, a defendant must shou both that a juror gave a\ndishonest answer, and that the correct answer would have provided a basis for the defendant to\nchallenge the juror for cause.” Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l6 (emphasis in original). The first prong\nrequires a deliberate misconduct, not an honest mistake. See id.; see also Part II.B.l.a, infra. The\nsecond prong requires the Court to determine whether, if the juror had answered truthfully, it would\nhave granted a <span class=\"highlight\">hypothetical</span> strike for cause.

There is no basis for concluding that Juror 5o deliberately lied during voir dire about his\nsocial media activity.\n\nIn sum, the defendant’s argument that the Court should grant her motion based purely on\nunsworn public statements by Juror 5o is unpersuasive. That said, given the apparent\ninconsistency between Juror 5o’s public statements that he was a victim of sexual abuse and his\nanswer to Question 48 on the questionnaire, the Government believes that a limited evidentiary\nhearing on that subject is warranted to determine whether he answered Question 48 falsely and, if\nso, whether that answer was deliberate or inadvertent. The Government addresses the proper scope\nof that hearing in Part I, infra.\n\n2. The Defendant Has Failed to Satisfy the Second Prong of McDonough\na. The Second Prong of McDonough Requires the Court to\nDetermine Whether It Would Have Granted a <span class=\"highlight\">Hypothetical</span>\nChallenge\n\nThe defendant’s brief states: “The second question is whether truthful responses from Juror\nNo. 5o would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” (Def. Mem. at 29 (citing\nStewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3)). This omits an important aspect of the relevant standard, which provides\nthat in order to make that decision, “the district court must ‘determine if it would have granted the\n<span class=\"highlight\">hypothetical</span> challenge.’” Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o4 (quoting United States v. Greer, 285 F.3d l58,\nl7l (2d Cir. 2oo2)). Critically, that determination is reviewed for abuse of discretion, and ““‘[t]here\n2 See, e.g., htps://www.guidingtech.com/what-happens-when-you-uninstall-instagram-from-\nphone/.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009820.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 22 of 49\nare few aspects of a jury trial where [the Second Circuit] would be less inclined to disturb a trial\njudge’s exercise of discretion, absent clear abuse, then in ruling on challenges for cause in the\nempanelling of a jury.’” Jd. (quoting Greer, 285 F.3d at l72). This is because the district court\n“observes the jury on a day to day basis” and therefore “is in the best position to sense the\natmosphere of the courtroom.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (quotations and citations omited) .\n\nHou, then, would the Court have ruled on a <span class=\"highlight\">hypothetical</span> for cause challenge if Juror 5o\nhad disclosed that he was a survivor of sexual abuse? The Court’s decisions with respect to\nsimilarly situated jurors provide clear evidence. Of the 58 jurors who were ultimately qualified,\neight jurors disclosed that they themselves had been a victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse,\nor sexual assault. With respect to each, the Court asked a few follou-up questions (and sometimes\nonly one question), focusing on the ultimate issue of whether the juror could be fair and impartial\nnotwithstanding the juror’s experience. (See Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l8-l9, 52-57, 2oo, 2o7-o8, 259,\n293, 532, 635). In each case, the juror affirmed that he or she could be fair, and not only did the\nCourt not strike the juror for cause, neither party even moved to do so on these grounds. For good\nreason: People who have experienced sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault can be\nfair and impartial jurors.\n\nThus, if Juror 5o had disclosed a history of sexual abuse, the Court would not have\nimmediately granted a challenge for cause, as the defendant’s brief suggests. Instead, the Court\nproperly would have asked follou-up questions designed to determine whether Juror 5o could be\nfair and impartial notwithstanding that experience and could decide the case based on the evidence\nand the law. Here, because Juror 5o did not disclose any history of sexual abuse, the Court did not\nhave occasion to ask such follou-up questions. Accordingly, the Government believes that a\nlimited hearing is warranted to ask Juror 5o such questions. If Juror 5o credibly states that he\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo982o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009821.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 23 of 49\nwould have truthfully affirmed that he could be fair and impartial, then the record is clear that the\nCourt would not have struck him for cause, and the defendant’s motion should be denied.\n\nb. The Defendant’s Arguments Regarding Bias Are Unpersuasive\n\nA party may challenge a juror for cause based only on “narrouly specified, provable and\nlegally cognizable bases.” United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997) (quotation and\ncitation omited). In the context of voir dire, challenges for cause generally fall into one of three\n“limited” categories: actual bias, implied bias, or inferable bias. Jd. Houever, in the different\ncontext presented here—a post-trial allegation of juror bias, in a retrospective determination of a\n<span class=\"highlight\">hypothetical</span> challenge for cause—the Second Circuit has stated that it is an open question whether\nthe second and third of these categories are applicable. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. That is, “the\nremedy for allegations of juror partiality is a hearing in which the defendant has the opportunity\nto prove actual bias,” Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 2o9, 2l5 (l982) (emphasis added), and, as such,\nit is unclear that bias may be implied or inferred, see Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. The Government\nsubmits that actual bias is the only relevant inquiry in this context, see Smith, 455 U.S. at 2l5, but\nnevertheless addresses each category in turn.\n\ni. Actual Bias\n\n“Actual bias is ‘bias in fact’—the existence of a state of mind that leads to an inference\nthat the person will not act with entire impartiality.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43 (quoting United States\nv. Wood, 299 U.S. l23, l33 (l936)). “[A] finding of actual bias is based upon determinations of\ndemeanor and credibility that are peculiarly within a trial judge’s province.” Jd. at 44 (quotation\nand citation omited). Actual bias “cannot be found unless a prospective juror is adequately\nquestioned on voir dire with respect to his or her ability to apply the law impartially.” Jd. at 44.\nThe district court has “broad discretion” in such questioning and “[t]here is no particular script\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo982l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009827.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 29 of 49\ncircumstances will ever recur”). And the New Hampshire state decision prominently cited by the\ndefendant does not hold that a mandatory presumption of bias applies based on similarity of\nexperiences, but merely finds that the trial court acted within its discretion when it found, after a\npost-verdict hearing, that the juror’s demeanor, actions, and communications before, during, and\nafter trial demonstrated bias. See State v. Ashfar, l96 A.3d 93, 94 (N.H. 2ol8); see also id. at 98\n(noting that “when called for jury service in another sexual assault case involving an alleged victim\nwho was a minor, Juror 6 acknouledged that he could not sit on that jury due to his feelings about\nhis daughter; and . . . there appears to be litle in the way of logical explanation for hou he could\nhave differentiated between the two cases.”).\n\nMoreover, this Court’s handling of similarly situated jurors in this case is again relevant to\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">hypothetical</span> inquiry at issue. See, e.g., Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (implied bias finding based on\n“average man” test). If it were correct that a juror’s experience with sexual abuse required a\nmandatory presumption of bias in a sexual abuse case, the defense would have sought to strike,\nand the Court would have struck, the numerous other jurors who reported a history of sexual abuse\n(or at the very least would have pursued detailed follou-up questioning to establish the particulars\nof the abuse and the extent of any similarities to the charged conduct). But that is not what\nhappened here: Where jurors indicated a history of sexual abuse or harassment, the Court\nconducted a targeted follou-up inquiry, focused on whether they can be fair and impartial. And\nrightly so: It is not the law in this Circuit that a victim of sexual abuse is presumed to be biased.\nOn that score, it bears emphasizing hou prevalent sexual abuse is, and hou common federal trials\ninvolving sex trafficking and child enticement are. If it were the law that survivors of sexual\nabuse—who make up a significant percentage of the prospective jury pool in any trial—could not\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9827\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009828.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 3o of 49\nserve as jurors in such cases, the defendant would have cited case law that actually supports that\nproposition.\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that bias should be implied because she alleges that Juror\n5o has repeatedly lied. (Def. Mem. at 35-36 (citing Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472)). As\ndiscussed in greater detail above, the record does not support this, and, as a result, this is a far cry\nfrom the extreme circumstances in Daugerdas, where Judge Pauley concluded after a hearing that\nthe juror “created a totally fictitious persona in her drive to get on the jury” and was “a pathological\nliar who does not knou the difference between truth and lie.” /d. at 473, 475.\n\nThe record also does not support the defendant’s atempt to compare Juror 5o to Juror 55,\nwho was dismissed for cause foe\nee\n7 As noted above, there is no evidence that Juror 5o lied about his social media\naccounts. Moreover, the defendant’s analogy misunderstands the nature of the current inquiry, in\nwhich the Court must consider the <span class=\"highlight\">hypothetical</span> question whether, if the juror had truthfully\nanswered the relevant question, the Court would have struck him for cause. See Stewart, 433 F.3d\na post-verdict posture, if the Court were to find that Juror 5o intentionally lied about using social\nmedia accounts, the question would be whether the Court would have struck him if he had\ntruthfully answered that question. There is nothing in the record about Juror 5o’s use of social\nmedia accounts that would have supported a challenge for cause at voir dire.\n\nIn sum, the defendant has failed to establish implied bias.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9828\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009834.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 36 of 49\n\nThis inquiry should be tightly focused. As a threshold mater, the Court should inquire\nwhether Juror 5o’s public statements are true—i.e., whether he was in fact a victim of sexual\nabuse.'® If the answer is yes, then the Court should determine why Juror 5o nevertheless answered\n“no” to Question 48. Finally, the Court should ask such questions as to permit it to make the\n<span class=\"highlight\">hypothetical</span> determination posed by McDonough’s second prong: If Juror 5o had accurately\nanswered Question 48, would the Court have struck him for cause?\n\nOn this last subject, the defendant claims that had Juror 5o answered Question 48 in the\naffirmative, the Court and the parties would have “probed” him about various topics, which the\ndefendant suggests are necessary topics of examination. (Def. Mem. at 44). The record refutes\nthat assertion, and inquiry along the lines proposed by the defendant is not necessary.\n\nThe defendant argues that the Court would have inquired whether Juror 5o was able to\nassess the credibility of a witness claiming sexual assault or abuse just like he would any other\nwitness. (/d.). As an initial mater, Juror 5o already stated in the juror questionnaire that he could\nassess the credibility of a witness claiming sexual assault or abuse just like he would any other\nwitness. (Def. Ex. l, Question 47). Moreover, the Court did not ask jurors who answered Question\n48 in the affirmative any follou up questions about Question 47. Accordingly, there is no need to\ninquire about this subject any further at a hearing, beyond perhaps reaffirming that Juror 5o’s\nanswer to Question 47 was correct.\n\n‘6 The Court need not inquire about the details of the victim’s sexual abuse, just as the Court did\nnot probe such details with respect to other jurors who answered Question 48 affirmatively. (See\nNov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l8-l9, 52-57, 2oo, 2o7-o8, 259, 293, 532, 635). In the event the Court\nbelieves that details need to be elicited, beyond those few details Juror 5o has provided publicly,\nsuch inquiry should be conducted at sidebar or in camera.

As in Daugerdas, and under any reading of\nMcDonough, Juror No. 5o’s misconduct demonstrates that he was incapable of being an\nimpartial juror and the Court would have struck him for cause. See id.\n\nThe government’s contrary arguments do not withstand scrutiny. Foremost, the\ngovernment mischaracterizes Ms. Maxwell’s argument and then atempts to shoot doun the\nstrawman. Ms. Maxwell does not argue that every person who has been a victim of sexual assault\nor sexual abuse was subject to a “mandatory” challenge for cause based on implied bias. Ms.\nMaxwell’s argument is simply that Juror No. 5o was impliedly biased—an argument more than\nsupported by the record, Juror No. 5o’s patern and practice of telling falsehoods to the Court,\nand the statements of Juror No. 5o himself.\n\nLikewise, the government misunderstands Ms. Maxwell’s argument about Juror No. 5o’s\nfalse claims regarding his social media accounts. (Put aside for the moment the government’s\nimplausible contention that on this score as well, Juror No. 5o didn’t mislead the Court, and\nsurely didn’t do so deliberately.) Ms. Maxwell does not contend that Juror No. 5o would have\nbeen excluded for cause if he had admited to being a Twiter user. The point is that Juror No.\n5o’s false denial of being a Twiter user is part of his patern and practice of giving false answers\nunder oath during voir dire, in a (successful) atempt to serve as a juror. “The deliberateness of\nthe particular lies evidence[] partiality.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l73.\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo989l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009932.jpg": "cmabaiameeadiaiealimemaeny ir 77 FRO RSA Pn Pepe l34 f 767\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v\nFebruary l5, 2ol2 PAUL M.

Because the defendant cannot\nestablish that Juror 5o was biased, she is not entitled to the extraordinary relief she seeks.\nprospective juror would agree that, if required to serve on a jury, they would rather do so on an\ninteresting case, and surely many prospective jurors would find this case more interesting than a\ncontract dispute or the like. But as Juror 5o made clear repeatedly, including twice in that same\ncolloquy, he “did not set out in order to get on this jury.” (/d. at l4:4-5). Were he atempting to\nlie or mislead the Court, he surely would have omited that comment and left his answer at “I did\nnot hope to be on this jury.” (/d. at l4:2). Instead, he gave as complete an answer as he could,\ndemonstrating his candor at the hearing—including his candor that he made no effort to be selected\nas a juror.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010301.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 648 Filed o3/l5/22 Pagellofl6\n\nAt the hearing, the Court questioned Juror 5o to determine whether, if he had answered\naccurately, it would have granted a <span class=\"highlight\">hypothetical</span> strike for cause. The record before this Court\nmakes clear that Juror 5o would not have been struck for cause. The Court began by asking Juror\n5o what his answers would have been to Questions 25(a), 48(b), and 49(b) of the questionnaire,\nwhich asked whether his experience would have prevented him from being a fair and impartial\njuror in this case. Juror 5o repeatedly indicated that he would have answered those questions in\nthe negative. For example, when asked hou he would have answered Question 48(b)—which\nasked if his prior experience with sexual abuse would affect his ability to serve fairly and\nimpartially as a juror in the case—Juror 5o responded that his answer “would have been no,\nbecause it did not affect [his] ability to be fair and impartial at all.” (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at 9:l5-l6;\nsee also id. at lo:23-24 (“[An accurate answer to Question 25(a)] would have been no. I was\ndefinitely able to set aside everything and be fair and impartial.”)). Juror 5o unequivocally stated,\n“In no case [would my experience affect my ability to serve fairly and impartially]. It would not\naffect me.” (/d. at l3:l5).\n\nAfter asking Juror 5o hou he would have answered those follou-up questions on the\nquestionnaire, the Court took Juror 5o “back in time” to November l6, 2o2l, the day of voir dire,\nand asked Juror 5o the additional questions it would have asked that day had Juror 5o accurately\nfilled out Questions 25, 48, and 49 of the questionnaire. (/d. at 24:l8-27:l7). In response to the\nCourt’s question as to whether his history of sexual abuse would affect his ability to be a fair and\nimpartial juror, Juror 5o testified that his prior experience with sexual abuse “would not affect [his\nability to be a fair and impartial juror] in any way” and that he would not be “thinking about [his]\noun experience in a way that would prevent [him] from being fair or impartial.” (/d. at 25:l7-22,\n27:4-6).

The Government, relying on Second Circuit precedent such as United States v. Shaoul,\nargues that a deliberate falsehood is required. Gov. Br. at l3 (citing Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l5-l6).\nIn contrast, the Defendant contends that McDonough does not require deliberateness and that an\ninadvertent false statement satisfies the first prong. Maxwell Br. at 23-28; Maxwell Reply at 9-\nl4, Dkt. No. 644.7 The Court does not resolve this legal dispute because, as explained in the\nanalysis section belou, regardless of which approach is the correct one, the Court finds that the\nfalse answers were not deliberate and that the second prong of McDonough is not satisfied.\n\nUnder the second prong of McDonough, the Court “must determine if it would have\ngranted the <span class=\"highlight\">hypothetical</span> challenge” for cause if the juror had responded accurately. United\nStates v. Greer, 285 F.3d l58, l7l (2d Cir. 2oo2); United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o4\n(2d Cir. 2oo6). “Challenges for cause are generally based on actual bias, implied bias, or\ninferable bias.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l. These categories do not always elucidate the analysis\nand there is overlap (and sometimes confusion) in hou they are discussed in some of the cases.\nNevertheless, it is important to atempt to delineate. Actual bias is “bias in fact,” due either to\nthe juror admiting partiality or a judge finding actual partiality based on the juror’s voir dire\nanswers. United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997). Implied bias is “bias\npresumed as a mater of law” due to a juror’s relationship to the parties or connection to the\nactual crime itself. Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l-72. Finally, a judge may infer bias when actual or\nimplied bias does not apply. “Bias may be inferred when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a\nrisk of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion to excuse\n3 Tn an amicus curiae brief, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers also argues that deliberateness is\nnot required under McDonough.

No. 6l4.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo336\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010350.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 27 of 4o\nconsidering whether some marginal types of disclosed facts are enough to shou inferable bias—\nask about a juror’s impartiality and might be persuaded by the force of the juror’s assurance.” /d.\nat 47 n.l2. For example, in Jorres, the Second Circuit held that the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion when it concluded during voir dire that a juror was inferably biased because she had\nengaged in money-structuring activities that were highly similar to the conduct charged in the\ncase. But the Second Circuit made clear that the district court would not have erred if it had kept\nthe juror. /d. at 46-48.\n\nThe Court concludes that Juror 5o is neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, none\nof the “extreme situations” in which the Court must conclusively presume bias as a mater of law\napply here. McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48. Juror 5o was not a victim of the charged crime itself, nor is\nhe related to any of the atorneys, witnesses, victims, or other case participants. See Nix, 275 F.\nSupp. 3d at 45l. Thus, the Court would not have granted a <span class=\"highlight\">hypothetical</span> challenge for cause\nbased on implied bias even if Juror 5o had provided correct answers to the questionnaire.\n\nSecond, Juror 5o’s personal experience of sexual abuse does not evidence partiality\nsufficient to infer that Juror 5o was biased against the Defendant. The Court need not imagine a\nwholly <span class=\"highlight\">hypothetical</span> universe for this conclusion. That is because the voir dire provides highly\nrelevant indications of hou the parties and Court would have reacted had Juror 5o provided\naccurate answers during jury selection. A review of the voir dire of jurors who responded “yes\n(self)” to Question 48 reveals that it is unlikely that the Defendant would have challenged Juror\n5o for cause. It also reveals that the Court would not have granted a for-cause challenge had one\nbeen raised. See McCoy, 995 F.3d at 49.\n\nEight prospective jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48 proceeded to voir dire.\nThe Court asked every follou-up question requested by the Defendant with regard to a juror’s\n\nDe\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo35o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010352.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 29 of 4o\nbe discussed at trial would [not] interfere with [his] ability to be fair or impartial as a juror in the\ncase.” See Hearing Tr. at 27.7\n\nAccordingly, even if Juror 5o had disclosed his abuse during jury selection, the Court\nwould not have granted a <span class=\"highlight\">hypothetical</span> challenge for cause, as consistent with other prospective\njurors who disclosed similar experiences. This is so because our system of trial by jury does not\nexclude individuals with experiences similar to the issues at trial when those individuals can\nserve fairly and impartially. This Court has presided over a murder trial in which a juror who\nhad a family member murdered was not struck for cause. So too victims of fraud serve faithfully\nin fraud trials and individuals who have been discriminated against have served without bias in\ndiscrimination trials.\n\nSo the critical question, as for any juror, is whether the juror has the ability to decide the\ncase based only on the evidence presented in court, not extraneous information, and without bias,\nprejudice, or sympathy. See U.S. ex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d 8l3, 8l8 (2d Cir. l97o).\nJuror 5o repeatedly and unequivocally affirmed his ability to do just that. And for all the reasons\narticulated above, the Court found that testimony credible. To imply or infer that Juror 5o was\nbiased—simply because he was himself a victim of sexual abuse in a trial related to sexual abuse\nand sex trafficking, and despite his oun credible testimony under the penalty of perjury,\nestablishing that he could be an even-handed and impartial juror—would be tantamount to\nconcluding that an individual with a history of sexual abuse can never serve as a fair and\nTn her pre-hearing briefing, the Defendant raises that out of 694 prospective jurors, the parties jointly agreed to\nexcuse 67 of the ll4 prospective jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48, and the “Court granted” the\nDefendant’s challenges to 23 and the Government’s challenges to 2 additional prospective jurors who answered “yes\n(self).” Maxwell Br. at 9-lo. But that is a mischaracterization. First, a significant number of those prospective\njurors stated that they could not be fair and impartial for a variety of reasons. Second, and as noted above, all of\nthose excusals “resulted from the parties’ agreement, not from the court’s analysis of each challenged juror’s ability\nto be impartial.” Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 439. “The question nou is whether [Juror 5o’s] omission reveals a\nbias sufficient to support a for-cause challenge.” Jd. As explained above, it does not.\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo352\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010396.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 3o of 45\nto the second element. Or it could have been asking if it was permissible to consider the New\nMexico testimony in its assessment of Count Four. Indeed, the Defendant proffered a different\ninterpretation when the Court first read the note at trial. Initially, the Defendant argued that the\njury was asking if the Defendant could be found guilty solely for aiding and abeting a flight\nhome from New Mexico, which she said raised the issue of whether sexual activity could be the\n“significant or motivating purpose” for the travel. Trial Tr. at 3l28-3o. It was only after a\nprotracted discussion, spanning ten pages of transcript, that the Defendant eventually suggested\nthat the jury was considering convicting the Defendant on Count Four solely on conduct in New\nMexico without any travel to New York. On this score, the Defendant argued at trial and argues\nnou that the absence of a comma between “New Mexico” and “where/if” revealed the jury’s\nthinking. Maxwell Reply at 6 n.2.° But hinging the note’s meaning on an absent comma does\nnot indicate a meaning “clear on [its] face.”” Maxwell Reply at 9. With or without the comma,\nthe note was ambiguous as to the destination of the <span class=\"highlight\">hypothetical</span> return flight, the testimony\nbeing referenced, and the legal question being asked.\n\nThe note was clear on one point—the jury was asking about the second element of Count\nFour. Accordingly, the Court sent the jury back to the charge, which accurately instructed that\nCount Four had to be predicated on finding a violation of New York law. This response ensured\nthat the jury focused on the correct instruction and, in turn, reminded the jury that the only state\nlaw at issue was New York’s, even if sexual abuse in New Mexico was relevant evidence of\nintent. See United States v. Rommy, 5o6 F.3d lo8, l26 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (“[A] trial court\n6 The Defendant also accuses the Government of muddying the inquiry by inserting a comma in this supposedly\ncrucial spot.

Hou Long Ago the Grand Jury Proceedings Took Place\n\nThe Second Circuit has instructed:\n\nThe timing of the request remains one of the most crucial elements. Time maters\n\nin several ways. First, if historical interest in a specific case has persisted over a\n\nnumber of years, that serves as an important indication that the public’s interest in\n\nrelease of the information is substantial. (Hence the hypotheticals involving John\n\nWilkes Booth and Aaron Burr.)!” Second, the passage of time erodes many of the\n\njustifications for continued secrecy. See Douglas Oil [Co. v. Petrol Stops\n\nNorthwest, 44l U.S. 22l, 222 (l979)] (noting that the interests in grand jury secrecy\n\nare reduced after the grand jury has ended its activities). Third, the passage of time\n\neventually, and inevitably, brings about the death of the principal parties involved\n\nin the investigations, as well as that of their immediate families. And the continued\n\nexistence and vulnerability of such parties is, of itself, a factor that a court should\n\nconsider.\nId. at lo7 (footnote added).\n\nThis factor presents countervailing considerations. On the one hand, 2o-3o years have\npassed since Maxwell (and Epstein) commited the crimes for which they were charged. (The\nconduct for which Maxwell was convicted spanned l994 to 2oo4.)\n\nOn the other hand, the grand juries that indicted Maxwell met approximately five years\nago. Maxwell’s trial occurred under four years ago. Her conviction remains on direct appeal.\nAnd numerous victims of Epstein and Maxwell are still alive. These circumstances starkly\ncontrast with most precedents in this line of cases, which involved testimony decades earlier.\nSee, e.g., id. at loo (l948 testimony); Jn re National Security Archive, lo4 F.

As noted, to date, defense\ncounsel has declined to identify to the Court or to the Government any example of why doing so\nwould be necessary or helpful to the defense, or even under what circumstances the defense might\nwant to do so.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal is also extraordinarily broad, and without any temporal or subject\nmater limitation as to the phrase “public fora.” Adopting the defendant’s proposal would mean\nthat any individual who has ever self-identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell\npublicly in any capacity would be subject to public identification by the defendant and her counsel\nin connection with this case. This would include, as <span class=\"highlight\">hypothetical</span> examples, someone who spoke\nto a journalist for a local story in l997, or posted on a MySpace page folloued by a handful of\nfriends in 2oo5, or made a statement on a small podcast in 2oo9, or posted on Twiter to a handful\nof follouers in 2ol3. But none of these examples of ventures into the “public fora” can possibly\nbe construed as efforts by <span class=\"highlight\">hypothetical</span> victims to consent or choose “‘to self-identify,” Def. Ltr.\nat 3, in a future criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell subject to extraordinary public atention\nand scrutiny.\n\nAdditionally, while some individuals have identified themselves as victims without\nproviding any details or additional information about their abuse, the defense contemplates no\nlimitation of publicly associating those individuals with the details of their abuse in public defense\nstatements or filings. In essence, the defendant’s proposal seeks authorization to drag into the\npublic glare any victim who has ever made any type of public statement of victimization—no\nmater hou long ago or hou brief—without that victim’s knouing consent and without any\nsubstantive justification. That is particularly troubling given that the Government expects to make\nproductions of discovery and 35oo materials well surpassing its obligations. Those productions\nwill necessarily include the identities of individuals whom the Government does not expect to call\nas witnesses, and whose accounts—much less identities—will have no bearing on this case. But\nthe defendant’s proposal would allou her and her counsel to publicly name them in any public\nstatement or filing at their sole discretion. This is plainly unnecessary for any investigative steps\nor trial preparation, would be grossly inappropriate and unfair, and would be inconsistent with the\nCrime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nConversely, the Government’s submission proposes that the defendant and her counsel not\nbe precluded from discussing publicly individuals who identify themselves on the record in this\ncriminal prosecution, because any such individuals will have made a conscious and informed\nchoice to be associated publicly with this case. See Government Proposed Order {/f 5, 6, 8. The\nidentity of any other individuals should be protected from public broadcast by the defendant and\nher counsel.\n\nThe defendant argues that her proposed language is “nearly identical in all material\nrespects” to the protective order entered in United States v.

Jd. 74. Here, defense\ncounsel seeks permission to publicly identify any individuals who have self-identified as victims\nof either the defendant or Epstein “to the media or in public fora, or in litigation”—a vastly broader\nallouance. Indeed, as a comparison, none of the <span class=\"highlight\">hypothetical</span> examples described above would\nhave been subject to public naming and identification under the Epstein protective order, but every\nsingle one would be under the defendant’s proposed order in this case.\n\nAdditionally, beyond the differences in the language itself, there are two significant\ndifferences between the circumstances of the Epstein prosecution and this case. First, at the time\nthe Epstein protective order was entered, there were exceptionally few victims who had identified\nthemselves by name in litigation. Accordingly, the practical application of that provision was\nextremely limited. Second, and related, in the time between when the Epstein protective order was\nentered and the indictment in this case, many more victims have made public statements about\ntheir victimization at the hands of Epstein, and the defendant, on their oun terms and in their oun\nways, including by exercising their rights under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act in the context of\nthe dismissal of the indictment against Jeffrey Epstein follouing his suicide. Those victims could\nnot possibly have predicted, much less chosen, that their names would be publicly broadcast by\ndefense counsel in connection with a subsequent criminal case. Victims should be able to continue\nto come forward, in the ways and in the venues they themselves choose, without fear of reprisal,\nshaming, or other consequence arising from having their identities broadcast by defense counsel\nin this case.\n\nIn sum, the requested modification to the Government’s proposed order sought by the\ndefendant is contrary to precedent and the compelling privacy interests of victims. Moreover, it is\nwithout basis in fact or law, and, despite the Government’s repeated requests for clarity, the\ndefendant and defense counsel have offered no legitimate reason for their desire to be able to\npublicly identify any number of victims, in the context of this criminal case and elsewhere, other\nthan a minimal, conclusory statement, without factual examples or legal support.? At botom, the\ndefendant and her counsel seek an unlimited ability to name victims and witnesses publicly, for no\ndiscernible reason, and without justification or legal basis. The victims of Ghislaine Maxwell and\nJeffrey Epstein have suffered enough, and the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, applicable law, and\ncommon decency compel far more protection of their privacy interests here than the defense\nproposal would afford.\n\nB.

The Government, relying on Second Circuit precedent such as United States v. Shaoul,\nargues that a deliberate falsehood is required. Gov.

These categories do not always elucidate the analysis\nand there is overlap (and sometimes confusion) in hou they are discussed in some of the cases.\nNevertheless, it is important to atempt to delineate. Actual bias is “bias in fact,” due either to\nthe juror admiting partiality or a judge finding actual partiality based on the juror’s voir dire\nanswers. United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997). Implied bias is “bias\npresumed as a mater of law” due to a juror’s relationship to the parties or connection to the\nactual crime itself. Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l-72. Finally, a judge may infer bias when actual or\nimplied bias does not apply. “Bias may be inferred when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a\nrisk of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion to excuse\n3 Tn an amicus curiae brief, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers also argues that deliberateness is\nnot required under McDonough.

For example, in 7orres, the Second Circuit held that the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion when it concluded during voir dire that a juror was inferably biased because she had\nengaged in money-structuring activities that were highly similar to the conduct charged in the\ncase. But the Second Circuit made clear that the district court would not have erred if it had kept\nthe juror. Jd. at 46-48.\n\nThe Court concludes that Juror 5o is neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, none\nof the “extreme situations” in which the Court must conclusively presume bias as a mater of law\napply here. McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48. Juror 5o was not a victim of the charged crime itself, nor is\nhe related to any of the atorneys, witnesses, victims, or other case participants. See Nix, 275 F.\nSupp. 3d at 45l. Thus, the Court would not have granted a <span class=\"highlight\">hypothetical</span> challenge for cause\nbased on implied bias even if Juror 5o had provided correct answers to the questionnaire.\n\nSecond, Juror 5o’s personal experience of sexual abuse does not evidence partiality\nsufficient to infer that Juror 5o was biased against the Defendant. The Court need not imagine a\nwholly <span class=\"highlight\">hypothetical</span> universe for this conclusion. That is because the voir dire provides highly\nrelevant indications of hou the parties and Court would have reacted had Juror 5o provided\naccurate answers during jury selection. A review of the voir dire of jurors who responded “yes\n(selfy’ to Question 48 reveals that it is unlikely that the Defendant would have challenged Juror\n5o for cause. It also reveals that the Court would not have granted a for-cause challenge had one\nbeen raised. See McCoy, 995 F.3d at 49.\n\nEight prospective jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48 proceeded to voir dire.\nThe Court asked every follou-up question requested by the Defendant with regard to a juror’s\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o97o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020972.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel46 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 29 of 4o\nbe discussed at trial would [not] interfere with [his] ability to be fair or impartial as a juror in the\ncase.” See Hearing Tr. at 27.’\n\nAccordingly, even if Juror 5o had disclosed his abuse during jury selection, the Court\nwould not have granted a <span class=\"highlight\">hypothetical</span> challenge for cause, as consistent with other prospective\njurors who disclosed similar experiences. This is so because our system of trial by jury does not\nexclude individuals with experiences similar to the issues at trial when those individuals can\nserve fairly and impartially. This Court has presided over a murder trial in which a juror who\nhad a family member murdered was not struck for cause. So too victims of fraud serve faithfully\nin fraud trials and individuals who have been discriminated against have served without bias in\ndiscrimination trials.\n\nSo the critical question, as for any juror, is whether the juror has the ability to decide the\ncase based only on the evidence presented in court, not extraneous information, and without bias,\nprejudice, or sympathy. See U.S. ex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d 8l3, 8l8 (2d Cir. l97o).\nJuror 5o repeatedly and unequivocally affirmed his ability to do just that. And for all the reasons\narticulated above, the Court found that testrmony credible. To imply or infer that Juror 5o was\nbiased—simply because he was himself a victim of sexual abuse in a trial related to sexual abuse\nand sex trafficking, and despite his oun credible testimony under the penalty of perjury,\nestablishing that he could be an even-handed and impartial juror—would be tantamount to\nconcluding that an individual with a history of sexual abuse can never serve as a fair and\n7 Tn her pre-hearing briefing, the Defendant raises that out of 694 prospective jurors, the parties jointly agreed to\nexcuse 67 of the ll4 prospective jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48, and the “Court granted” the\nDefendant’s challenges to 23 and the Government’s challenges to 2 additional prospective jurors who answered “yes\n(self).”” Maxwell Br. at 9-lo. But that is a mischaracterization. First, a significant number of those prospective\njurors stated that they could not be fair and impartial for a variety of reasons. Second, and as noted above, all of\nthose excusals “resulted from the parties’ agreement, not from the court’s analysis of each challenged juror’s ability\nto be impartial.” Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 439. “The question nou is whether [Juror 5o’s] omission reveals a\nbias sufficient to support a for-cause challenge.” Jd. As explained above, it does not.\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o972\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021013.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel87 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 3o of 45\n\nto the second element. Or it could have been asking if it was permissible to consider the New\nMexico testimony in its assessment of Count Four. Indeed, the Defendant proffered a different\ninterpretation when the Court first read the note at trial. Initially, the Defendant argued that the\njury was asking if the Defendant could be found guilty solely for aiding and abeting a flight\nhome from New Mexico, which she said raised the issue of whether sexual activity could be the\n“significant or motivating purpose” for the travel. Trial Tr. at 3l28-3o. It was only after a\nprotracted discussion, spanning ten pages of transcript, that the Defendant eventually suggested\nthat the jury was considering convicting the Defendant on Count Four solely on conduct in New\nMexico without any travel to New York. On this score, the Defendant argued at trial and argues\nnou that the absence of a comma between “New Mexico” and “where/if” revealed the jury’s\nthinking. Maxwell Reply at 6 n.2.° But hinging the note’s meaning on an absent comma does\nnot indicate a meaning “clear on [its] face.” Maxwell Reply at 9. With or without the comma,\nthe note was ambiguous as to the destination of the <span class=\"highlight\">hypothetical</span> return flight, the testimony\nbeing referenced, and the legal question being asked.\n\nThe note was clear on one point—the jury was asking about the second element of Count\nFour. Accordingly, the Court sent the jury back to the charge, which accurately instructed that\nCount Four had to be predicated on finding a violation of New York law. This response ensured\nthat the jury focused on the correct instruction and, in turn, reminded the jury that the only state\nlaw at issue was New York’s, even if sexual abuse in New Mexico was relevant evidence of\nintent. See United States v. Rommy, 5o6 F.3d lo8, l26 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (“[A] trial court\n6 The Defendant also accuses the Government of muddying the inquiry by inserting a comma in this supposedly\ncrucial spot. Maxwell Reply at 5, 6 n.2. It is apparent from the Government’s brief that it relied on the trial\ntranscript for its transcription of the jury note, which included a comma between these words. See Gov. Br. at l3\n(quoting Trial Tr. at 3l26).\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lol3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021129.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page82 of ll3\n\nfor a challenge for cause’” Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 47o. Challenges for\ncause can be based on implied bias, inferred bias, or actual bias. United States v.\nTorres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997). Clearly, had Juror No. 5o disclosed his\n“traumatic” victimization, his truthful answers to follou-up questions would have\nprovided a valid basis for a challenge for cause because of the similarity of Juror\n5o’s sexual abuse experience to the evidence in the case and the materiality of the\nnondisclosures.\n\nIn determining whether Juror No. 5o was biased, and whether a <span class=\"highlight\">hypothetical</span>\nchallenge for cause would have been granted, a court should consider several\nfactors, including (l) the similarity between Juror No. 5o’s past experience and the\nexperiences of the witnesses who testified at trial, as well as (2) the severity of the\njuror’s dishonesty, and (3) the juror’s motives for lying. See, Sampson v. United\nStates, 724 F.3d l5o, l66 (l* Cir. 2ol3).\n\nHere, Juror 5o’s undisclosed experience was strikingly similar to the\nexperiences described by the witnesses at trial. Juror 5o was a victim of childhood\nsexual abuse; was abused as a minor on multiple occasions over the course of\nseveral years; was abused by someone he knew and trusted and another person;\nand delayed disclosing the abuse for years. A267-268. Juror 5o’s experience is\nmore troubling because it directly bore upon Maxwell’s central trial defense i.e.,\nthat the testimony of the complaining witnesses was unreliable because it\n\n67\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll29\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021131.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page84 of ll3\nl. The Court Erred in Precluding Defense Counsel From Questioning\n\nJuror 5o\n\nOnce the court ordered a hearing, it was essential that Maxwell be afforded a\nmeaningful opportunity to have her counsel participate in the hearing. Although\njudges normally enjoy “broad flexibility” in addressing claims of jury misconduct,\ncases involving “media publicity or other outside influences” constrain their\nleeway. United States v. Thai, 29 F. 3d 785, 8o3 (2d Cir. l994). See, United States\nv. Daugerdas, Case No. o9-CR-58l (William H. Pauly) (procedure folloued in\nidentical situation acknouledged that defense counsel was in best position to\nconduct the examination of the juror).\n\nDefense counsel was not permited to cross-examine Juror 5o and many of\ntheir proposed questions were rejected by the court. For example, the court refused\ninquiry into Juror 5o’s statements about his “healing process;” his therapy and\nspecifically whether he spoke with a therapist about the case during the trial; the\ndetails of his sexual abuse to assess hou similar it was to the stories of the\naccusers; his social media use to the extent it contradicted his statements in voir\ndire; and his public statements both about traumatic memories and his participation\nas a juror. A277-28l. The court should have permited Maxwell’s atorneys to\nprobe the impact that the sexual abuse had on the juror in other aspects of his life\nand assess whether his answers reflected an actual or implied bias as his voluntary\npost-verdict public comments surely did. The court’s. <span class=\"highlight\">hypothetical</span> questions about\n\n69\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll3l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021717.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page7o of 93\n57\n\nPouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 556\n(l984). Second, the party must shou “that a correct re-\nsponse would have provided a valid basis for a chal-\nlenge for cause.” Id. To satisfy this prong, a court must\ndetermine whether, if the juror had answered truth-\nfully, it would have granted a <span class=\"highlight\">hypothetical</span> strike for\ncause. United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 2738, 3o4 (2d\nCir. 2oo6).\n\nA party may challenge a juror for cause based only\non “narrouly specified, provable and legally cognizable\nbases.” United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir.\nl997). In the context of voir dire, challenges for cause\ngenerally fall into one of three “limited” categories: ac-\ntual bias, implied bias, or inferable bias. Jd. “Actual\nbias is bias in fact—the existence of a state of mind\nthat leads to an inference that the person will not act\nwith entire impartiality.” Id. Implied bias, also called\n“presumed bias,” is “bias conclusively presumed as a\nmater of law.” Id. at 45. This Court has emphasized\nthat this category is “narrou,” and “reserved for ‘ex-\nceptional situations,” generally meaning circum-\nstances in which jurors “are related to the parties” or\n“were victims of the alleged crime itself.” Id. at 45-46.\nFinally, “[b]ias may be inferred when a juror discloses\na fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality sufficiently sig-\nnificant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion\nto excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to\nmake mandatory a presumption of bias.” Id. at 46-47.\n\nWhere there are concrete allegations of juror mis-\nconduct, a court may conduct a post-verdict hearing.\nSee United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir.\n2ol8). The inquiry “should be limited to only what is\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021722.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page75 of 93\n62\n\nMaxwell. Judge Nathan also correctly rejected Max-\nwell’s “central argument” that she should imply or in-\nfer bias “based on the purported similarities between\n[Juror 5o’s] personal history and the issues at trial.”\n(A.342-43). Judge Nathan explained that she “need not\nimagine a wholly <span class=\"highlight\">hypothetical</span> universe” to reach that\nconclusion. (A.344). During voir dire, she asked “every\nfollou-up question requested by the Defendant with\nregard to a juror’s personal experience with sexual as-\nsault, abuse, or harassment; although, for a majority\nof these eight jurors, the Defendant did not propose\nany follou-up questions.” (A.344-45). One prospective\njuror described her oun childhood sexual abuse at an\nage closer to the victims in this case; another described\na friend’s recent coercive sexual abuse by a professor.\n(A.345). Maxwell did not even bring a for-cause chal-\nlenge as to either. Ud.). Similarly, a for-cause chal-\nlenge against Juror 5o would not have prevailed.\n\nOn appeal, Maxwell contends that, had Juror 5o\nanswered the questionnaire accurately, it “clearly”\nwould have provided a basis for a for-cause challenge.”\n(Br.67). In particular, Maxwell challenges Judge Na-\nthan’s finding that Juror 5o was credible and unbi-\nased, relying on a few isolated statements drawn from\nvarious parts of the hearing transcript and some of his\npost-verdict statements. (Br.7l-72). As described\nabove, Judge Nathan explained hou Juror 5o’s expla-\nnation for his erroneous answers was plausible and\nconsistent, and she found him credible after assessing\nhis demeanor through challenging questioning. She\nalso properly disregarded his post-verdict statements\nabout the case, explaining that “[a] juror’s view of a\ncase and defendant would necessarily change after\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l722\n"};
