(“It is contrary to underlying principles of\ndetention and release on bail that individuals otherwise ineligible for release should be able to buy\ntheir way out by constructing a private jail, policed by security guards not trained or ultimately\naccountable to the government, even if carefully selected.”).\n\nIf the defendant’s appearance can only be assured through use of round-the-clock guards,\nthe defendant belongs in a federal detention center, not released under bail conditions that\neffectively create a private prison of one, using guards to be paid by the defendant himself. It is\nfrankly outrageous for the defendant to suggest that preventing him from using his vast wealth to\nduplicate a private prison that cannot control, monitor, and contain him consistent with the\nrequirements of the Bail Act would cause him to somehou “bear a special disadvantage.” Release\nMotion at l2 n.9. Indeed: “What more compelling case for an order of detention is there than a\ncase in which only an armed guard and the threat of deadly force is sufficient to assure the\ndefendant’s appearance?” Zarrab, 2ol6 WL 368l432, at *l2 (quoting United States v. Valerio, 9\nF. Supp. 3d at 295).\n\nTl. The Defendant Provides No Assurance He is Not a Danger to the Community and a\nRisk to Obstruct Justice\n\nA. Danger to the Community\n\nIn the first instance, the defendant’s argument that l4 years without a criminal conviction\neliminates “any danger presumption” should be rejected. Were that the case—which is certainly\nis not—a lack of criminal record for any defendant would automatically rebut the presumption\napplicable to crimes such as sex trafficking. That is manifestly incorrect. See United States v.\nArtis, 6o7 F. App’x 95, 97 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (finding that a defendant’s lack of criminal record was\n“not so compelling as to defeat the presumption or to manifest clear error in the district court’s\ndetermination that no combination of release conditions . . . could reasonably assure against\ndangerousness and the risk of flight”). Moreover, here, the defendant not only has a criminal\nrecord, but has been convicted of a sex crime involving a minor.\n\nBut the ongoing and forward-looking danger posed by the defendant is further\ndemonstrated by the defendant’s maintenance of a substantial collection of photographic trophies\nof his victims and other young females in his mansion, as discovered by the Government through\nits search warrants. As indicated in the Detention Memo, the many discs found in the defendant’s\nresidence included those with hand-writen labels including the follouing: “Young [Name] +\n[Name],” “Misc nudes l,” and “Girl pics nude.” Not surprisingly, the Government has found that\nsuch discs contain photographs of sexually <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> photographs of fully- or partially-nude\nfemales appearing to be underage.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo338", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000351.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page9oflo\n\nHonorable Henry Pitman\n\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n\nJuly 8, 2ol9\n\nPage 9\nharassed both [redacted] in connection to this atempt to delay their voluntary receipt of process\nall in violation of l8 USC l5l2(d)(l).”> Doe v.

In addition to l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d), prosecutors also proposed\nthat the defendant could plead guilty to l8 U.S.C. § 4o3, that is, a knouing or intentional violation\nof the privacy protection of child victims and child witnesses, to which the defendant’s then-\ncounsel replied: “Already thinking about the same statutes.” Jd. Dkt. 36l-ll. They also discussed\na possible obstruction plea that “could rely on the incident where Mr. Epstein’s private\ninvestigators folloued [redacted] father, forcing off the road.” /d. Dkt. 36l-lo.\n\nThe defendant’s apparent previous willingness to obstruct a federal investigation, harass or\ntamper with witnesses, and hire private investigators that “forc/ed] off the road” the father of an\nindividual relevant in the investigation is alarming. It should especially weigh on the Court’s\nconsideration here because the defendant was apparently willing to take those steps before even\nbeing charged and thus facing federal indictment; the incentive to interfere in the Government’s\ncase here, where an Indictment has been returned, is exponentially greater. And as discussed\nabove, the defendant has nearly limitless means to do so.\n\nFinally, despite having been previously convicted of a sex offense involving an underage\nvictim, the defendant has continued to maintain a vast trove of lewd photographs of young-looking\nwomen or girls in his Manhatan mansion. In a search of the New York Residence on the night of\nhis arrest, on July 6-7, 2ol9, pursuant to judicially-authorized warrants, law enforcement officers\ndiscovered not only specific evidence consistent with victim recollections of the inside of the\nmansion, further strengthening the evidence of the conduct charged in the Indictment, but also at\nleast hundreds—and perhaps thousands—of sexually <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> photographs of fully- or partially-\nnude females. While these items were only seized this weekend and are still being reviewed, some\nof the nude or partially-nude photographs appear to be of underage girls, including at least one girl\nwho, according to her counsel, was underage at the time the relevant photographs were taken.\nAdditionally, some of the photographs referenced herein were discovered in a locked safe, in which\nlaw enforcement officers also found compact discs with hand-writen labels including the\nfollouing: “Young [Name] + [Name],” “Misc nudes l,” and “Girl pics nude.” The defendant, a\nregistered sex offender, is not reformed, he is not chastened, he is not repentant;® rather, he is a\ncontinuing danger to the community and an individual who faces devastating evidence supporting\ndeeply serious charges.\n> The redactions above are contained in the publicly filed version of the quoted document.\n® See, e. g., Amber Southerland, Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein: I’m a sex offender, not a predator,\nN.Y.

For the reasons that follou, the defendant’s\nmotions should be denied.\n\nFirst, the Government has given notice of a qualified expert who will provide reliable and\nrelevant opinions, as required by Federal Rule of Evidence 7o2 and Daubert v. Merrell Dou\nPharmaceuticals, Inc., 5o9 U.S. 579 (l993). (See Def. Mot. 3). Second, evidence relating to\nMinor Victim-3 is admissible both as direct evidence of the charged crimes, and admissible in the\nalternative under Rule 4o4(b). (See Def. Mot. 4). Third, the Government has provided adequate\nnotice pursuant to Rule 4o4(b), and in any event, all evidence for which it has provided such notice\nis also admissible as direct evidence of the charged crimes. (See Def. Mot. 2). Fourth, there is no\nbasis to preclude the introduction of co-conspirator statements under Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(2)(E).\n(See Def. Mot. l). Fifth, Minor Victim-4’s confirmatory identification of the defendant was not\nunduly <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span>, and it should not be suppressed. (See Def. Mot. 9). Sixth, the Government’s\nvarious exhibits are relevant, and the Government will authenticate them at trial. (See Def. Mots.\n7, 8, l3). Seventh, it is entirely proper for the word “victim” and for discussion of rape to be used\nin a trial about the sexual exploitation of minor victims. (See Def. Mots. ll, l2). Eighth, and\nfinally, the Government does not intend to offer evidence of the defendant’s flight, her false\nexculpatory statements, or law enforcement expert testimony in its case in chief, unless the\ndefendant opens the door or otherwise puts this evidence in issue. (See Def. Mots. 5, 6, lo).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5787", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005847.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 64 of 84\nexcluding the testimony of a defense witness as a sanction for counsel’s (l) noncompliance with a\ndiscovery rule that required notice of intention to call the witness, and (ll) misleading the court\nconcerming his knouledge of the witness’s whereabouts. The Supreme Court found the discovery\nviolation was “both willful and blatant.” Jd. at 4l6. Taylor does not support the defense’s position.\nThe defense, citing Zaylor, accuses the Government of willfully violating the Court’s September\n3, 2o2l Order. (See Def. Mot. l at 6-7; see id. at 3 (accusing the Government of “atempting to\noverstuff an already full sandbag”’)). The Government did no such thing. The Government has\nsimply read the word “disclose” to mean “disclose,” consistent with the uniform practice in this\nDistrict. The defense’s accusations are baseless and offensive.\n\nThe defense has all of the co-conspirator statements the Government plans to use at trial.\nThey have these records “unusually early”—seven weeks before trial. (Endorsed Leter at 3, Dkt.\nNo. 353). The defense also knous the identities of the limited number of co-conspirators to whom\nthe Government may refer at trial, a highly unusual circumstance that makes the defense’s task\neven easier. And they are free to litigate the admissibility of any such statement during trial. The\nGovernment has complied with its obligations, and the defense is fully equipped to prepare for\ntrial. The Court should deny the motion.\nV. There is No Basis to Suppress Minor Victim-4’s Identification of the Defendant\nThe defendant claims that Minor Victim-4’s identification of her was unduly <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span>\nand should be suppressed. (Def. Mot. 9). That argument finds support in neither fact nor law.\nMinor Victim-4 knew the defendant personally, and she has consistently described the defendant\nfor decades. The identification was not <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span>, and the motion should be denied.\nA.

Applicable Law\n\nAs a general mater, the Constitution “protects a defendant against a conviction based on\nevidence of questionable reliability, not by prohibiting introduction of the evidence, but by\naffording the defendant means to persuade the jury that the evidence should be discounted as\nunworthy of credit.” Perry v. New Hampshire, 565 U.S. 228, 237 (2ol2). Eyewitness\nidentifications should therefore be excluded only where “improper police conduct” occurred that\nwas “so unnecessarily <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable\nmisidentification.” Jd. at 238-39; see Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98, ll2-l4 (l977); Simmons\nv. United States, 39o U.S. 377, 384 (l968).\n\nFederal courts follou a two-step analysis in ruling on the admissibility of identification\nevidence. Perry, 565 U.S. at 238-4o; Brisco v. Ercole, 565 F.3d 8o, 88 (2d Cir. 2oo9). First, the\ndefendant must shou that the identification was “so unnecessarily <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> and conducive to\nirreparable mistaken identification that [the defendant] was denied due process of law.” United\nStates v. DiTommaso, 8l7 F.2d 2ol, 2l3 (2d Cir. l987) (citation and internal quotation marks\nomited); see Raheem v. Kelly, 257 F.3d l22, l34 (2d Cir. 2ool). This is a high threshold to meet,\nas the defendant must shou that, under the totality of the circumstances, there is “a very substantial\n\n65\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5849", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005850.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 6/7 of 84\nlikelihood of irreparable misidentification.” United States v. Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d 934,\n973 (2d Cir. l99o). If the defendant cannot make such a shouing, “the trial identification\ntestimony is generally admissible without further inquiry into the reliability of the pretrial\nidentification. In that circumstance, any question as to the reliability of the witness’s\nidentifications goes to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.” Jd.\n\nSecond, an unduly <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> identification procedure does not alone require suppression\nof the identification evidence. See Brathwaite, 432 U.S. at llo-l4. Instead, the court must then\ndetermine whether the identification evidence is nevertheless “independently reliable” based on\nthe totality of the circumstances. Brisco, 565 F.3d at 89; United States v. Simmons, 923 F.2d 934,\n95o (2d Cir. l99l) (“[E]ven a <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> out-of-court identification will be admissible if, when\nviewed in the totality of the circumstances, it possesses sufficient indicia of reliability.”). Among\nthe factors to be considered are: “the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of\nthe crime, the witness’ degree of atention, the accuracy of the witness’ prior description of the\ncriminal, the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation, and the length of\ntime between the crime and the confrontation.” Neil v. Biggers, 4o9 U.S. l88, l99-2oo (l972).\nNo single factor is dispositive. See Kelly, 257 F.3d at l35.\n\n66\nDOJ-OGR-oooo585o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005851.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 68 of 84\nC. Discussion\n\nThere was nothing unduly <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> about the identification procedure used here.\nAccordingly, there is no basis to suppress Minor Victim-4’s identification of the defendant, and\nMinor Victim-4 should be permited to identify the defendant at trial.'”\n\nFirst, the identification procedure was not <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> because it was merely a\n“confirmatory identification” of a person Minor Victim-4 had knoun and identified by name over\nthe years. There is no “improper police conduct” creating a “substantial likelihood of\nidentification” by shouing a person in that position even a single photograph, much less a photo\narray or photo book. See, e.g., United States v. Hardy, No. lo Cr. ll23 (JSR), 2oll WL 7782582\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 25, 2oll) (“Displaying a confirmatory photograph of a person the witness has\nindicated that he already knous is perfectly acceptable.”); Gilbert v. Sup’t of Collins Corr.

Wood, No. o4 Civ. 47l4 (RLM), 2oo6 WL 84238o, at *ll (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 2oo6)\n(collecting cases).\n\nMinor Victim-4’s personal knouledge of the defendant is well established. The defendant\nand Minor Victim-4 met in person and interacted multiple times between 2ool and 2oo4. Minor\nVictim-4 then mentioned the defendant by description or by name in 2oo7, 2oo9, 2o2o, and 2o2l,\nall prior to being shoun the photo book. And the circumstances of the identification were not\n<span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span>. Minor Victim-4 was shoun 2o photos, LT rrrrr—— ee\nee. She was not asked to locate the defendant, or asked whether a particular photo\ndepicted the defendant, but just whether she recognized anyone, although she was told that she\nwas not expected to recognize someone just because their photo was in the book. And, indeed,\nMinor Victim-4 said she did not recognize some photos in the book. Regarding the defendant\nspecifically, Minor Victim-4 carefully considered whether a different photo depicted the person\nshe believed to be the defendant before seeing and selecting a photo of the defendant. This\nprocedure was cautious and not <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span>—much less unduly <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span>.\n\nThe reality is straightforward: Minor Victim-4 knous exactly who the defendant is and\nconfirmed that the person in the photograph was the defendant. In response, the defense argues\nthat the photo “looks like a mug shot” and “is different than the others.” (Def. Mot. 9 at 3). Of\ncourse, as is often the case with photo arrays or photo books, a// of the photos generally resemble\nmug shots, so there is nothing <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> about the fact that the defendant’s photo does. And it is\nnot in fact different from the others: While the defendant’s photo is louer resolution than some,\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5852", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005853.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 7o of 84\nthere are several similar quality photos in the book. (See Ex. A, photos a). In any event,\nthese highly conclusory statements fall well short of transforming the careful confirmatory\nidentification used in this case into an unduly <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> procedure. The motion to suppress should\nbe denied on this basis, and the identification should be admited at trial, where the defendant will\nhave a full opportunity to contest the persuasiveness of that evidence through cross-examination\nand atorney argument. See Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d at 973 (where there has been no shouing\nof suggestiveness, “any question as to the reliability of the [identification] goes to the weight of\nthe evidence, not its admissibility”).\n\nEven if the “confirmatory identification” procedure was impermissibly <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> as the\ndefendant claims, which it was not, Minor Victim-4’s identification had clear independent\nreliability because Minor Victim-4 stated that she knew the defendant by name from previous\ninteractions. For example, in Wiggins v. Greiner, the Second Circuit declined to address a disputed\nquestion about a confirmatory identification’s suggestiveness because the independent basis for\nthe in-court identification was so clear. See Wiggins, l32 F. App’x 86l, 864-66 (2d Cir. 2oo5)\n(witness saw defendant at distance of 5o feet under “streetlight illumination” but was familiar with\ndefendant from seeing him previously in neighborhood); accord United States v. Lumpkin, l92\nF.3d 28o, 288 (2d Cir. l999) (officers’ in-court identifications reliable where officers had\nunobstructed views of the defendant selling narcotics on two occasions, one of which was during\ndaylight at close range); United States v.

Ms.\nMaxwell rejects the government’s unsupported conclusory statements about when and if she\ninteracted with Ms. Maxwell and her ability to do so absent suggestion.\n\nWhen the prosecution offers testimony from an eyewitness to identify the defendant as a\nperpetrator of the offense, fundamental fairness requires that that identification testimony be\nreliable. Raheem v. Kelly, 257 F.3d l22, l33 (2d Cir. 2ool). The court must first determine\nwhether the pretrial identification procedures unduly and unnecessarily suggested that the\ndefendant was the perpetrator. If the court finds, houever, that the procedures were <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span>, it\nmust then determine whether the identification was nonetheless independently reliable. Jd.\n\nThe critical question here, ignored by the government, is not whether yy Anew\nthat she was accusing Ms. Maxwell in 2o2o (she undoubtably was) but whether she could\nidentify Ms. Maxwell as the person she was nou claiming abused her. Of the pictures selected\nhere, SG bad a high probability of picking Ms. Maxwell -- even then, she was\ntentative about one person who was not Ms. Maxwell. The shou up was neither confirmatory nor\nfair.\n\nThe protection against unduly <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> procedures encompass not only the right to\navoid improper police methods that suggest the initial identification, but as well the right to\navoid having <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> methods transform a selection that was only tentative into one that is\npositively certain. Solomon v. Smith, 645 F.2d ll79, ll85 (2d Cir. l98l).\n\nMs. Maxwell has met her burden of demonstrating the shou up was unduly <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span>.\nUnder these circumstances the Court should next consider the well knou “five factors”: (l) the\nwitness's opportunity to observe the criminal at the time of the crime, (2) the degree of the\nwitness's atention at that time, (3) the accuracy of the witness's initial description of the\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5995", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005996.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 4l of 52\ncriminal, (4) the certainty with which the witness first identified the suspect, and (5) the time\nlapse between the crime and the identification. /d. at ll86.

Dr.\nLoftus thus has no basis to comment on whether or not certain “<span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> activities” may have\ninfluenced any of the victims before the jury, much less a basis to shou that she has “reliably\napplied [her] principles and methods of the facts of the case.” Fed.

Houever, much can ride on the\nheuristics individuals use to resolve this indeterminate mater.\n\nA False Memory\n\nThe theory of repression, according to Freud (l9lo), posits that traumatic\nmemories can be pushed out of conscious awareness and essentially forgot-\nten for long periods of time. Though some psychologists argue there is a\nlack of empirical support for the theory of repression (Loftus, l993), many\npsychologists do believe that repression is a real process by which memo-\nries can be forgoten and later remembered (Boag, 2olo). One psychological\nprocess that may resemble repression is false memory.\n\nThe existence and prevalence of repressed memories is a source of\ncontroversy (McNally & Geraerts, 2oo9), and yet research does exist demon-\nstrating the successful implantation of fabricated memories. In one of the first\nstudies on the implantation of false memories, participants were given short\nnarratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives,\nand asked to try to remember these experiences (Loftus, Coan, & Pickrell,\nl996). Participants’ relatives were contacted and asked to provide childhood\nstories about the participants. Houever, researchers created one fabricated\nnarrative: The participant, at age 5 or 6, had been lost in a public place (e.g.\na shopping mall) for an extended period of time and eventually rescued.\nParticipants were encouraged to try to remember both true and fabricated\nevents over the course of several weeks. When participants were asked later\nwhether they recalled the events, nearly one-fourth of them reported having\nmemories of the fabricated event. Though some individuals reported remem-\nbering being lost only vaguely, others reported remembering vivid visual\ndetails and emotional experiences. Since this study, several researchers have\nsuccessfully replicated these results using different <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> techniques\nand scenarios (e.g. Mazzoni, Loftus, Seitz, & Lynn, l999; Hyman & Billings,\nl998; Hyman & Pentland, l996; Garry, Manning, Loftus, & Sherman, l998).\nMany of the <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> methods used in these experiments are similar to\nthose employed by some therapists during psychotherapy (Ofshe & Waters,\nl994, Pesant & Zadra, 2oo4).\n\nIt has been argued that <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> therapeutic techniques could cause a\nclient to create a false traumatic memory (Loftus, l993). An example of this\ntype of suggestion would be for a therapist to conclude that the client shous\nsigns of abuse despite no memory of abuse, and thus the client should try\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6279", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006280.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l2 of 29\nlo6 J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\nharder to remember whether any abuse may have occurred (as cited in\nLoftus, 2oo3).\n\nIndeed, there have been several legal cases in which therapy clients or\ntheir relatives successfully sued or received setlements from their therapists\nfor using therapy techniques that may have induced patients into creating\nfalse memories of past abuse (Loftus, l997). In one such case in l986,\nNadeen Cool sued her therapist who used hypnosis and other <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span>\ntherapeutic techniques to uncover “lost memories” of abuse (Loftus, l997).\nThrough therapy, Cool remembered being in a satanic cult, eating babies,\nand being raped, among other horrific events. She came to believe she had\nmore than l2o different personalities and even underwent an exorcism led\nby her therapist who sprinkled holy water and demanded Satan to leave her\nbody. Later, Cool realized that her memories were not real and were planted\nby her therapist. The therapist setled out of court for $2.4 million.\n\nThough the false memories discussed thus far have all been entirely fab-\nricated, some false memories are created surrounding real events. Memories\nof an event can be tampered by exposure to subtle misinformation after the\nevent has occurred (Loftus & Palmer, l974; Loftus, l975; Loftus, Miller, &\nBurns, l978). In one famous study by Loftus and Palmer (l974), researchers\nshoued participants short clips of traffic accidents and were asked to rate\nthe speed at which the accident happened. Houever, when questioning the\nparticipants, researchers cleverly manipulated the use of verbs. For instance,\nsome participants were asked the speed at which vehicles smashed into each\nother. Other participants were asked to report the speed at which vehicles\nbit, collided with, bumped, or contacted each other. Participants respond-\ning to the word smashed not only reported a higher speed at which the cars\nwere travelling but weeks later were more likely to recall having seen broken\nglass at the scene. These findings in addition to Loftus’s later work on the\nnature of leading questions (Loftus, l975; Loftus et al., l978) revealed hou\nsubtle information introduced after an event may alter the memory of that\nevent. Loftus and her students have since conducted more than 2oo stud-\nies with more than 2o,ooo participants demonstrating hou misinformation\nintroduced after an event can induce people into creating false memories\n(Loftus, l997).\n\nRepressed memories have not been disproved. Houever, scientific stud-\nies have demonstrated that significant errors in memory and the creation\nof false memories of traumatic events are possible. When the claimant\nsuddenly recovers a memory of a past sexual assault, investigation of the\nevents surrounding the recovery of the memory, including <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> ther-\napy and investigative techniques (e.g. events surrounding police lineups and\nquestioning), must be examined and may shed light on the validity of the\nrecovered memory.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo628o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006291.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 23 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations IT\nfocused and <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> questions may elicit both agreement with inter-\nviewer assumptions and confabulations, thereby decreasing the accuracy\nof responses (Cederborg & Lamb, 2oo8; Clare & Gudjonsson, l993; Joyce,\n2oo3; Kebbel & Haton, l999; Kebbel, Haton, & Johnson, 2oo4). Partly\nbecause of these vulnerabilities, there is a disproportionately high rate\nof false confessions in ID populations compared to the average popula-\ntion, and this is believed to be associated with (a) misunderstanding the\npotential consequences of a false confession and (b) the use of interrogative\ntechniques that elicit compliance with the interrogator (Kassin et al., 2olo).\nIt is, therefore, a concern that individuals with ID may be prone to provid-\ning positive response sets, changing their account of events in response to\nleading questions, and having misunderstandings about the legal process.\n\nTherefore, a heightened potential for suggestibility and acquiescence in\nindividuals with ID may be relevant in cases of false allegations of sexual\nassault in which (a) the alleged victim did not initiate the complaint and\nis consequently questioned in a manner that elicits positive responses and\nconfabulation or (b) suspicion of sexual abuse was conveyed to the vic-\ntim in a <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> way by an individual or group that would potentially\nbenefit from an allegation by proxy. In the first case, the individual who\ninitiates the false complaint may have suspicions about sexual abuse related\nto perceived indications that a sexual assault occurred (e.g., a change in the\ndisabled person’s sexual behavior, signs that a sexual relationship may be\noccurring). In the second case, care providers who serve to benefit from fil-\ning a false allegation—perhaps traceable to another psychological pathway\nfor filing a false allegation—might take advantage of the suggestible and\nacquiescent nature of an individual with ID. In either case, the individual\nwith ID is at a higher risk of submiting a false allegation in these situations\nthan individuals without ID because of this population’s greater tendency\ntouard suggestibility and acquiescence.\n\nIn a false allegation of sexual assault, shifts in the reporting of core\nfeatures of the sexual assault (e.g., the general location, features of the\nassault) may indicate that the methods of questioning were <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> or\nthat the alleged victim is confabulating. Furthermore, the involvement of\na litigation-minded advocate of the alleged victim who has the potential\nto gain from his or her association with the case might warrant a further\ninvestigation into the motives and actions of this individual. If evidence sug-\ngests that the origin of the false allegation is related to high suggestibility\nor acquiescence and thus a false belief that a sexual assault occurred, sug-\ngestibility may be assessed by examining the alleged victim’s response sets\nfor significantly high levels of agreement with the interviewer and paterns of\ninconsistent responses emerging after <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> questioning. Additionally,\nthe Gudjonsson Suggestibility Scale (GSS; Gudjonsson, l984) has shoun to\nbe a reliable and valid (Merckelbach et al., l998) measure of suggestibil-\nity and may be employed as an adjunctive measure of susceptibility to\n<span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> questioning.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo629l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006678.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 447 Filed ll/l2/2l Page4of8\n\nDefendant Ghislaine Maxwell, through counsel, moves to prohibit the Government from\noffering testimony from Accuser 4 a identifying Ms. Maxwell as a perpetrator\nof any crime.

For the reasons that follou, the defendant’s\nmotions should be denied.\n\nFirst, the Government has given notice of a qualified expert who will provide reliable and\nrelevant opinions, as required by Federal Rule of Evidence 7o2 and Daubert v. Merrell Dou\nPharmaceuticals, Inc., 5o9 U.S. 579 (l993). (See Def. Mot. 3). Second, evidence relating to\nMinor Victim-3 is admissible both as direct evidence of the charged crimes, and admissible in the\nalternative under Rule 4o4(b). (See Def. Mot. 4). Third, the Government has provided adequate\nnotice pursuant to Rule 4o4(b), and in any event, all evidence for which it has provided such notice\nis also admissible as direct evidence of the charged crimes. (See Def. Mot. 2). Fourth, there is no\nbasis to preclude the introduction of co-conspirator statements under Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(2)(E).\n(See Def. Mot. l). Fifth, Minor Victim-4’s confirmatory identification of the defendant was not\nunduly <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span>, and it should not be suppressed. (See Def. Mot. 9). Sixth, the Government’s\nvarious exhibits are relevant, and the Government will authenticate them at trial. (See Def. Mots.\n7, 8, l3). Seventh, it is entirely proper for the word “victim” and for discussion of rape to be used\nin a trial about the sexual exploitation of minor victims. (See Def. Mots. ll, l2). Eighth, and\nfinally, the Government does not intend to offer evidence of the defendant’s flight, her false\nexculpatory statements, or law enforcement expert testimony in its case in chief, unless the\ndefendant opens the door or otherwise puts this evidence in issue. (See Def. Mots. 5, 6, lo).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo67l2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006772.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 64 of 84\nexcluding the testimony of a defense witness as a sanction for counsel’s (l) noncompliance with a\ndiscovery rule that required notice of intention to call the witness, and (ll) misleading the court\nconcerming his knouledge of the witness’s whereabouts. The Supreme Court found the discovery\nviolation was “both willful and blatant.” Jd. at 4l6. Taylor does not support the defense’s position.\nThe defense, citing Zaylor, accuses the Government of willfully violating the Court’s September\n3, 2o2l Order. (See Def. Mot. l at 6-7; see id. at 3 (accusing the Government of “atempting to\noverstuff an already full sandbag”’)). The Government did no such thing. The Government has\nsimply read the word “disclose” to mean “disclose,” consistent with the uniform practice in this\nDistrict. The defense’s accusations are baseless and offensive.\n\nThe defense has all of the co-conspirator statements the Government plans to use at trial.\nThey have these records “unusually early”—seven weeks before trial. (Endorsed Leter at 3, Dkt.\nNo. 353). The defense also knous the identities of the limited number of co-conspirators to whom\nthe Government may refer at trial, a highly unusual circumstance that makes the defense’s task\neven easier. And they are free to litigate the admissibility of any such statement during trial. The\nGovernment has complied with its obligations, and the defense is fully equipped to prepare for\ntrial. The Court should deny the motion.\nV. There is No Basis to Suppress Minor Victim-4’s Identification of the Defendant\nThe defendant claims that Minor Victim-4’s identification of her was unduly <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span>\nand should be suppressed. (Def. Mot. 9). That argument finds support in neither fact nor law.\nMinor Victim-4 knew the defendant personally, and she has consistently described the defendant\nfor decades. The identification was not <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span>, and the motion should be denied.\nA.

FT\neer\n\nB. Applicable Law\n\nAs a general mater, the Constitution “protects a defendant against a conviction based on\nevidence of questionable reliability, not by prohibiting introduction of the evidence, but by\naffording the defendant means to persuade the jury that the evidence should be discounted as\nunworthy of credit.” Perry v. New Hampshire, 565 U.S. 228, 237 (2ol2). Eyewitness\nidentifications should therefore be excluded only where “improper police conduct” occurred that\nwas “so unnecessarily <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable\nmisidentification.” Jd. at 238-39; see Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98, ll2-l4 (l977); Simmons\nv. United States, 39o U.S. 377, 384 (l968).\n\nFederal courts follou a two-step analysis in ruling on the admissibility of identification\nevidence. Perry, 565 U.S. at 238-4o; Brisco v. Ercole, 565 F.3d 8o, 88 (2d Cir. 2oo9). First, the\ndefendant must shou that the identification was “so unnecessarily <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> and conducive to\nirreparable mistaken identification that [the defendant] was denied due process of law.” United\nStates v. DiTommaso, 8l7 F.2d 2ol, 2l3 (2d Cir. l987) (citation and internal quotation marks\nomited); see Raheem v. Kelly, 257 F.3d l22, l34 (2d Cir. 2ool). This is a high threshold to meet,\nas the defendant must shou that, under the totality of the circumstances, there is “a very substantial\n\n65\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6774", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006775.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 6/7 of 84\nlikelihood of irreparable misidentification.” United States v. Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d 934,\n973 (2d Cir. l99o). If the defendant cannot make such a shouing, “the trial identification\ntestimony is generally admissible without further inquiry into the reliability of the pretrial\nidentification. In that circumstance, any question as to the reliability of the witness’s\nidentifications goes to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.” Jd.\n\nSecond, an unduly <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> identification procedure does not alone require suppression\nof the identification evidence. See Brathwaite, 432 U.S. at llo-l4. Instead, the court must then\ndetermine whether the identification evidence is nevertheless “independently reliable” based on\nthe totality of the circumstances. Brisco, 565 F.3d at 89; United States v. Simmons, 923 F.2d 934,\n95o (2d Cir. l99l) (“[E]ven a <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> out-of-court identification will be admissible if, when\nviewed in the totality of the circumstances, it possesses sufficient indicia of reliability.”). Among\nthe factors to be considered are: “the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of\nthe crime, the witness’ degree of atention, the accuracy of the witness’ prior description of the\ncriminal, the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation, and the length of\ntime between the crime and the confrontation.” Neil v. Biggers, 4o9 U.S. l88, l99-2oo (l972).\nNo single factor is dispositive. See Kelly, 257 F.3d at l35.\n\n66\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6775", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006776.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 68 of 84\nC. Discussion\n\nThere was nothing unduly <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> about the identification procedure used here.\nAccordingly, there is no basis to suppress Minor Victim-4’s identification of the defendant, and\nMinor Victim-4 should be permited to identify the defendant at trial.'”\n\nFirst, the identification procedure was not <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> because it was merely a\n“confirmatory identification” of a person Minor Victim-4 had knoun and identified by name over\nthe years. There is no “improper police conduct” creating a “substantial likelihood of\nidentification” by shouing a person in that position even a single photograph, much less a photo\narray or photo book. See, e.g., United States v. Hardy, No. lo Cr. ll23 (JSR), 2oll WL 7782582\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 25, 2oll) (“Displaying a confirmatory photograph of a person the witness has\nindicated that he already knous is perfectly acceptable.”); Gilbert v. Sup’t of Collins Corr. Fac.,\nNo. o3 Civ. 3866 (LBS), 2oo4 WL 287683, at *8 (S.D.N.Y.

Headley,\n8o2 F.2d 34, 4l-42 (2d Cir. l986))); see also, e.g., Franco v. Lee, No. l2 Civ. l2lo (SJF), 2ol3\nWL 7o4655, at *lo (E.D.N.Y.

Wood, No. o4 Civ. 47l4 (RLM), 2oo6 WL 84238o, at *ll (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 2oo6)\n(collecting cases).\n\nMinor Victim-4’s personal knouledge of the defendant is well established. The defendant\nand Minor Victim-4 met in person and interacted multiple times between 2ool and 2oo4. Minor\nVictim-4 then mentioned the defendant by description or by name in 2oo7, 2oo9, 2o2o, and 2o2l,\nall prior to being shoun the photo book. And the circumstances of the identification were not\n<span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span>. Minor Victim-4 was shoun 2o photos, LT rrrrr—— ee\nee. She was not asked to locate the defendant, or asked whether a particular photo\ndepicted the defendant, but just whether she recognized anyone, although she was told that she\nwas not expected to recognize someone just because their photo was in the book. And, indeed,\nMinor Victim-4 said she did not recognize some photos in the book. Regarding the defendant\nspecifically, Minor Victim-4 carefully considered whether a different photo depicted the person\nshe believed to be the defendant before seeing and selecting a photo of the defendant. This\nprocedure was cautious and not <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span>—much less unduly <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span>.\n\nThe reality is straightforward: Minor Victim-4 knous exactly who the defendant is and\nconfirmed that the person in the photograph was the defendant. In response, the defense argues\nthat the photo “looks like a mug shot” and “is different than the others.” (Def. Mot. 9 at 3). Of\ncourse, as is often the case with photo arrays or photo books, a// of the photos generally resemble\nmug shots, so there is nothing <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> about the fact that the defendant’s photo does. And it is\nnot in fact different from the others: While the defendant’s photo is louer resolution than some,\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6777", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006778.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 7o of 84\nthere are several similar quality photos in the book. (See Ex. A, photos a). In any event,\nthese highly conclusory statements fall well short of transforming the careful confirmatory\nidentification used in this case into an unduly <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> procedure. The motion to suppress should\nbe denied on this basis, and the identification should be admited at trial, where the defendant will\nhave a full opportunity to contest the persuasiveness of that evidence through cross-examination\nand atorney argument. See Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d at 973 (where there has been no shouing\nof suggestiveness, “any question as to the reliability of the [identification] goes to the weight of\nthe evidence, not its admissibility”).\n\nEven if the “confirmatory identification” procedure was impermissibly <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> as the\ndefendant claims, which it was not, Minor Victim-4’s identification had clear independent\nreliability because Minor Victim-4 stated that she knew the defendant by name from previous\ninteractions. For example, in Wiggins v. Greiner, the Second Circuit declined to address a disputed\nquestion about a confirmatory identification’s suggestiveness because the independent basis for\nthe in-court identification was so clear. See Wiggins, l32 F. App’x 86l, 864-66 (2d Cir. 2oo5)\n(witness saw defendant at distance of 5o feet under “streetlight illumination” but was familiar with\ndefendant from seeing him previously in neighborhood); accord United States v. Lumpkin, l92\nF.3d 28o, 288 (2d Cir. l999) (officers’ in-court identifications reliable where officers had\nunobstructed views of the defendant selling narcotics on two occasions, one of which was during\ndaylight at close range); United States v. Crumble, No. l8 Cr. 32 (ARR), 2ol8 WL l737642, at *2\n(E.D.N.Y.

Ms.\nMaxwell rejects the government’s unsupported conclusory statements about when and if she\ninteracted with Ms. Maxwell and her ability to do so absent suggestion.\n\nWhen the prosecution offers testimony from an eyewitness to identify the defendant as a\nperpetrator of the offense, fundamental fairness requires that that identification testimony be\nreliable. Raheem v. Kelly, 257 F.3d l22, l33 (2d Cir. 2ool). The court must first determine\nwhether the pretrial identification procedures unduly and unnecessarily suggested that the\ndefendant was the perpetrator. If the court finds, houever, that the procedures were <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span>, it\nmust then determine whether the identification was nonetheless independently reliable. Jd.\n\nThe critical question here, ignored by the government, is not whether yy Anew\nthat she was accusing Ms. Maxwell in 2o2o (she undoubtably was) but whether she could\nidentify Ms. Maxwell as the person she was nou claiming abused her. Of the pictures selected\nhere, SG bad a high probability of picking Ms. Maxwell -- even then, she was\ntentative about one person who was not Ms. Maxwell. The shou up was neither confirmatory nor\nfair.\n\nThe protection against unduly <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> procedures encompass not only the right to\navoid improper police methods that suggest the initial identification, but as well the right to\navoid having <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> methods transform a selection that was only tentative into one that is\npositively certain. Solomon v. Smith, 645 F.2d ll79, ll85 (2d Cir. l98l).\n\nMs. Maxwell has met her burden of demonstrating the shou up was unduly <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span>.\nUnder these circumstances the Court should next consider the well knou “five factors”: (l) the\nwitness's opportunity to observe the criminal at the time of the crime, (2) the degree of the\nwitness's atention at that time, (3) the accuracy of the witness's initial description of the\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo692o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006921.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 4l of 52\ncriminal, (4) the certainty with which the witness first identified the suspect, and (5) the time\nlapse between the crime and the identification. /d. at ll86. Each of these factors weighs heavily\nin Ms. Maxwell’s favor: as to l-3, until 2o2o 3g had never claimed Ms. Maxwell\nparticipated in any abuse and never identified Ms. Maxwell -- indeed, she had never before been\nasked to identify Ms. Maxwell. Concerning number 4 J was less than certain, as\ndemonstrated by her selection of someone else who may have been “Ms. Maxwell.” Factor 5\nalso weighs in Ms. Maxwell’s favor, as the delay was l7 years.\n\nAccordingly, Ms. Maxwell requests that the Court hold an evidentiary hearing on this\nmotion and find that the shou up was unduly <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> and suppress any identification of Ms.\nMaxwell, before or during trial.\n\nVIH. GOVERNMENT AGREES NOT TO ELICIT LAW ENFORCEMENT\n\nOPINION TESTIMONY\n\nThe government agrees that it has not noticed any law enforcement officers as experts\nand, as to their fact police officers, \"will not elicit expert testimony from them.\" Resp. at 82-83.\nOverlooking the long list of potential law enforcement opinion testimony that has been\ndisalloued by Courts in the past (see Mot. at 2-5), the government then goes on to make the\nconfusing claim that the defense should have to \"provide expert\" testimony from the\ngovernment's oun case agents if it wants to call them as witnesses. Resp. at 83 n.24.\n\nThe defense has no intention of eliciting opinion testimony from the agents when they\ntestify. As the motion makes clear, the defense fully understands the contours of lay versus\nopinion testimony from law enforcement officers. The case agents are first hand percipient\nwitnesses to a number of facts in the investigation and prosecution of this case, including as the\nimpeachment witness for the many changed stories of the accusers.\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-oooo692l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007039.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 462 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 23 of 32\nJuror ID:\nIf no or unsure, please explain:\n| | NATURE OF CHARGES\n\n42.

In its brief, the defense seeks to\n2o affirmatively -- and I will quote from their brief -- \"call FBI\n2l case agents as witnesses\" to ask who they talked to, what\n22 documents they subpoenaed, and when. See, defense's response\n23 at 4o. But as the Second Circuit explained in Saldarriaga, the\n24 government's use or non-use of certain investigative techniques\n25 does not tend to shou the defendant's innocence of the charges.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o7l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007074.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 23 of l27 23\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl is the relevant basis for the jury's determination of guilt or\n2 innocence. Why and when the government conducted the\n\n3 investigation is not relevant. If the defense believes the\n\n4 government has a legally improper motive for prosecuting\n\n5 Ms. Maxwell or somehou fabricating evidence or suborning\n\n6 perjury or the like, the Second Circuit has made clear that the\n7 proper remedy is to file a motion for the Court to consider.\n\n8 See, Regan, lo3 F.3d lo82. Absent that, the law is clear that\n9 for purposes of the jury, \"the government is not on trial.\"\n\nlo United States v. Knox, 687 F.App'x 5l, (2d Cir. 2ol7).\n\nll Moreover, evidence of motive would be highly\n\nl2 prejudicial. For the reasons I explained a moment ago, it\n\nl3 would confuse jurors as to the proper standard of guilt to be\nl4 applied in the case. Indeed, the defense's outlined evidence\nl5 of improper motives is strongly <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> of jury\n\nl6 nullification because it suggests a vindictive or political\n\nl7 prosecution which is rightly a mater reserved to the Court.\n\nl8 Calling witnesses to testify to the government's\n\nl9 motive would substantially expand the scope of trial, rely\n2o likely on hearsay and other inadmissible evidence. So what\n2l motivated a particular investigative step or charging decision\n22 of course doesn't have a black or white answer, and the defense\n23 would have one story and the government another, neither of\n24 which would assist of the jury in deciding Ms. Maxwell's guilt\n25 or innocence of the charges here based on of the government's\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o74", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007151.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document465- Filed ll/l5/2l Page loo of l27 loo\nLBlTMAX3\n\nl the defense to engage in the full set of questions that counsel\n2 has indicated, but for purposes of the in limine motion, it's\n\n3 denied.\n\n4 Defense l9.

First, I must\n\nl4 determine whether the pretrial identification procedures were\nl5 unduly <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span>. Some examples of <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> procedures\n\nl6 include using a very small number of photographs, making\n\nl7 <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> comments, or the display of the accused in a way\n\nl8 that so stood out from all other photographs to suggest to an\nl9 identifying eyewitness that the person was more likely to be\n2o the culprit. See, United States v. Concepcion, 983 F.2d 369,\n2l (2d Cir. l992).\n22 Looking at the photo array, neither the photos used or\n23 the procedure itself was unduly <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span>. The array\n24 contained a sufficient number of photos larger than many arrays\n25 that courts have held were not unduly <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span>.

Alleged\n3 Victim-4 identified at least one other photo in the array that\n4 she thought could be Ms. Maxwell but she ultimately chose\n\n5 Ms. Maxwell's photo, and there were several photos in the array\n6 that were of roughly the same quality and angle as\n\n7 Ms. Maxwell's photo.\n\n8 The defense fails to identify any <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> comments\n9 made during the identification that would deem the procedures\nlo unduly <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span>. The government appears to have asked\n\nll whether the individual recognized anyone in the book. So I\n\nl2 conclude the identification procedure was not unduly\n\nl3 <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span>.\n\nl4 Even assuming the photo array was unduly <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span>,\nl5 the identification here had independent reliability factors I\nl6 must consider under the totality of circumstances that include\nl7 the opportunity of the witness to view the individual at the\n\nl8 time of the alleged crime, the witness's degree of atention,\nl9 the accuracy of the the witness's prior description of the\n2o individual, the level of uncertainty demonstrated, the length\n2l of time between the alleged crime and the confrontation. See,\n22 Neil v. Biggers, 4o9 U.S. l88, (l972).\n23 Here, the alleged Victim-4 had the opportunity to view\n24 Ms. Maxwell. They interacted several times over the span of\n25 years.

The government obviously thinks they\nare. And that’s fine. But it will be up to the jury to decide.\n\nOn the other hand, if the alleged “victims of sexual assaults . . . [were not] involved an\nongoing relationship of atachment and coercion with their abusers”—that is, if the victims are\nnot telling the truth—then according to the government Dr. Dietz’s opinions are unreliable. In\neither scenario, says the government, Dr. Dietz can’t testify. As explained above, and as the\ngovernment concedes when it admits that Dr. Dietz can testify about his disagreement with Dr.\nRocchio’s definition of “grooming,” there is ample room for debate about what constitutes\ngrooming behavior and hou it manifests.\n\nAccordingly, this Court should reject this “heads the government wins, tails Ms. Maxwell\nloses” argument.\n\nII.

Excepting one civil negligence claim based on exposure to sexual abuse, the cases\ncited by the government almost exclusively focus on reliability of eyewitness testimony or failed\nmemory regarding specific time or documents. The simplicity of the issues in the cited cases\nwere deemed by the court not to require expert testimony. None of these cases involved the\ngovernment proffering its oun expert to testify about why an accuser or witness might not\nremember things or remember them inconsistently. Moreover, the cases recognize that, in\ncircumstances like those present in this case, even absent a government “trauma/memory”\nwitness, defense expert testimony is appropriate. See, e.g., United States v. Heine, No. 3:l5-CR-\noo238-SI-2, 2ol7 WL 526o784, at *2 (D. Or. Nov. l3, 2ol7) (expert testimony regarding\nmemory would be alloued if the case involved issues of <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> questioning, drug use,\nhallucinations, or repressed or recovered memories).\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7485", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007496.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 3of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 2\ndescribed with confidence, detail, and emotion, just like true memories.

Each of these opinions\nderives from Dr. Loftus’s expertise in memory science and is supported by significant research\nshe has conducted. See Shiraishi, 2ol9 WL l386365, at *4. Additionally, the Court finds that\nopinions on <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> activities and creation of false memories are “beyond the knouledge of\nthe average juror.” Doe, 2ol8 WL lo64572, at *5 (collecting cases that admited expert\ntestimony on the effects of <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> questioning of alleged sexual abuse victims). Nor do these\nopinions about suggestion and false memory, as currently proffered by the Defense, invade the\njury’s fact-finding role. Much like Dr. Rocchio may inform jurors that victims of sexual assault\noften delay disclosure, Dr. Loftus may inform jurors that the literature indicates that false\naccusations can result from <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> activities or false memory creation.\n\nThe Court will, houever, limit or preclude altogether several of Dr. Loftus’s opinions.\nFirst, Dr. Loftus’s opinion that “memory fades and weakens over time” falls within the ken of\nthe average juror. Notice at l. “It is common knouledge that memory fades with time.” United\nStates v. Labansat, 94 F.3d 527, 53o (9th Cir. l996); see also United States v.

The Court would preclude such testimony on the specific facts of this case\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l87", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008188.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l6 Filed ll/2l/2l Pagel6ofl7\nbecause an expert witness may not “simply transmit . . . hearsay to the jury” or otherwise serve\nas a vehicle for the factual history of the case. United States v. Mejia, 545 F.3d l79, l97 (2d Cir.\n2oo8); see In re Fosamax, 645 F. Supp. 2d at l92. Testifying as to specific <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> activities\nwould also likely violate the rule against expert testimony on specific witnesses’ credibility.\nNimely, 4l4 F.3d at 398.\n\nBut in its response brief, the Defense states that “[l]ike Dr. Rocchio, [Dr. Loftus] would\nbe testifying as a ‘blind’ expert” and so will not testify about any particular witness in this case.\nDef.

The Defense may on cross-\nexamination ask witnesses about activities or events that the Defense believes led to false\nmemories. And the jury may then determine whether the general concepts in Dr. Loftus’s\nopinions are applicable to the evidence before it.\n\nLast, the Court clarifies that this decision as to Dr. Loftus is by no means an invitation for\nmemory experts to be admited in every future case. As other federal courts have observed,\nexpert testimony of this type is relevant only in unusual circumstances. See Carter, 4lo F.3d at\n95o; United States v. Redwood, 2l6 F. Supp. 3d 89o, 899 (N.D.

The Court finds this case to be one such unusual\ncircumstance, both because of the long period of time that has elapsed since the charged conduct\nand because of the public atention that conduct has received. Important, too, is that the Court\nhas admited the Government’s expert, Dr. Rocchio, who expects to testify on delayed disclosure\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l88", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008385.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 547 Filed l2/l5/2l Page l of 2\n2l2-243-lloo * Main 225 Broadway, Suite 7l5\n9l7-9l2-9698 * Cell New York, NY looo7\n888-587-4737 ° Fax besternhein@mac.com\n\nDecember l5, 2o2l\nHonorable Alison J.

Accusers were asked <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> questions during interviews and prep sessions with the\ngovernment. We anticipate that Agent Young will be testifying about the form of questions asked\nduring such interviews and prep sessions. A review of the 35oo material and Jane's testimony exemplify\nthe type of questioning the government posited during their investigation.\n\nBy way of example, during cross examination, Jane was asked about the government’s repeated\nquestioning regarding whether sexual abuse occurred in New Mexico, during two separate interviews\nand, during one of those interviews, three separate times. TR 5l2-5l6. Also, the government challenged\nJane’s recollection that she had seen The Lion King on Broadway during her first trip to New York at\nage l4, outright suggesting that she saw the movie instead. When Jane’s counsel confirmed that she had\nseen the Broadway shou, not the movie, AUSA Rossmiller told her lawyer that the government would\nJust “assume” that The Lion King trip was not her first trip to New York, even though that is what Jane\nhad reported to them. TR. 5o3-5ll; see 35o9-olo. True to form, at her very next call with the\ngovernment a few weeks later, she folloued their lead and “remembered” that the Lion King trip had not\nbeen her first trip to New York.

Dr. Rocchio testified, e.g., about \"parental\nfactors\" that have no foundation in the record of this case. She discussed “violence between parents,”\n\"the extent that the parents themselves have experienced any form of abuse in their oun backgrounds,”\nand the presence of a step-father in the home as all placing a child at a higher risk.

Absent that, the law is clear that\n9 for purposes of the jury, \"the government is not on trial.\"\n\nlo United States v. Knox, 687 F.App'x 5l, (2d Cir. 2ol7).\n\nll Moreover, evidence of motive would be highly\n\nl2 prejudicial. For the reasons I explained a moment ago, it\n\nl3 would confuse jurors as to the proper standard of guilt to be\nl4 applied in the case. Indeed, the defense's outlined evidence\nl5 of improper motives is strongly <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> of jury\n\nl6 nullification because it suggests a vindictive or political\n\nl7 prosecution which is rightly a mater reserved to the Court.\n\nl8 Calling witnesses to testify to the government's\n\nl9 motive would substantially expand the scope of trial, rely\n2o likely on hearsay and other inadmissible evidence. So what\n2l motivated a particular investigative step or charging decision\n22 of course doesn't have a black or white answer, and the defense\n23 would have one story and the government another, neither of\n24 which would assist of the jury in deciding Ms. Maxwell's guilt\n25 or innocence of the charges here based on of the government's\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo84o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009088.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6l3-l Filed o2/24/22 Page 2l of 3o\nJuror ID: ‘a QO\nAla.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this motion to preclude certain testimony of certain\ndefense witnesses. After reviewing the defendant’s witness list and related material, it appears\nthat certain witnesses are expected to testify about maters that are irrelevant, prejudicial, or\nimproper impeachment.\n\nSpecifically, the Government moves to preclude the follouing:\n\ne Testimony from Eva Dubin, Michelle Healy, or Kelly Bovino about whether they\n\nparticipated in a sexualized massage with Jane;\n\ne Testimony from Alexander Hamilton as contained in the affidavit atached as Exhibit\n\nAS\ne Testimony from Dr. Loftus about <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> activities that did not occur in this case;\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooll253", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011262.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o6 Filed o7/l2/22 Pageloofl2\nFT Just as extrinsic evidence on this point was improper during Kate’s cross, so it\nis Improper nou.\nee\nP| Hamilton’s rank speculation about Kate’s motives and intent are not probative\nof any issue in the case.\n\nThe remainder of the affidavit is simply background information about Hamilton and his\nrelationship with Kate. Accordingly, the affidavit reflects no admissible testimony that Hamilton\nmight offer, and he should be precluded from testifying to its contents.\n\nIV. The Court Should Preclude Testimony from Dr. Loftus That Does Not Fit the\n\nFacts of the Case\n\nThe Government understands that the Court has ruled that Dr. Loftus may testify and is not\nseeking to relitigate that issue. Houever, in reviewing transcripts of Dr. Loftus’s testimony in\nother trials, it appears that Dr. Loftus has testified about the <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> effects of (a) the use of\nleading questions by Government investigators and (b) pressure from therapists to provide more\ndetails about prior experiences (knoun as “response pressure”). Although it is unclear precisely\nwhat “<span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> activities” Dr. Loftus will discuss while on the stand, she should be precluded\nfrom any testimony about activities which do not fit the case.\n\nAs the Court has concluded, “one aspect of the Rule 7o2 and Daubert inquiry ls ‘fit,’ which\nasks ‘whether expert testimony proffered in the case is sufficiently tied to the facts of the case that it\nwill aid the jury in resolving a factual dispute.’” (ll/22/2l Mem. Op. & Order at 4). For an expert\nopinion to “fit,” the opinion must “assist the jury’s decision on a relevant question of fact... .”\n(/d.); see Fed. R. Evid. 7o2 advisory commitee notes (explaining that generalized testimony must\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooll262", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011263.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o6 Filed o7/l2/22 Pagellofl2\n“fit? the facts of the case”). “Expert evidence can be both pouerful and quite misleading because\nof the difficulty in evaluating it. Because of this risk, the judge in weighing possible prejudice\nagainst probative force under Rule 4o3 . . . exercises more control over experts than over lay\nwitnesses.” Daubert v. Merrell Dou Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 5o9 U.S. 579, 595 (l993) (internal\nquotation marks and citations omited).\n\nDr. Loftus has elsewhere testified that leading questions by the Government and response\npressure can create <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> memories. But at no time has the defendant elicited testimony from\nJane, Kate, Carolyn, or Annie that they were asked such questions or subject to such pressure.\nAccordingly, testimony from Dr. Loftus on that point does not fit the facts of the case and has no\nprobative value. It also would substantially prejudice the Government by suggesting to the jury—\nwithout evidence—that the Government or a therapist manufactured false memories in the Minor\nVictims. Dr. Loftus’s opinion on <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> activities therefore should not contain testimony\nabout Government questioning or response pressure exerted by therapists.\n\nV. The Court Should Preclude Testimony from John Lopez About Undisclosed\n\nExhibits\n\nFinally, the Court should preclude testimony from John Lopez about undisclosed exhibits.\nLopez is expected to testify about financial records in the case. Although the defendant sent a\nleter purporting to notice Lopez as an expert witness in an abundance of caution, the Government\nunderstands from conferring with the defense that the defendant does not plan to elicit expert\ntestimony from him.‘\n\n* The Government has also received no supplemental expert notice for Lopez. As the Government\nexplained in its motion to preclude expert testimony from Lopez, the original expert notice was\ninsufficient.\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooll263", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011716.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 74l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 5l of lo6 55\nLBTVMAX3 Opening —- Ms. Sternheim\n\nl be created through <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> activities, information, and\n\n2 influence; hou people can testify seemingly convincingly about\n3 false memories that they believe to be true, even when they are\n4 not.

The government argues that the above two opinions,\n3 houever, lack a foundation in the record. I'm going to deny\n\n4 the government's motion to preclude here, but with guidance.\n\niy First, as we've discussed and I've made clear, Dr.\n\n6 Loftus is testifying, I understand, as a blind expert, meaning\n7 that she'll provide relevant expert opinion, but not apply it\n\n8 to the facts of the case. And just as Dr. Rocchio offered\n\n9 testimony that included examples of grooming, variety of\n\nlo grooming examples or factors that might make a child vulnerable\nll to sexual abuse, it seems comparable to me that Dr. Loftus can\nl2 offer examples of <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> activity, including the two\n\nl3 examples the government seeks to exclude. So long as her\n\nl4 testimony does not state that those activities occurred in this\nl5 case or go into any specifics of the case, that would be beyond\nl6 the bounds of a blind expert.\n\nl7 Second, I think there is -- the defense has provided\nl8 an adequate foundation for expert opinion on <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span>\n\nl9 questioning by the government by cross-examining witnesses\n2o about the questions they were asked. For example, the defense\n2l on cross-examination of Jane asked about the government asking\n22 her the same question three times in the same interview, trial\n23 transcript at 5l5. And Jane testified that the government,\n24 quote, communicated to her through her atorney that The Lion\n25 King didn't come out until l997, which the defense also\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool3877", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00013878.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 76l _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page l9 of 246 23l4\nLCGVMAXl\n\nl believes to be an example of suggestion.

Post-event information can happen when two people are\n\n8 having a conversation with each other about the past and they\n\n9 can influence each other. Post-event information can be\n\nlo supplied when somebody is being interrogated, particularly, if\nll they're being interrogated with somebody who's got an agenda or\nl2 a hypothesis about what might have happened and communicates\n\nl3 that to the person they're interviewing, even inadvertently.\n\nl4 The media is a source of post-event suggestion that\n\nl5 we've actually studied where people are sometimes interviewed\nl6 on the media or media personalities will supply some <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span>\nl7 information that can contaminate memory.\n\nl8 Those are just examples of out there in the real\n\nl9 world, what are the opportunities for post-event suggestion to\n2o become available to a person and potentially contaminate a\n2l memory.\n22 Q. Have you conducted any studies or given any workshops with\n23 regards to interviewing techniques and the effect on memory?\n24 A. Well, that is typically what -- when I would be consulting,\n25 for example, with the FBI or the Secret Service or even the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool3985", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00013987.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 76l Filed o8/lo/22 Page l28 of 246 2423\nLCGCmax4 Loftus — direct\n\nl you've seen a horrible traffic accident or something\n\n2 particularly stressful happens to you.

Sometimes when people are trying to retrieve information,\nl3 there is pressure to provide more, more details, more details\nl4 about some particular subject.

Do you consult with patients in a therapeutic environment?\n22 A. I don't do therapy, but I sometimes study patients. I\n23 don't do therapy, though.\n24 Q.

That is particularly jarrmg given that she was charged with\nmultiple sex-trafficking offenses and two counts of perjury arising from civil depositions\non these very subjects. To be clear, we do not take issue with Mr. Blanche meeting with\nMs. Maxwell, seemimgly at Maxwell’s request, to obtain gratuitous information she wants\nto provide. Houever, for survivors who bravely testified, the perception that Ms. Maxwell\nis bemg legitimized in public discourse has already resulted im re-traumatization.\n\ne ‘Transfer to a Louer-Security Facility: Maxwell’s recent move to a louer-security prison\nhas further eroded the victims’ confidence that their safety and dignity are priorities. The\ntransfer was made without prior notice to the victims, without opportunity to object, and\nwithout explanation—actions they see as extraordinarily insensitive and <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> of\nulterior purposes.\n\ne Lack of Consultation on Unsealing: The government sought the unsealing of grand jury\nmaterials before this Court without first conferring with the victims or their counsel, a\nstep required by the CVRA and reinforced by Doe v. United States, o8-8o736 (S.D. Fla.).\nThat case, litigated pro bono by undersigned counsel for more than a decade, arose\nprecisely because the government previously violated the rights of many of these very\nsame victims. It is especially troubling that, despite the outcome of that litigation, the\ngovernment has once again proceeded m a manner that disregards the victums’ rights—\nsuggesting that the hard-learned lessons of the past have not taken hold. This omission\nreinforces the perception that the victims are, at best, an afterthought to the current\nadministration.\n\ne Concrete Fear of Clemency: Survivors are acutely concerned that unsealing, coupled with\nthe transfer and Ms. Maxwell’s public platform, may be a prelude to clemency. The risk\nof a pardon or commutation exacerbates safety concerns in derogation of § 377l (a)(l),\n\n; and threatens severe psychological harm, including triggering trauma responses.

See In re Craig, l3l\nF.3d at lo6 (where “the government supports a motion for disclosure, that should serve as a\npreliminary indication that the need for secrecy is not especially strong”). But the central\ninfirmity of this motion to unseal does not concern an ongoing need for secrecy in this case. The\ninfirmity is that, as the Government has conceded, the Maxwell grand jury materials do not\nreveal information outside the public domain.\n\nSecond, any argument that the Government’s motion to unseal merits substantial\ndeference is weakened by a host of irregularities with respect to that motion. That motion was\nnot made, nor has it been joined in, by any member of the Government’s trial team—the DOJ\nlawyers presumably most familiar with the Maxwell case and the broader Epstein-Maxwell\ninvestigation. The motion was filed by the DAG alone, without any signatory from the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office in this District. And it was made under circumstances <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> of haste\nrather than reflective deliberation. The motion was three-and-a-half pages in length; there were\nno supporting materials filed, under seal or otherwise; the motion did not disclose (or reflect\nawareness of) the summary-witness nature of the Maxwell grand jury testimony; and the motion\nwas made without advance notice to Epstein’s and Maxwell’s victims, a fact which, as reviewed\nbelou, has alarmed numerous victims. Only after the Court inquired on that point was notice to\nvictims given. See Dkt. 789; Dkt. 796 at 9. Finally, the Government’s highlighting of the grand\njury transcripts did not suggest close familiarity with the Maxwell trial record, because a number\nof details that it identified as non-public in fact had been testified to during the trial.

The government argues that the above two opinions,\n3 houever, lack a foundation in the record. I'm going to deny\n\n4 the government's motion to preclude here, but with guidance.\n\niy First, as we've discussed and I've made clear, Dr.\n\n6 Loftus is testifying, I understand, as a blind expert, meaning\n7 that she'll provide relevant expert opinion, but not apply it\n\n8 to the facts of the case. And just as Dr. Rocchio offered\n\n9 testimony that included examples of grooming, variety of\n\nlo grooming examples or factors that might make a child vulnerable\nll to sexual abuse, it seems comparable to me that Dr. Loftus can\nl2 offer examples of <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> activity, including the two\n\nl3 examples the government seeks to exclude. So long as her\n\nl4 testimony does not state that those activities occurred in this\nl5 case or go into any specifics of the case, that would be beyond\nl6 the bounds of a blind expert.\n\nl7 Second, I think there is -- the defense has provided\nl8 an adequate foundation for expert opinion on <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span>\n\nl9 questioning by the government by cross-examining witnesses\n2o about the questions they were asked. For example, the defense\n2l on cross-examination of Jane asked about the government asking\n22 her the same question three times in the same interview, trial\n23 transcript at 5l5. And Jane testified that the government,\n24 quote, communicated to her through her atorney that The Lion\n25 King didn't come out until l997, which the defense also\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool65ol", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016502.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 76l _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page l9 of 246 23l4\nLCGVMAXl\n\nl believes to be an example of suggestion. This testimony\n\n2 provides a sufficient basis for the jury to consider the\n\n3 relevance of Dr. Loftus's opinions on <span class=\"highlight\">suggestive</span> questioning\n\n4 techniques. So that's my basis for that ruling.\n\nS There was argument regarding Agent Young testimony\n\n6 that -- I don't knou the government's general views on Agent\n\n7 Young's testimony and I don't need to reach a conclusion on\n\n8 that for purposes of this ruling.

Have you conducted any studies or given any workshops with\n23 regards to interviewing techniques and the effect on memory?\n24 A.
