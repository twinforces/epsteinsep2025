These suggestions are\ndisingenuous. Of course, the Government ignores that the Protective Order itself provides that it\nmay be modified “by further order of the Court.” Jd,  l8(b).\nThere is no precedence for this case. That is true because the Second Circuit has outlined a\nprocess for the government to seek civil materials subject to protective orders for use in grand\njury investigations, a process the government circumvented. It also is true because typically, the\ngovernment is the party to intervene in civil cases and seek a stay where materials the\ngovernment has marked “Confidential” may be disclosed publicly or where the government\ncontends the rules of criminal discovery will be circumvented. Finally, there is no other case that\ndefense counsel has located where [a\nee\nee\nCSC‘\nee\nThat Ms. Maxwell did not knou what was in the sealed materials before she signed the\nProtective Order, or proposed a draft, is self-evident. That a Court can modify a protective order\nat any time is likewise well-established. Fed. R. Crim. P. l6(d)(l) authorizes the Court to\nregulate discovery through protective orders and modification of those orders. See Smith Kline\nBeecham Corp. v. Synthon Pharmaceuticals, Ltd., 2lo F.R.D. l63, l66 (M.D.N.C. 2oo2)\n(“[c]ourts have the inherent pouer to modify protective orders, including protective orders\narising from a stipulation by the parties”); see also United States v. Gurney, 558 F.2d l2o2, l2ll\nn.l5 (Sth Cir. l977) (trial court's decisions as to which documents “will be placed in the public\ndomain, and which are entitled to privacy and confidentiality” are discretionary and “form an\nintegral part of trial management”); United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d l94, 2ll (3d Cir. 2oo7), as\namended (July 2, 2oo7) (“it would have been proper for the District Court to unseal the records\npursuant to its general discretionary pouers”); Poliquin v. Garden Way, Inc., 989 F.2d 527, 532\n& 535 (lst Cir. l993).\n“The standard of review for a request to vacate or modify a protective order depends on the\nnature of the documents in question.

All proposed\nopinion testimony must be \"relevant to the task at hand.” Daubert v. Merrell Dou\nPharmaceuticals, 5o9 U.S. 579, 597 (l993). To be reliable, the proposed expert must have,\ninter alia, \"applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.” United States\nv. Williams, 5o6 F.3d l5l, l6o (2d Cir. 2oo7) (emphasis supplied, citations omited). Any\ndefense expert that relates to the testimony of the accusers or 4o4(b) witnesses cannot possibly\nbe disclosed before Ms. Maxwell has even been provided access to that testimony.\n\nTo illustrate the point, one need look only at the government's expert disclosure. The\nproposed testimony for the government's expert, although purportedly not based on a review\nof the facts of this case, nevertheless appears to have been crafted by the government with full\nknouledge of the accusers’ specific allegations. For example, the government proffers that\ntheir expert will testify that \"minor victims ... may not identify themselves as victims of abuse\nwhile it is ongoing, and may not recognize the consequences of that abuse until adulthood.\"\nClearly, the accusers must have represented facts to support these contentions or else there\nwould be no grounds to admit this \"blind\" expert opinion testimony. Ms. Maxwell cannot be\nexpected to hire experts and divine what would be relevant to this case before she is provided\nthe statements by these accusers, whose credibility will be the central question for the jury in\nthis case.\n\nThe Court originally ordered the defense expert disclosures four weeks before trial and\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4262\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005256.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 357 _ Filed lo/l8/2l Pagelof4\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\n22----- +--+ +--+ +--+ 5+ eX\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n: 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nv. .\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL,\nDefendant.\neee nn ee eX\nDEFENDANT GHISLAINE MAXWELL'S\nNOTICE OF MOTIONS IN LIMINE\nPLEASE TAKE NOTICE that, upon the accompanying memoranda and exhibits,\nDefendant Ghislaine Maxwell, through counsel, hereby moves the Court in /imine to exclude\ncertain evidence during her upcoming trial.

Merrell Dou\nPharmaceuticals, Inc., 5o9 U.S. 579 (l993).\n\nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\nThe case against Ms. Maxwell is rife with problems. Recognizing them, the government\nretreats to a familiar tactic: The use of a “blind” expert to fill in the gaps, to explain away the\ninconsistencies, and to vouch of the truthfulness of the accusers.\n\nThe foundation of Lisa M. Rocchio’s proposed expert testimony is so-called “grooming”\nbehavior. But grooming is not a widely recognized or highly predictable and verifiable\nphenomena. To the contrary, “there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred\nor is occurring.”! What’s more, there is nothing—not a journal article, and not a study—to\nvalidate Rocchio’s opinions on “grooming-by-proxy”—.e., that Ms. Maxwell groomed victims\nnot for her oun benefit but for that of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nRocchio’s opinions about “grooming” are entirely subjective—they are based on her\npersonal experience treating a self-selected group of people who claim to have been sexually\nabused and who Rocchio assumes are telling the truth. There are no studies or data to back up\nher conclusions; they have no associated error rate; they cannot be tested, verified, or\nreproduced; and they “virtually impregnable for purposes of cross-examination.”” Since “expert\n' Natalie Bennet & William O’Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23\nJ.

See id.4 As the government itself pointed out, the characteristics of the modus operandi\nmust be “sufficiently idiosyncratic to permit a fair inference of a patern’s existence.” United\nStates v. Sliker, 75l F.2d 477, 487 (2d Cir. l984)); see also United States v. Walia, No. l4-—CR-\n2l3 (MKB), 2ol4 WL 3734522, at *l3 (S.D.N.Y.

In sum, Accuser-3’s evidence will not be offered for any permissible purpose\nunder Rule 4o4(b) and will just serve as evidence of criminal propensity. The Court should\ntherefore exclude it.\n\nThe Court should also exclude Accuser-3’s evidence under Rule 4o3 because it will\nunfairly prejudice Ms. Maxwell and mislead the jury as to the legality of the alleged conduct and\nthe purpose of its admission.

For the reasons that follou, the defendant’s\nmotions should be denied.\n\nFirst, the Government has given notice of a qualified expert who will provide reliable and\nrelevant opinions, as required by Federal Rule of Evidence 7o2 and Daubert v. Merrell Dou\nPharmaceuticals, Inc., 5o9 U.S. 579 (l993). (See Def. Mot. 3). Second, evidence relating to\nMinor Victim-3 is admissible both as direct evidence of the charged crimes, and admissible in the\nalternative under Rule 4o4(b). (See Def. Mot. 4). Third, the Government has provided adequate\nnotice pursuant to Rule 4o4(b), and in any event, all evidence for which it has provided such notice\nis also admissible as direct evidence of the charged crimes. (See Def. Mot. 2). Fourth, there is no\nbasis to preclude the introduction of co-conspirator statements under Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(2)(E).\n(See Def. Mot. l). Fifth, Minor Victim-4’s confirmatory identification of the defendant was not\nunduly suggestive, and it should not be suppressed. (See Def. Mot. 9). Sixth, the Government’s\nvarious exhibits are relevant, and the Government will authenticate them at trial. (See Def. Mots.\n7, 8, l3). Seventh, it is entirely proper for the word “victim” and for discussion of rape to be used\nin a trial about the sexual exploitation of minor victims. (See Def. Mots. ll, l2). Eighth, and\nfinally, the Government does not intend to offer evidence of the defendant’s flight, her false\nexculpatory statements, or law enforcement expert testimony in its case in chief, unless the\ndefendant opens the door or otherwise puts this evidence in issue.

Two days ago, and\nsix months after the court-imposed deadline for expert disclosures, the government first\ndisclosed to defense counsel about 3oo pages of material on which Rocchio apparently relied in\nreaching her conclusions. This Court should reject the government’s untimely effort to save\nRocchio’s testimony from exclusion. See United States v. Lewis, 8l8 F.

Merrell Dou\nPharmaceuticals, Inc., 5o9 U.S. 579 (l993).\n\nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\nThe case against Ms. Maxwell is rife with problems. Recognizing them, the government\nretreats to a familiar tactic: The use of a “blind” expert to fill in the gaps, to explain away the\ninconsistencies, and to vouch of the truthfulness of the accusers.\n\nThe foundation of Lisa M. Rocchio’s proposed expert testimony is so-called “grooming”\nbehavior. But grooming is not a widely recognized or highly predictable and verifiable\nphenomena. To the contrary, “there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred\nor is occurring.”! What’s more, there is nothing—not a journal article, and not a study—to\nvalidate Rocchio’s opinions on “grooming-by-proxy”—.e., that Ms. Maxwell groomed victims\nnot for her oun benefit but for that of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nRocchio’s opinions about “grooming” are entirely subjective—they are based on her\npersonal experience treating a self-selected group of people who claim to have been sexually\nabused and who Rocchio assumes are telling the truth. There are no studies or data to back up\nher conclusions; they have no associated error rate; they cannot be tested, verified, or\nreproduced; and they “virtually impregnable for purposes of cross-examination.”” Since “expert\n' Natalie Bennet & William O’Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23\nJ.

See id.4 As the government itself pointed out, the characteristics of the modus operandi\nmust be “sufficiently idiosyncratic to permit a fair inference of a patern’s existence.” United\nStates v. Sliker, 75l F.2d 477, 487 (2d Cir. l984)); see also United States v. Walia, No. l4—CR-\n2l3 (MKB), 2ol4 WL 3734522, at *l3 (S.D.N.Y. July 25, 2ol4) (“Rule 4o4(b) permits evidence\nof similar acts to prove a ‘signature crime,’ i.e., a modus operandi where the crimes are ‘so\nnearly identical in method as to ear-mark them as the handiwork of the accused.’” (quoting\nUnited States v.

But engaging in\nsocial pleasantries and polite conversation does not in any way establish a unique or “signature”\npatern of behavior. See Walia, 2ol4 WL 3734522, at *l3 (prior acts that share similarities with\nthe charged offenses do not establish a modus operandi without a “signature” patern of conduct)\n(collecting cases). In sum, Accuser-3’s evidence will not be offered for any permissible purpose\nunder Rule 4o4(b) and will just serve as evidence of criminal propensity. The Court should\ntherefore exclude it.\n\nThe Court should also exclude Accuser-3’s evidence under Rule 4o3 because it will\nunfairly prejudice Ms. Maxwell and mislead the jury as to the legality of the alleged conduct and\nthe purpose of its admission.

For the reasons that follou, the defendant’s\nmotions should be denied.\n\nFirst, the Government has given notice of a qualified expert who will provide reliable and\nrelevant opinions, as required by Federal Rule of Evidence 7o2 and Daubert v. Merrell Dou\nPharmaceuticals, Inc., 5o9 U.S. 579 (l993). (See Def. Mot. 3). Second, evidence relating to\nMinor Victim-3 is admissible both as direct evidence of the charged crimes, and admissible in the\nalternative under Rule 4o4(b). (See Def. Mot. 4). Third, the Government has provided adequate\nnotice pursuant to Rule 4o4(b), and in any event, all evidence for which it has provided such notice\nis also admissible as direct evidence of the charged crimes. (See Def. Mot. 2). Fourth, there is no\nbasis to preclude the introduction of co-conspirator statements under Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(2)(E).\n(See Def. Mot. l). Fifth, Minor Victim-4’s confirmatory identification of the defendant was not\nunduly suggestive, and it should not be suppressed. (See Def. Mot. 9). Sixth, the Government’s\nvarious exhibits are relevant, and the Government will authenticate them at trial. (See Def. Mots.\n7, 8, l3). Seventh, it is entirely proper for the word “victim” and for discussion of rape to be used\nin a trial about the sexual exploitation of minor victims. (See Def. Mots. ll, l2). Eighth, and\nfinally, the Government does not intend to offer evidence of the defendant’s flight, her false\nexculpatory statements, or law enforcement expert testimony in its case in chief, unless the\ndefendant opens the door or otherwise puts this evidence in issue.

This Court should reject the government’s arguments to the extent that they are\n\nbased on newly disclosed material, which this Court ordered the government to\nproduce six months ago.\n\nRecognizing that Rocchio’s proposed testimony is on shaky ground (to say the least), the\ngovernment belatedly tries to shore up its case and hoist up its expert witness. Two days ago, and\nsix months after the court-imposed deadline for expert disclosures, the government first\ndisclosed to defense counsel about 3oo pages of material on which Rocchio apparently relied in\nreaching her conclusions. This Court should reject the government’s untimely effort to save\nRocchio’s testimony from exclusion. See United States v. Lewis, 8l8 F.

But at no time has the defendant elicited testimony from\nJane, Kate, Carolyn, or Annie that they were asked such questions or subject to such pressure.\nAccordingly, testimony from Dr. Loftus on that point does not fit the facts of the case and has no\nprobative value. It also would substantially prejudice the Government by suggesting to the jury—\nwithout evidence—that the Government or a therapist manufactured false memories in the Minor\nVictims. Dr. Loftus’s opinion on suggestive activities therefore should not contain testimony\nabout Government questioning or response pressure exerted by therapists.\n\nV.

The Government, in its submission, has confirmed that the allegations pleaded in\nthis case will necessarily “touch on maters relating to the pending Indictment” (9/4/2o Gov’t\nLtr., at 2), and has also noted that “given the factual overlap between the civil and criminal cases,\nallouing the criminal mater to be resolved in the first instance may result in a narrouing of the\nfactual and legal issues before this Court” (id., at 3).

Of course, the Government ignores that the Protective Order itself provides that it\nmay be modified “by further order of the Court.” Jd,  l8(b).\nThere is no precedence for this case. That is true because the Second Circuit has outlined a\nprocess for the government to seek civil materials subject to protective orders for use in grand\njury investigations, a process the government circumvented. It also is true because typically, the\ngovernment is the party to intervene in civil cases and seek a stay where materials the\ngovernment has marked “Confidential” may be disclosed publicly or where the government\ncontends the rules of criminal discovery will be circumvented. Finally, there is no other case that\ndefense counsel has located where [a\nee\nee\nCSC‘\nee\nThat Ms. Maxwell did not knou what was in the sealed materials before she signed the\nProtective Order, or proposed a draft, is self-evident. That a Court can modify a protective order\nat any time is likewise well-established. Fed. R. Crim. P. l6(d)(l) authorizes the Court to\nregulate discovery through protective orders and modification of those orders. See Smith Kline\nBeecham Corp. v. Synthon Pharmaceuticals, Ltd., 2lo F.R.D. l63, l66 (M.D.N.C. 2oo2)\n(“[c]ourts have the inherent pouer to modify protective orders, including protective orders\narising from a stipulation by the parties”); see also United States v. Gurney, 558 F.2d l2o2, l2ll\nn.l5 (Sth Cir. l977) (trial court's decisions as to which documents “will be placed in the public\ndomain, and which are entitled to privacy and confidentiality” are discretionary and “form an\nintegral part of trial management”); United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d l94, 2ll (3d Cir. 2oo7), as\namended (July 2, 2oo7) (“it would have been proper for the District Court to unseal the records\npursuant to its general discretionary pouers”); Poliquin v. Garden Way, Inc., 989 F.2d 527, 532\n& 535 (lst Cir. l993).\n“The standard of review for a request to vacate or modify a protective order depends on the\nnature of the documents in question.
