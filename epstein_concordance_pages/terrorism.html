With regard to the\nnature and circumstances of the offenses charged, they are extremely serious and involve Mr.\nRobertson allegedly shooting a victim, D.S., in retaliation for his cooperation with the government\nin an earlier criminal case. As the Court stated at the November 4, 2o2l pretrial conference, it\ntakes Mr. Robertson’s charges extremely seriously because the ability of witnesses to come\nforward and safely provide information to the government, and to the Court, is at the core of our\ncriminal justice system.\n\nWith regard to the weight of the evidence against Mr. Robertson, it is mixed. On the one\nhand, D.S. positively identified Mr. Robertson as the person who shot him and at least one other\nwitness, N.F., has testified that Mr. Robertson made incriminating statements in the weeks prior\nto the shooting. On the other hand, it appears that there were many people present at the time and\nplace of the shooting and there is evidence that D.S.’s identification of Mr. Robertson could have\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- ooool298", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001438.jpg": "Casest:2o-cr/ooBaG AGA B6eumMeEnt 2222 FiledOos/O7/PagPage fof 3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

As to the question in Peters and Peters’ instructions, namely whether a person who absconded from US\ncriminal proceeding in breach of bail would be likely to be granted bail in any subsequent UK extradition\nproceedings, such a person is extremely unlikely to be granted bail. While every bail application falls to\nbe considered by reference to all the circumstances that are relevant at the time that the application is\nmade, in practice evidence of both a clear desire to evade prosecution for the offences in the extradition\nrequest, and a previous history of failure to comply with bail conditions, would militate strongly against\nthe grant of bail in almost all factual circumstances.\n\nD.

See, e.g., United States v.

The Court should not apply them here.\n\nInstead, the Court should follou the Third Circuit’s approach in United States v. Gebbie,\n294 F.3d 54o (3™ Cir. 2oo2), which involved a situation like this one where the charges in the\nsecond prosecution were identical to the dismissed charges. In Gebbie, the defendants were\ncharged in a multi-count indictment in the Southern District of Ohio charging them with various\noffenses related to a scheme to make false statements to the U.S. Postal Service. 294 F.3d at\n542. As part of their plea agreement, the defendants pled guilty to misprision of a felony in\nexchange for dismissal of the counts in the indictment. /d. at 543. The plea agreement further\nprovided that the agreement did not protect the defendants from prosecution for “other crimes or\noffenses” which “the United States” discovers by independent investigation. /d. at 545-46. A\nfew months after entering their plea, the defendants were charged in the Western District of\nPennsylvania with “the same crimes and offenses that were at issue” in the Ohio prosecution. /d.\nat 546 (emphasis in original). Because the plea agreement barred “the United States” from\nprosecuting the defendants for the same crimes covered by the agreement, the question for the\nCourt was: “who is bound when a plea agreement refers to ‘the United States’ or ‘the\nGovernment’?” /d.

Except for programs that she\ncompleted but could never put to use in isolation, she was not permited to participate in general\nprogramming (educational, leisure and wellness), to view movies, or to receive job assignment.\nWhen she first arrived in the MDC, she was handcuffed while seated in a chair watching television.\nDuring the first three months of detention, she was only alloued two l5-minute phone calls per\nmonth, further limiting contact with her family, most especially with her husband and stepchildren.\nThis is the same restriction that was applied in MCC’s lo South, the super-secure\nspecial/segregated housing unit (“SHU”) for inmates charged with <span class=\"highlight\">terrorism</span> offenses. A further\nchill was placed on her phone use when recordings of her calls were improperly released by the\nMDC to a third party. To forestall further disruption of the privacy of her family, she curtailed\nsocial use of the phone, further limiting contact with the outside.\n\nMs. Maxwell was denied adequate nutrition. She was provided meager, stale, often rancid\nand inedible meals in violation of her non-flesh diet and in packaging that melted when heated in\na microuave. At times she was not provided food for prolonged periods or was given meals\nmissing components. She was denied access to basic hygiene items, e.g., soap, toothbrush,\ntoothpaste, and provided only a limited amount of toilet paper. For more than a year, she brushed\nher teeth with an inch-long finger implement until given a normal toothbrush, that was never\nreplaced. Her commissary list was restricted, and she was not permited to order items available\nto other inmates.'> When the tap water in her isolation cell was foul-smelling and undrinkable,\nrequests for botled water were initially rejected by the prison administration. As a result of being\nprovided an inadequate diet, Ms. Maxwell has lost about 2o pounds and suffered from telogen\n'S Even in general population, her commissary is more restricted than other inmates.

Accordingly, it is appropriate to make a sentencing submission that exposes the\nunfairness of her detention in the hope that the government (e.g., DOJ, BOP, and prosecutors) not repeat\nsuch disparate treatment and courts recognize that it cannot abandon its supervisory pouers to permit BOP\nbureaucrats to exercise administrative measures without accountability.\n\n* “Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments\ninflicted.” U.S. Const. amend xi.\n“USSG, Part A, §§ 2-5 (2o2l).\n*> See Solem v.

The most basic objective is to “combat crime through an effective, fair sentencing\nsystem” through (i) honesty in sentencing (that is, removing the pouer of the parole commission to reduce\nthe term to be served); (ll) reasonable uniformity in sentencing - by reducing the wide disparity of sentences\nfor similar offenses; and (i) proportionate sentences.

Mr. Robertson has met his burden of production and has rebuted the presumption\nin § 3l42(e)(3)(B) that no condition or combination of conditions could meet the requirements for\nhis release.\n\nSection 3l42(g) then lays out the follouing factors for courts to consider: (l) the nature\nand circumstances of the offense charged, including whether the offense is a crime of violence, a\nviolation of § l59l, a Federal crime of <span class=\"highlight\">terrorism</span>, or involves a minor victim or a controlled\nsubstance, firearm, explosive, or destructive device; (2) the weight of the evidence against the\ndefendant; (3) the history and characteristics of the defendant; and (4) the nature and seriousness\nof the danger to any person or community that would be posed by the defendant’s release. l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nThe Court finds that although some of these factors weigh against Mr. Robertson’s release,\nthey do not foreclose relief under the strict conditions the Court has imposed.

On the one\nhand, D.S. positively identified Mr. Robertson as the person who shot him and at least one other\nwitness, N.F., has testified that Mr. Robertson made incriminating statements in the weeks prior\nto the shooting.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOnce again, the government reports second- and third-hand information from the MDC,\nthe reliability of which becomes increasingly questionable. In its May 5\" leter regarding the\nMDC’s flashlight security checks of Ms. Maxwell (Dkt. 27o), the government contradicts a\nprevious report that Ms. Maxwell “has an eye mask.” This allegation, immediately refuted by her\ncounsel, was a focus of the Second Circuit’s questioning during oral argument of Ms. Maxwell’s\nbail appeal. Nou, the government reports that the MDC cannot provide an eye mask to Ms.\nMaxwell and that an eye mask is considered contraband. This alone is a basis for the Court to\nquestion the veracity of representations made by the MDC.\n\nTo justify the l5-minute flashlight surveillance that is causing Ms. Maxwell’s disruptive\nsleep and sleep deprivation, the MDC claims that Ms. Maxwell is on “an enhanced security\nschedule.” The reasons given to support the need for “heightened safety and security concerns”\nwith respect to Ms. Maxwell are spurious. They single out Ms. Maxwell to the detriment of\nother pretrial detainees who face even more serious charges and potential stress (i.e., defendants\ncharged with murder and <span class=\"highlight\">terrorism</span> offenses subjected to life sentences without possibility of\nrelease and the death penalty) and who are incarcerated in cells by themselves. The MDC\natempts to shift the focus of its conduct by claiming that it is responsive to Ms. Maxwell’s\n“expressed concern for her safety if she were housed in general population.”\n\nThe MDC should fact check its records before making bold assertions. The Intake\nScreening Form completed by Ms. Maxwell upon entry to the MDC on July 6, 2o2o posed the\nfollouing question: “Do you knou of any reason why you should not be placed in general\npopulation?” Ms. Maxwell responded “No.” It is the MDC, not the inmate, who makes the\ndetermination regarding general population or degree of segregation. The Intake Screening\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2o356", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021109.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page62 of ll3\nalternative holding — “[a] further ground for [its] conclusion” —that, even in\ncases where “fraud” occurs, a categorical analysis precludes extending the WSLA\nto prosecutions for making false statements. /d. at 22l-22. And in applying this\ncategorical approach, Bridges looked, not to the legislative history of the WSLA,\nbut to Scharton and Noveck (which involved a different statute). See Bridges, 346\nUSS. at 222 (citing, inter alia, Scharton and Noveck).\n\nHere, Bridges, Scharton, and Noveck point the way. Because § 3283\nemploys the same “offense-involving” language as the statutes analyzed in those\ncases, compare l8 U.S.C. § 3283 with id. § 3287; 26 U.S.C. § 653l, a similar\ninterpretation should govern. See Smith v. City of Jackson, Miss., 544 U.S. 228,\n233 (2oo5); Wasser v. New York State Off, of Vocational & Educational Servs.,\n6o2 F.3d 476, 48o (2d Cir. 2olo). The Court should apply a categorical approach\nand hold that § 3283 did not modify the statute of limitations for § 2423(a)\nviolations.\n\nNothing in the text of § 3283 indicates a contrary result. Indeed, Congress\nhas shoun that when it wants to tether a statute of limitations to conduct occurring\nin a particular case, it knous hou to do so—and uses unambiguous wording\ndistinct from § 3283. Notably, in 2ool, Congress eliminated the statute of\nlimitations for certain <span class=\"highlight\">terrorism</span> offenses in which “the commission of such offense\nresulted in, or created a foreseeable risk of, death or serious bodily injury to\n\n47\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2llo9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00029698.jpg": "Birth Certificate & Death Certificates Location, Palm Beach County Health Department Page l of 3\nc * |\nway Palm Reach County ! ,\nHEALTH) MIEALTH DEPARTMENT  , |\nMENU : 7 Pi :\nOffice of Vital\n[Home] — :\nfAbout Us] Statistics —_ ,\n[Health Centers] (Birth & Death Certificate |\n[Directory] Requests) - |\n, {Health Services] |\n[WIC Services] Palm Beach County Health . b6 -3\n[Environmental] Department BIE =2\n[Birth & Death Office of Vital Statistics b3 -l |\nRecords] ll5o 45th Street of3 |\n[Immunizations] West Palm Beach, FL. 334o7 !\n[Education] (56l) 5l4-532o |\n[Forms] |\n[Publications] , }\n[Medical Residency]\n[Be_a Volunteer] a evan !\n[Press Release] | amieel a |\n[Contact Us] Cae welut, Ga et |\n[What's New] pap Pes | |\nPBCHD Crganizational Mer ooo” Ee .\nChart (pan oe ne acacia ae . a\nOTHER LINKS a\n> MAPGV ES Tr — om:\nLinks lol | a| Osmrestooure . |\n| a s .
