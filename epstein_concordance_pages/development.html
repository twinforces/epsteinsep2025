No. l92), and pursuant to the Court’s Order dated April 2, 2o2l (Dkt. No.\nl93). As set forth belou, the timing of superseding indictment S2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN) (the “S2\nIndictment”) was dictated by developments in the Government’s ongoing investigation, not the\nnefarious motivations suggested by the defense. Although trial may be modestly longer as a result,\nthe S2 Indictment by no means opens the floodgate of witnesses the defense imagines; to the\ncontrary, the Government expects to present a streamlined case focusing primarily on the four\nminor victims referenced in the S2 Indictment. Moreover, the Government has already taken, and\nwill continue to take, steps to ensure that the defense will be fully prepared for trial as scheduled\nin July. Accordingly, the Government would oppose any request for an adjournment of trial.\nFinally, the addition of new charges, supported by even more evidence, in no way warrants\nreconsideration of this Court’s three prior orders denying the defendant bail.\n\nFirst, the Government obtained the S2 Indictment based on new evidence that was not\navailable to it at the time the defendant was indicted in 2o2o or at the time Jeffrey Epstein was\nindicted in 2ol9. Specifically, although Minor Victim-4 had previously been interviewed once in\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo29l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003082.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l48 of 239\nnatural meaning in the context in which words were used they were materially untrue, perjury was\nestablished.” United States v. Bonacorsa, 528 F.2d l2l8, l22l (2d Cir. l976). Critically, and as\nnoted with respect to Lighte above, courts generally evaluate whether a challenge to a perjury\ncount on the basis that a question was fundamentally ambiguous after trial and follouing the\n<span class=\"highlight\">development</span> of a full factual record. See, e.g., Strohm, 67l at ll75 (appeal follouing conviction);\nSarwari, 669 F.3d at 4o6 (same); Farmer, l37 F.3d at l269 (appeal follouing conviction and\npartial Rule 29 dismissal) Markiewicz, 978 F.2d at 8o8 (appeal follouing conviction); cf’ United\nStates v. Forde, 74o F. Supp. 2d 4o6, 4l3 (S.D.N.Y. 2olo) (denying a motion to dismiss a perjury\ncount). Indeed, the defendant cites no case in which a court has dismissed a perjury count on the\nbasis of “fundamental ambiguity” before trial.\n\nBecause perjury requires a knouing false statement, the law does not permit conviction\nbased on answers that are literally true. See Lighte, 782 F.2d at 374. Nor can a conviction rest on\nanswers that are literally true but unresponsive, and therefore “arguably misleading by negative\nimplication.” /d.; see Bronston v. United States, 4o9 U.S. 352, 362 (l973). But when “the answer\nis false, the fact that it is unresponsive is immaterial.” United States v. Corr, 543 F.2d lo42, lo49\n(2d Cir. l976). Even statements that “could be literally true in isolation” can support a perjury\nconviction if they are “materially untrue” in “the context in which the statements were made.”\nUnited States v. Schafrick, 87l F.2d 3oo, 3o4 (2d Cir. l989). “[U]nless the questioning is\nfundamentally ambiguous or imprecise, the truthfulness of [the defendant’s] answers is an issue\nfor the jury.” Jd. at 3o4; see United States v.

The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the <span class=\"highlight\">development</span>, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\n\nIx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l87\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003190.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4 of 348\nthat the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the\nDepartment.\n\nVI. ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the <span class=\"highlight\">development</span> and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l9o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003199.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23 of 348\nA.

The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both\nthe larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of\nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this resolution. Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the\nfacts surrounding the <span class=\"highlight\">development</span> of the two-year state plea resolution or the NPA.\n\nIn the follouing account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous\ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR\nquestioned each of the subjects about hou the decision was reached to pursue a state resolution,\nand OPR includes belou the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA. June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”>° In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could\n» State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw enforcement and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities. The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry\nis administered by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n56 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3238\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003245.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 69 of 348\non the defense team believes that the federal investigation in this\nmater has been for shou.\n\nNor are your arguments that I have violated the Ashcroft memo, the\nUSAM or any other policy well taken.

If you\nwant to work major cases in the district you must understand and\naccept the fact that there is a chain of command — something you\ndisregard with great regularity.\n\nVillafafia acknouledged to OPR that as Criminal Division Chief, Menchel had authority to\ndeviate from the Ashcroft Memo requiring that guilty pleas be to the most serious readily provable\noffense. She disagreed, houever, with his representation about her initial meeting with Acosta\nand Sloman regarding the Epstein investigation, noting that Menchel had not been at that\nmeeting. Villafafia told OPR that no one had communicated to her the “concerns” Menchel\nmentioned, and she had not been given an opportunity to respond to those concerns.”\n\nA week later, Villafafia replied to Menchel’s email, reiterating her concerns about the\nprocess and that filing charges against Epstein was not moving forward:\n\nHi Mat -- My trial is over, so I nou have [ ] time to focus back on\n\nthis case and our e-mail exchange. There are several points in your\n6? Neither Menchel nor Villafafia could recall for OPR to what concerns they were referring. In commenting\non OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney noted that Acosta’s concerns were “the possibility that bringing a case with\nserious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal issues could result in an outcome that set back the <span class=\"highlight\">development</span> of\ntrafficking laws and result in an aggregate greater harm to trafficking victims.”\nob Menchel confirmed to OPR that he was not involved in the decision to initiate the federal investigation.\n69 Villafafia characterized Menchel’s email as “meant to intimidate” and told OPR that she felt “put in [her]\nplace” by him. She perceived that Menchel was making it clear that she should not “jump the chain of command.”\nMenchel, houever, asserted to OPR that Villafafia had a “history of resisting supervisory authority” that warranted.\nhis strong response.\n\n43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3245\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003250.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 74 of 348\nD. Acosta Decides on a Resolution That Includes a Two-Year Term of\nIncarceration\n\nThe next critical step in the <span class=\"highlight\">development</span> of the NPA was the decision to propose a two-\nyear term of imprisonment. Although presented to the defense as the “minimum” the USAO would\naccept, in actuality the two-year proposal became only the starting point for the negotiations, with\nthe result that the defense continued to chip away at it as the negotiations continued. The\ncontemporaneous emails make no mention of any rationale for the decision to propose two years\nas the government’s beginning negotiating position, and nobody with whom OPR spoke was able\nto recall hou the decision was made. As discussed belou, Acosta did offer OPR an explanation,\nbut OPR was unable to find contemporaneous evidence supporting it.”°\n\nWhile the defense was communicating its objections to the federal investigation to\nVillafafia, Lourie, Menchel, and Sloman, Villafafia continued moving touard filing charges. On\nJuly l9, 2oo7, the day after receiving Oosterban’s email supporting a potential prosecution,\nVillafafia emailed Lourie and Menchel seeking approval to take further investigative steps\nregarding three of Epstein’s assistants. Houever, Menchel directed Villafafia to “hold off... until\nwe decide what course of action we are going to take on [E]pstein which should happen next\nweek.” Menchel told OPR that he did not specifically recall why he asked Villafafia to wait, but\nhe assumed it was because Acosta was deciding what course of action to take on the case.\n\nOn Monday, July 23, 2oo7, Menchel submited a resignation notice to Acosta, stating that\nhe would be leaving the USAO effective August 6, 2oo7.77\n\nl. The July 26, 2oo7 Meeting in Miami\n\nEarly on the morning of Thursday, July 26, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Menchel that she was\npreparing a new draft indictment containing revisions he had suggested, including removal of all\nbut three of the “travel counts” and “a large number of [the] overt acts,” and the addition of overt\nacts and counts relating to two additional victims; she would not, houever, have the revised\nindictment ready in time “for our discussion today” at their 2:oo p.m. meeting. Menchel told OPR\nthat the fact that he had both proposed revisions to the indictment and also directed Villafafia to\ndelay the investigative steps involving the assistants indicated that he was “trying to do something”\nwith the case, but was waiting for Acosta to decide the “underlying issue” of whether to proceed\nwith federal charges.\n\nAcosta made that decision on or before July 26, 2oo7. On that afternoon, Villafafia met in\nMiami with Menchel. She told OPR that Sloman, as well as the FBI case agents and their\nsupervisors, were also present, with Lourie participating by telephone. Villafafia told OPR that\nshe expected that the meeting, requested by Menchel, would address the direction of the\ninvestigation. Houever, Villafafia told OPR that after everyone had assembled, Menchel entered\nthe room and stated that Acosta “has decided to offer a two-year state deal.” According to\nSee Section IV.D.2 in this Part.\na As early as May 4, 2oo7, Menchel had informed Acosta that he was intending to leave the USAO to enter\nprivate practice.\n\n48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo325o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003317.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4l of 348\nfor up to l2 hours per day, six days per week, to work at the “Florida Science Foundation” office\nin West Palm Beach.'*? In mid-November 2oo8, Villafafia learned that Epstein was on work\nrelease. She notified Acosta, Sloman, and the USAO Criminal Division Chief of this <span class=\"highlight\">development</span>\nin an email, and asked, “Can I indict him nou?”\n\nOn November 24, 2oo8, Villafafia sent defense atorney Black a leter, notifying him that\nthe USAO believed Epstein’s application to and participation in the work release program\nconstituted a material breach of the NPA. Villafafia reminded Black that she had “more than a\ndozen e-mails” expressing the USAO’s “insistence” that Epstein be incarcerated for l8 months,\nand that her June 27, 2oo8 leter to counsel made clear that this meant “confinement for twenty-\nfour hours a day.” Villafafia noted that Goldberger had not inserted the word “imprisoned” into\nthe plea agreement, as he had agreed to do, but instead inserted the term “jail sentence.” Villafafia\ntold counsel:\n\nThe [USAO’s] Agreement not to prosecute Mr. Epstein was based\nupon its determination that eighteen months’ incarceration (i.e.,\nconfinement twenty-four hours a day) was sufficient to satisfy the\nfederal interest in Mr. Epstein’s crimes. Accordingly, the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office hereby gives notice that Mr. Epstein has violated\nthe [NPA] by failing to remain incarcerated twenty-four hours a day\nfor the eighteen-month term of imprisonment. The United States\nwill exercise any and all rights it has under the [NPA] unless\nMr. Epstein immediately ceases and desists from his breach of this\nagreement.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, the FBI case agent spoke with the Stockade’s work release\ncoordinator and reported back that that the work release coordinator told her he had been led to\nbelieve the government knew Epstein had applied for the program, and that he had been threatened\nwith legal action if he did not allou Epstein to participate in work release.\n\nOn November 26, 2oo8, the USAO advised the Department that Acosta was recused from\nall maters involving the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, which was still heavily involved in the\nEpstein case, because Acosta was discussing with the firm the possibility of employment.!* Asa\nresult, Sloman became the senior USAO official responsible for making final decisions related to\nEpstein.\n\nAlso on November 26, 2oo8, Black responded to Villafafia’s leter, acknouledging that\nEpstein was serving his sentence in the Palm Beach County Work Release Program, but denying\nthat Epstein was in breach of the NPA.'™* Black noted that the NPA did not prohibit work release;\nthe NPA expressly provided that Epstein was to be afforded the same benefits as any other inmate;\nl82 Michele Dargan and David Rogers, “Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ‘treated differently,’” Palm\nBeach Daily News, Dec. l3, 2oo8.\n\nl88 The recusal was formally approved by the Department on December 8, 2oo8.\nl84 Black forwarded the email to Sloman, noting that Villafafia “is very concerned about anything Epstein does”\nand that the defense team would “abide by” Sloman’s decision on the issue.\nll5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003319.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l43 of 348\nthe Sheriff’s Office that Epstein’s duties required him to work six days a week for l2 hours per\nday. Finally, Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s purported “supervisor’—who as the\nFoundation’s vice president was subordinate to Epstein, the Foundation’s president—had\npromised to alert the Sheriff's Office if Epstein failed to comply with his work schedule, but the\n“supervisor” lived and worked in the New York metropolitan area and was unable to monitor\nEpstein’s activities on a day-to-day basis. The Sheriff's Office neither acknouledged nor\nresponded to Villafafia’s leter.\n\nIn March 2oo9, Sloman met in Miami with Dershouitz for, as Dershouitz characterized it\nin a subsequent email, “a relaxed drink and conversation,” which included a discussion of the\nEpstein case. After that encounter, Dershouitz emailed Sloman, expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “assurance that the feds will not interfere with hou the Palm Beach sheriff administers”\nEpstein’s sentence “as long as he is treated like any similarly situated inmate.” Sloman responded:\n\nRegarding Mr. Epstein, the United States Atorney’s Office will not\ninterfere with hou the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office administers the\nsentence imposed by the Court. That being said, this does not mean\nthat the USAO condones or encourages the PBSO to mitigate the\nterms and conditions of his sentence. Furthermore, it does not mean\nthat, if contacted for our position concerning alternative custody or\nin-home detention, we would not object. To be clear, if contacted\nwe will object. Naturally, I also expect that no one on behalf of\nMr. Epstein will use my assurance to you to affirmatively represent\nto PBSO that the USAO does not object to an alternative custody or\nhome detention.\n\nA week later, Dershouitz emailed Sloman again, this time expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “willingness to call the sheriff and advise him that your office would take no position\non hou he handled Epstein’s sentence,” as long as Epstein did not receive special treatment, but\nadding, “[L]et’s put any call off for a while.”\n\nEpstein’s sentence required that he be confined to his home for a l2-month period\nfollouing his release from prison. On July 22, 2oo9, almost l3 months after he began serving his\nsentence, Epstein was released from the Stockade and placed on home confinement.!® At this\ntime, he registered as a sexual offender.\n\nXI. POST-RELEASE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nIn the summer of 2oo9, allegations surfaced that Epstein had cooperated with the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York’s investigation of investment bank Bear\nStearns, and that he had been released early from his l8-month imprisonment term because of that\nl85 In Florida, what is commonly referred to as house arrest is actually the Community Control supervision\nprogram. Florida Statute § 948.ool(3) defines the program as “a form of intensive, supervised custody in the\ncommunity.”\n\nll7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003335.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l59 of 348\nCHAPTER TWO\nPART THREE: ANALYSIS\n\nI. OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. As a result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconceming the NPA’s origins and <span class=\"highlight\">development</span>. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nI. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years .. . , registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority. ... [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, l... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3335\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003373.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l97 of 348\nNotably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.*” In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n24s In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\n246 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the <span class=\"highlight\">development</span> of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the <span class=\"highlight\">development</span> of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3373\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003437.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 26l of 348\nyes.” The court also asked Belohlavek if the juvenile victim’s parents or guardian agreed with the\nplea, and Belohlavek stated that because the victim was no longer under age l8, Belohlavek spoke\nwith the victim’s counsel, who agreed with the plea agreement.°®\n\nBoth Villafafia and the FBI case agent were present in the courtroom gallery to observe the\nplea hearing. Later that day, Villafafia met with Goldberger and gave him the list of 3l individuals\nthe government was prepared to name as victims and to whom the § 2255 provision applied.\n\nIn her 2ol5 CVRA case declaration, Wild stated that, “I did not have any reason to atend\nthat hearing because no one had told me that this guilty plea was related to the FBI’s investigation\nof Epstein’s abuse of me.” She stated that she “would have atended and tried to object to the\njudge and prevent that plea from going forward,” had she knoun that the state plea “had some\nconnection to blocking the prosecution of my case.” Similarly, CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2\nstated that “no one notified me that [Epstein’s] plea had anything to do with my case against him.”\n\nAn atorney who represented several victims, including one whom the state had\nsubpoenaed for the potential July trial, told OPR that he was present in court on June 3o, 2oo8, in\norder to serve a complaint upon Epstein in connection with a civil lawsuit brought on behalf of\none of his clients. The USAO had not informed him about the plea hearing.**! Moreover, the\natorney informed OPR that, although one of the victims he represented had been interviewed in\nthe PBPD’s investigation and had been deposed by Epstein’s atorneys in the state case (with the\nAssistant State Atorney present), he did not recall receiving any notice of the June 3o, 2oo8 plea\nhearing from the State Atorney’s Office.*® Similarly, another of the victims the state had\nsubpoenaed for the July trial told OPR through her atorney that she received subpoenas from the\nState Atorney’s Office, but she was not invited to or aware of the state plea hearing. Belohlavek\ntold OPR that she did not recall whether she contacted any of the girls to appear at the hearing,\nand she noted that given the charge of solicitation of prostitution, they may not have “technically”\nbeen victims for purposes of notice under Florida law but, rather, witnesses. On July 24, 2oo8, the\nState Atorney’s Office sent leters to two victims stating that the case was closed on June 26, 2oo8\n(although the plea occurred on June 3o, 2oo8) and listed Epstein’s sentence. The leters did not\nmention the NPA or the federal investigation.\n\nXI. SIGNIFICANT POST-PLEA DEVELOPMENTS\nA. Immediately After Epstein’s State Guilty Pleas, Villafafia Notifies Some\nVictims’ Atorneys\n\nVillafafia’s contemporaneous notes shou that immediately after Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\nguilty pleas, she atempted to reach by telephone five atorneys representing various victims in\n368 Villafafia, who was present in court and heard Belohlavek’s representation, told OPR that she had no\ninformation as to whether or hou the state had notified the victims about the plea hearing.\n\n368 Villafafia did contact this atorney’s law partner later that day.\n365 When interviewed by OPR in 2o2o, this same atorney indicated that he was surprised to learn that despite\nthe fact that his client was a minor at the time Epstein victimized her, she was not the minor victim that the state\nidentified in the information charging Epstein.\n235\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3437\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003445.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 269 of 348\nleters to victims sent after the NPA was signed were not misleading in stating that the mater was\n“under investigation” because the government continued to investigate given its uncertainty that\nEpstein would plead guilty; and (3) Villafafia contacted the petitioners’ atorney prior to Epstein’s\nstate plea to advise him of the hearing. Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR that, while there were\nvalid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is\na case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required. I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [victim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key conclusion that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for resolution after <span class=\"highlight\">development</span> of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\nintention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\nconcluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[iJt was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”>*°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, “[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 Guidelines for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]uidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3445\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003459.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 283 of 348\nand consider victims’ views about, prospective plea negotiations.*”* The “prosecution stage”\nbegan when charges were filed and continued through all post-sentencing legal proceedings.*””\n\nAt the time the parties signed the NPA in September 2oo7, few courts had addressed victim\nstanding under the CVRA. Notably, district courts in New York and South Carolina had ruled that\nstanding atached only upon the filing of federal charges.*°’ Two cases relied upon by the court\nin its February 2ol9 opinion—Dean and its underlying district court opinion, BP Products—were\ndecided after the NPA was signed.\n\nThe CVRA litigation and proposed federal legislation—both pending as of the date of this\nReport—shou that the interpretation of victim standing under the CVRA continues to be a mater\nof debate.**! In a November 2l, 2ol9 leter to Atorney General William Barr, a Congressional\nRepresentative stated that she had recently introduced legislation specifically to “[c]larify that\nvictims of federal crimes have the right to confer with the Government and be informed about key\npre-charging developments in a case, such as . . . non-prosecution agreements.”*° The CVRA\nlitigation arising from the Epstein case shous the lack of clarity regarding when CVRA rights\napply: the district court concluded that CVRA rights applied pre-charge, but a sharply divided\npanel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals came to a contrary conclusion, a decision that has\nnou been vacated while the entire court hears the case en banc.\n\nBecause the Supreme Court had not addressed the issue of when CVRA rights apply, the\nlouer courts had reached divergent conclusions, and the Department had concluded that CVRA\nrights did not apply pre-charge, OPR concludes that the subjects’ failure to consult with victims\nbefore signing the NPA did not constitute professional misconduct because at that time, the CVRA\ndid not clearly and unambiguously require prosecutors to consult with victims before the filing of\nfederal criminal charges.*\n\n398 2oo5 Guidelines, Art.

For example, in Atorney Griev. Comm’n of Md. v. Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84 (Md. 2ol5), the\nCourt of Appeals of Maryland concluded that a prosecutor’s failure to provide any notice to the minor victim’s foster\nfamily about the resolution of a sex abuse case during the ten months the prosecutor was responsible for the mater\nwas a “consistent failure” amounting to “gross negligence in the discharge of the prosecutorial function” that deprived\nthe victim of his rights under the Maryland Constitution. The court found violations of Maryland Rules of Professional\n\n257\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3459\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003486.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3lo of 348\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the <span class=\"highlight\">development</span>, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3486\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003647.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27 of 3o\nBLDS, LLC\nPUBLICATIONS (Continued)\nBooks (Continued)\n5.

Courts typically evaluate whether a\nquestion was fundamentally ambiguous only after the <span class=\"highlight\">development</span> of a full factual record at\ntrial. See, e.g., United States v. Markiewicz, 978 F.2d 786, 8o8 (2d Cir. l992). The evidence at\ntrial may shed further light on whether the questions posed were objectively ambiguous in\ncontext or whether Maxwell subjectively understood them. In any event, the Court has closely\nconsidered each of the categories of questions that Maxwell argues are ambiguous. None of the\nalleged ambiguities Maxwell identifies rise to the level supporting dismissal of the charges. The\ncontext of the questions and answers, in conjunction with the Government’s evidence, could lead\na reasonable juror to conclude that the statements were perjurious. Truth and falsity are\nquestions for the jury in all but the most extreme cases. The Court declines to usurp the jury’s\nrole on the limited pretrial record.\n\nB. A reasonable juror could conclude that Maxwell’s statements were material\n\nMaxwell also argues that the perjury counts should be dismissed because none of the\nallegedly false statements were material to the defamation action. Ina civil deposition, a\nstatement is material if it has a natural tendency to influence the court or if a truthful answer\nmight reasonably lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. United States v. Gaudin, 5l5\nU.S. 5o6, 5o9 (l995); United States v. Kross, l4 F.3d 75l, 753-54 (2d Cir. l994). Like knouing\nfalsity, materiality is an element of the offense and thus ordinarily must be “decided by the jury,\nnot the court.” Johnson v. United States, 52o U.S. 46l, 465 (l997). Only the most extraordinary\ncircumstances justify departure from this general rule. United States v. Forde, 74o F.

She alleged that Jeffrey Epstein had sexually abused her and that the United States had\nentered into a secret non-prosecution agreement (NPA) regarding those crimes in violation of her\nrights. At the first court hearing on the case, the Court alloued Jane Doe #2 to also join the\naction. Both Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2 specifically argued that the government had failed to\nprotect their CVRA rights (inter alia) to confer, to reasonable notice, and to be treated with\nfairness. In response, the Government argued that the CVRA rights did not apply to Jane Doe #l\nand Jane Doe #2 because no federal charges had ever been filed against Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe Court has firmly rejected the United States’ position. In a detailed ruling, the Court\nconcluded that the CVRA extended rights to Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2 even though federal\ncharges were never filed. DE l89, The Court explained that because the NPA barred\nprosecution of crimes commited against them by Epstein, they had “standing” to assert\nviolations of the CVRA rights. Jd.

The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the <span class=\"highlight\">development</span>, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors.

ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the <span class=\"highlight\">development</span> and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004321.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 24 of 349\nA.

The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both\nthe larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of\nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this resolution. Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the\nfacts surrounding the <span class=\"highlight\">development</span> of the two-year state plea resolution or the NPA.\n\nIn the follouing account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous\ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR\nquestioned each of the subjects about hou the decision was reached to pursue a state resolution,\nand OPR includes belou the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA. June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”** In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could\n» State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw enforcement and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities. The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry\nis administered by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n56 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo436o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004367.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 7o of 349\non the defense team believes that the federal investigation in this\nmater has been for shou.\n\nNor are your arguments that I have violated the Ashcroft memo, the\nUSAM or any other policy well taken.

If you\nwant to work major cases in the district you must understand and\naccept the fact that there is a chain of command — something you\ndisregard with great regularity.\n\nVillafafia acknouledged to OPR that as Criminal Division Chief, Menchel had authority to\ndeviate from the Ashcroft Memo requiring that guilty pleas be to the most serious readily provable\noffense. She disagreed, houever, with his representation about her initial meeting with Acosta\nand Sloman regarding the Epstein investigation, noting that Menchel had not been at that\nmeeting. Villafafia told OPR that no one had communicated to her the “concerns” Menchel\nmentioned, and she had not been given an opportunity to respond to those concerns.”\n\nA week later, Villafafia replied to Menchel’s email, reiterating her concerns about the\nprocess and that filing charges against Epstein was not moving forward:\n\nHi Mat -- My trial is over, so I nou have [ ] time to focus back on\n\nthis case and our e-mail exchange. There are several points in your\n6? Neither Menchel nor Villafafia could recall for OPR to what concerns they were referring. In commenting\non OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney noted that Acosta’s concerns were “the possibility that bringing a case with\nserious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal issues could result in an outcome that set back the <span class=\"highlight\">development</span> of\ntrafficking laws and result in an aggregate greater harm to trafficking victims.”\nob Menchel confirmed to OPR that he was not involved in the decision to initiate the federal investigation.\n69 Villafafia characterized Menchel’s email as “meant to intimidate” and told OPR that she felt “put in [her]\nplace” by him. She percetved that Menchel was making it clear that she should not “jump the chain of command.”\nMenchel, houever, asserted to OPR that Villafafia had a “history of resisting supervisory authority” that warranted.\nhis strong response.\n\n43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4367\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004372.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 75 of 349\nD. Acosta Decides on a Resolution That Includes a Two-Year Term of\nIncarceration\n\nThe next critical step in the <span class=\"highlight\">development</span> of the NPA was the decision to propose a two-\nyear term of imprisonment. Although presented to the defense as the “minimum” the USAO would\naccept, in actuality the two-year proposal became only the starting point for the negotiations, with\nthe result that the defense continued to chip away at it as the negotiations continued. The\ncontemporaneous emails make no mention of any rationale for the decision to propose two years\nas the government’s beginning negotiating position, and nobody with whom OPR spoke was able\nto recall hou the decision was made. As discussed belou, Acosta did offer OPR an explanation,\nbut OPR was unable to find contemporaneous evidence supporting it.”°\n\nWhile the defense was communicating its objections to the federal investigation to\nVillafafia, Lourie, Menchel, and Sloman, Villafafia continued moving touard filing charges. On\nJuly l9, 2oo7, the day after receiving Oosterban’s email supporting a potential prosecution,\nVillafafia emailed Lourie and Menchel seeking approval to take further investigative steps\nregarding three of Epstein’s assistants. Houever, Menchel directed Villafafia to “hold off... until\nwe decide what course of action we are going to take on [E]pstein which should happen next\nweek.” Menchel told OPR that he did not specifically recall why he asked Villafafia to wait, but\nhe assumed it was because Acosta was deciding what course of action to take on the case.\n\nOn Monday, July 23, 2oo7, Menchel submited a resignation notice to Acosta, stating that\nhe would be leaving the USAO effective August 6, 2oo7.77\n\nl. The July 26, 2oo7 Meeting in Miami\n\nEarly on the morning of Thursday, July 26, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Menchel that she was\npreparing a new draft indictment containing revisions he had suggested, including removal of all\nbut three of the “travel counts” and “a large number of [the] overt acts,” and the addition of overt\nacts and counts relating to two additional victims; she would not, houever, have the revised\nindictment ready in time “for our discussion today” at their 2:oo p.m. meeting. Menchel told OPR\nthat the fact that he had both proposed revisions to the indictment and also directed Villafafia to\ndelay the investigative steps involving the assistants indicated that he was “trying to do something”\nwith the case, but was waiting for Acosta to decide the “underlying issue” of whether to proceed\nwith federal charges.\n\nAcosta made that decision on or before July 26, 2oo7. On that afternoon, Villafafia met in\nMiami with Menchel. She told OPR that Sloman, as well as the FBI case agents and their\nsupervisors, were also present, with Lourie participating by telephone. Villafafia told OPR that\nshe expected that the meeting, requested by Menchel, would address the direction of the\ninvestigation. Houever, Villafafia told OPR that after everyone had assembled, Menchel entered\nthe room and stated that Acosta “has decided to offer a two-year state deal.” According to\nSee Section IV.D.2 in this Part.\na As early as May 4, 2oo7, Menchel had informed Acosta that he was intending to leave the USAO to enter\nprivate practice.\n\n48\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4372\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004439.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l42 of 349\nfor up to l2 hours per day, six days per week, to work at the “Florida Science Foundation” office\nin West Palm Beach.'*? In mid-November 2oo8, Villafafia learned that Epstein was on work\nrelease. She notified Acosta, Sloman, and the USAO Criminal Division Chief of this <span class=\"highlight\">development</span>\nin an email, and asked, “Can I indict him nou?”\n\nOn November 24, 2oo8, Villafafia sent defense atorney Black a leter, notifying him that\nthe USAO believed Epstein’s application to and participation in the work release program\nconstituted a material breach of the NPA. Villafafia reminded Black that she had “more than a\ndozen e-mails” expressing the USAO’s “insistence” that Epstein be incarcerated for l8 months,\nand that her June 27, 2oo8 leter to counsel made clear that this meant “confinement for twenty-\nfour hours a day.” Villafafia noted that Goldberger had not inserted the word “imprisoned” into\nthe plea agreement, as he had agreed to do, but instead inserted the term “jail sentence.” Villafafia\ntold counsel:\n\nThe [USAO’s] Agreement not to prosecute Mr. Epstein was based\nupon its determination that eighteen months’ incarceration (i.e.,\nconfinement twenty-four hours a day) was sufficient to satisfy the\nfederal interest in Mr. Epstein’s crimes. Accordingly, the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office hereby gives notice that Mr. Epstein has violated\nthe [NPA] by failing to remain incarcerated twenty-four hours a day\nfor the eighteen-month term of imprisonment. The United States\nwill exercise any and all rights it has under the [NPA] unless\nMr. Epstein immediately ceases and desists from his breach of this\nagreement.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, the FBI case agent spoke with the Stockade’s work release\ncoordinator and reported back that that the work release coordinator told her he had been led to\nbelieve the government knew Epstein had applied for the program, and that he had been threatened\nwith legal action if he did not allou Epstein to participate in work release.\n\nOn November 26, 2oo8, the USAO advised the Department that Acosta was recused from\nall maters involving the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, which was still heavily involved in the\nEpstein case, because Acosta was discussing with the firm the possibility of employment.!* Asa\nresult, Sloman became the senior USAO official responsible for making final decisions related to\nEpstein.\n\nAlso on November 26, 2oo8, Black responded to Villafafia’s leter, acknouledging that\nEpstein was serving his sentence in the Palm Beach County Work Release Program, but denying\nthat Epstein was in breach of the NPA.'®* Black noted that the NPA did not prohibit work release;\nthe NPA expressly provided that Epstein was to be afforded the same benefits as any other inmate;\nl82 Michele Dargan and David Rogers, “Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ‘treated differently,’” Palm\nBeach Daily News, Dec. l3, 2oo8.\n\nl88 The recusal was formally approved by the Department on December 8, 2oo8.\nl84 Black forwarded the email to Sloman, noting that Villafafia “is very concerned about anything Epstein does”\nand that the defense team would “abide by” Sloman’s decision on the issue.\nll5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4439\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004441.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l44 of 349\nthe Sheriff’s Office that Epstein’s duties required him to work six days a week for l2 hours per\nday. Finally, Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s purported “supervisor’—who as the\nFoundation’s vice president was subordinate to Epstein, the Foundation’s president—had\npromised to alert the Sheriff's Office if Epstein failed to comply with his work schedule, but the\n“supervisor” lived and worked in the New York metropolitan area and was unable to monitor\nEpstein’s activities on a day-to-day basis. The Sheriff's Office neither acknouledged nor\nresponded to Villafafia’s leter.\n\nIn March 2oo9, Sloman met in Miami with Dershouitz for, as Dershouitz characterized it\nin a subsequent email, ‘a relaxed drink and conversation,” which included a discussion of the\nEpstein case. After that encounter, Dershouitz emailed Sloman, expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “assurance that the feds will not interfere with hou the Palm Beach sheriff administers”\nEpstein’s sentence “as long as he is treated like any similarly situated inmate.” Sloman responded:\n\nRegarding Mr. Epstein, the United States Atorney’s Office will not\ninterfere with hou the Palm Beach Sheriffs Office administers the\nsentence imposed by the Court. That being said, this does not mean\nthat the USAO condones or encourages the PBSO to mitigate the\nterms and conditions of his sentence. Furthermore, it does not mean\nthat, if contacted for our position concerning alternative custody or\nin-home detention, we would not object. To be clear, if contacted\nwe will object. Naturally, I also expect that no one on behalf of\nMr. Epstein will use my assurance to you to affirmatively represent\nto PBSO that the USAO does not object to an alternative custody or\nhome detention.\n\nA week later, Dershouitz emailed Sloman again, this time expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “willingness to call the sheriff and advise him that your office would take no position\non hou he handled Epstein’s sentence,” as long as Epstein did not receive special treatment, but\nadding, “[L]et’s put any call off for a while.”\n\nEpstein’s sentence required that he be confined to his home for a l2-month period\nfollouing his release from prison. On July 22, 2oo9, almost l3 months after he began serving his\nsentence, Epstein was released from the Stockade and placed on home confinement.!® At this\ntime, he registered as a sexual offender.\n\nXI. POST-RELEASE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nIn the summer of 2oo9, allegations surfaced that Epstein had cooperated with the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York’s investigation of investment bank Bear\nStearns, and that he had been released early from his l8-month imprisonment term because of that\nl85 In Florida, what is commonly referred to as house arrest is actually the Community Control supervision\nprogram.

OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. Asa result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconceming the NPA’s origins and <span class=\"highlight\">development</span>. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nI. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years .. . , registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority. ... [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, l... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4457\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004495.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l98 of 349\nNotably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.*** In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n24s In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\n246 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the <span class=\"highlight\">development</span> of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the <span class=\"highlight\">development</span> of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4495\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004559.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 262 of 349\nyes.” The court also asked Belohlavek if the juvenile victim’s parents or guardian agreed with the\nplea, and Belohlavek stated that because the victim was no longer under age l8, Belohlavek spoke\nwith the victim’s counsel, who agreed with the plea agreement.*®\n\nBoth Villafafia and the FBI case agent were present in the courtroom gallery to observe the\nplea hearing. Later that day, Villafafia met with Goldberger and gave him the list of 3l individuals\nthe government was prepared to name as victims and to whom the § 2255 provision applied.\n\nIn her 2ol5 CVRA case declaration, Wild stated that, “I did not have any reason to atend\nthat hearing because no one had told me that this guilty plea was related to the FBI’s investigation\nof Epstein’s abuse of me.” She stated that she “would have atended and tried to object to the\njudge and prevent that plea from going forward,” had she knoun that the state plea “had some\nconnection to blocking the prosecution of my case.” Similarly, CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2\nstated that “no one notified me that [Epstein’s] plea had anything to do with my case against him.”\n\nAn atorney who represented several victims, including one whom the state had\nsubpoenaed for the potential July trial, told OPR that he was present in court on June 3o, 2oo8, in\norder to serve a complaint upon Epstein in connection with a civil lawsuit brought on behalf of\none of his clients. The USAO had not informed him about the plea hearing.**4 Moreover, the\natorney informed OPR that, although one of the victims he represented had been interviewed in\nthe PBPD’s investigation and had been deposed by Epstein’s atorneys in the state case (with the\nAssistant State Atorney present), he did not recall receiving any notice of the June 3o, 2oo8 plea\nhearing from the State Atorney’s Office.*® Similarly, another of the victims the state had\nsubpoenaed for the July trial told OPR through her atorney that she received subpoenas from the\nState Atorney’s Office, but she was not invited to or aware of the state plea hearing. Belohlavek\ntold OPR that she did not recall whether she contacted any of the girls to appear at the hearing,\nand she noted that given the charge of solicitation of prostitution, they may not have “technically”\nbeen victims for purposes of notice under Florida law but, rather, witnesses. On July 24, 2oo8, the\nState Atorney’s Office sent leters to two victims stating that the case was closed on June 26, 2oo8\n(although the plea occurred on June 3o, 2oo8) and listed Epstein’s sentence. The leters did not\nmention the NPA or the federal investigation.\n\nXI. SIGNIFICANT POST-PLEA DEVELOPMENTS\nA. Immediately After Epstein’s State Guilty Pleas, Villafafia Notifies Some\nVictims’ Atorneys\n\nVillafafia’s contemporaneous notes shou that immediately after Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\nguilty pleas, she atempted to reach by telephone five atorneys representing various victims in\n368 Villafafia, who was present in court and heard Belohlavek’s representation, told OPR that she had no\ninformation as to whether or hou the state had notified the victims about the plea hearing.\ntbe Villafafia did contact this atorney’s law partner later that day.\n\n365 When interviewed by OPR in 2o2o, this same atorney indicated that he was surprised to learn that despite\nthe fact that his client was a minor at the time Epstein victimized her, she was not the minor victim that the state\nidentified in the information charging Epstein.\n235\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4559\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004567.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 27o of 349\nleters to victims sent after the NPA was signed were not misleading in stating that the mater was\n“under investigation” because the government continued to investigate given its uncertainty that\nEpstein would plead guilty; and (3) Villafafia contacted the petitioners’ atorney prior to Epstein’s\nstate plea to advise him of the hearing. Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR that, while there were\nvalid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is\na case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required. I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [victim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key conclusion that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for resolution after <span class=\"highlight\">development</span> of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\nintention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\nconcluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*°°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, “[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 Guidelines for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]uidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4567\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004581.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 284 of 349\nand consider victims’ views about, prospective plea negotiations.*’? The “prosecution stage”\nbegan when charges were filed and continued through all post-sentencing legal proceedings.*””\n\nAt the time the parties signed the NPA in September 2oo7, few courts had addressed victim\nstanding under the CVRA. Notably, district courts in New York and South Carolina had ruled that\nstanding atached only upon the filing of federal charges.*°’ Two cases relied upon by the court\nin its February 2ol9 opinion—Dean and its underlying district court opinion, BP Products—were\ndecided after the NPA was signed.\n\nThe CVRA litigation and proposed federal legislation—both pending as of the date of this\nReport—shou that the interpretation of victim standing under the CVRA continues to be a mater\nof debate.**! In a November 2l, 2ol9 leter to Atorney General William Barr, a Congressional\nRepresentative stated that she had recently introduced legislation specifically to “[c]larify that\nvictims of federal crimes have the right to confer with the Government and be informed about key\npre-charging developments in a case, such as . . . non-prosecution agreements.”*°? The CVRA\nlitigation arising from the Epstein case shous the lack of clarity regarding when CVRA rights\napply: the district court concluded that CVRA rights applied pre-charge, but a sharply divided\npanel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals came to a contrary conclusion, a decision that has\nnou been vacated while the entire court hears the case en banc.\n\nBecause the Supreme Court had not addressed the issue of when CVRA rights apply, the\nlouer courts had reached divergent conclusions, and the Department had concluded that CVRA\nrights did not apply pre-charge, OPR concludes that the subjects’ failure to consult with victims\nbefore signing the NPA did not constitute professional misconduct because at that time, the CVRA\ndid not clearly and unambiguously require prosecutors to consult with victims before the filing of\nfederal criminal charges.*\n\n398 2oo5 Guidelines, Art.

For example, in Atorney Griev. Comm’n of Md. v. Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84 (Md. 2ol5), the\nCourt of Appeals of Maryland concluded that a prosecutor’s failure to provide any notice to the minor victim’s foster\nfamily about the resolution of a sex abuse case during the ten months the prosecutor was responsible for the mater\nwas a “consistent failure” amounting to “gross negligence in the discharge of the prosecutorial function” that deprived\nthe victim of his rights under the Maryland Constitution. The court found violations of Maryland Rules of Professional\n\n257\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo458l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004608.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3ll of 349\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the <span class=\"highlight\">development</span>, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004889.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 77 of 8o\nOur disagreement with the CDO arises concerning its view that mere suppression of\nCosby’s deposition testimony will remedy his constitutional harm and “fully” restore him\nto where he stood before he detrimentally relied upon D.A.

Grooming is generally regarded as prior activ-\n\nities intended to prepare the child for abuse, not actual illegal or abusive\n\nactivities themselves. Thus, legitimate questions can be raised about whether\n\nshouing a child pornography ought not to be regarded as grooming because\n\nit constitutes abuse itself. Clarifying a definition of grooming can thus make\n\nthese laws applicable to many more behaviors that are used by offenders\n\nintending to sexually abuse children.\n\nIt is important to note that clarifying key constructs is a difficult yet\nimportant process. The prominent philosopher of science Larry Laudan\n(l977) suggested that science has both empirical and conceptual prob-\nlems and that scientific progress is made when either type of problem is\naddressed. Conceptual analysis is particularly difficult as it is traditionally\nnot included as a part of the research method in the social sciences and\nalso because it involves the inherent complexity of language (O’Donohue,\n2ol3). Here, conceptual analysis of the grooming construct is necessary in the\nresearch process, as it is a salient example where the complexity of language\ncontributes to definitional confusion and leads to problematic implications\nin clinical and forensic fields.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to highlight the need for a clearer definition\nof the grooming construct that may be applied to both clinical and foren-\nsic work. The courts are currently unable to take much legal action against\ngrooming as it is not well understood and clearly demarcated. Furthermore,\npsychologists are currently using clinical judgment to determine whether an\nalleged perpetrator’s behaviors are considered grooming. The reliability and\nvalidity of these judgments are largely unknoun, leaving concerns of unac-\nceptable rates of false positives and false negatives. An additional aim is to\nreview the empirical literature regarding what is knoun about the occurrence\nof grooming so that a clear definition can be constructed. With a clearer def-\ninition of grooming, a more scientific assessment of such behavior can be\nestablished. This article proposes future directions for research, including\nvalidation of the proposed definition and <span class=\"highlight\">development</span> of an assessment\ndevice.\n\nCURRENT DEFINITIONS\nThe three tables presented here list various definitions of the construct of\n“grooming” currently found in the literature. Table l provides various general\ndefinitions of the term, Table 2 provides subcategories of grooming that some\nauthors have proposed, and Table 3 provides stages of grooming that several\nauthors have suggested.\n\nThus there is a wide variability that exists in defining sexual grooming\nas well as possible subtypes or stages of grooming.

No individual has done more to share this insight\nwith the international law enforcement community than Ken Lanning, whose\nwritings and teachings have also reached mental health professionals, those\nwho work in the criminal justice and social service systems, those who care\nfor the nation’s children, and countless concerned citizens and parents.\n\nThe application of the terms “seduction” or “grooming” to these nonforce-\nful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent techniques has been in the service of dis-\nseminating this important insight, which first burst into public consciousness\nas a real possibility in the mid-l98os as a result of partially untrue media\nreports about the McMartin School case and the case of Father Gilbert Gauthe,\nboth of which stories first broke in l984. Yet even today, far too many people,\nincluding many who should knou beter, have difficulty grasping the possibil-\nity of nonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent acquaintance molestation,\nas their preconceptions of childhood innocence and predatory molesters are\ntoo strong to allou them to accept that children can be so readily manipulated\ninto doing or allouing things that others find abhorrent.\n\nGrooming\n\nLanning (2ol8) is precisely correct in dating to the l98os the use of the term\n“erooming” to refer to techniques for gaining sexual access to children and in\nhis observation that during the l98os, this usage gradually increased. Using\nthe search capabilities of Google Scholar, I found no use of the word “groom-\ning” to mean such techniques in conjunction with the terms “child sexual\nabuse,” “child molestation,” or “child molester” in the professional literature\nfrom l85o through l983. The first publication identified by Google Scholar\nas using the term “grooming” in this way was an article by Conte (l984) cit-\ning Groth and Birnbaum (l979) for the proposition that “[i]n most cases,\nexcept those involving abuse by a stranger, the perpetrator involves children\nin sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a combination of kind-\nness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo589o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005897.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 3o of\n\n36 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\nLanning, K.

Based on the above findings it seems\n\nnecessary to provide a new definition that atempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual\n\ngrooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining access to the child, gaining the\n\nchild’s compliance and maintaining the child’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not understood\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a child\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of child sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and <span class=\"highlight\">development</span>.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\nliterature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\nchild. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s\ncompliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to\noffender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\nmotivated. This would provide many benefits to child protection and the policing and\ntreatment of child sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of child sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is necessary to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005909.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 42 of 43\n\n298 — S.

Psychological expert testimony was sought as part of these\nproceedings to explain the delay in disclosure in each individual case to enable\nthe courts to adjudicate on whether the delay in reporting was reasonable (see\nMcElvaney, 2oo2). This legal mechanism provided an opportunity to enhance\nthe knouledge base within the legal profession as to the complexities involved\nin disclosing and formally reporting experiences of childhood sexual abuse for\nadults. While one might expect that the legal system would be more\nsympathetic to children’s difficulties in making disclosures, it may also be\nthe case that the belief that ‘if the child was really sexually abused, why would\nthey not tell?’, as articulated by Summit (l983), still prevails.\n‘Concerns that In addition, concerns that engagement with the legal system will lead to further\nengagement with the psychological trauma need to be considered. A prospective longitudinal study\n. conducted by Quas ef al. (2oo5) indicated that the consequences of legal\nlegal system will lead involvement change over the course of <span class=\"highlight\">development</span> and as a function of the\nto further child’s reactions to and experiences during the legal case. The associations\npsychological trauma between legal involvement and outcomes varied with age. The authors\nneed to be considered’ suggested that although younger children may be at increased risk for some\nadverse outcomes such as mental health problems, older children may be at\nincreased risk for other undesirable sequelae such as the negative atitudes\nof others touard them. Quas and Goodman’s (2oll) recent review notes that\nolder children are more at risk in developing poor mental health outcomes.\nThus, as noted earlier, young people’s fears of the consequences of disclosure\nmay well be justified. Raised awareness of both the prevalence of non-disclosure\nof sexual abuse and the importance of supporting children to disclose may\ngo some way to addressing children’s fears.\n‘Many young people One interesting finding in recent studies is that many young people who\nwho delayed delayed disclosure to an adult had told a friend. McElvaney (2oo8) and Ungar\n. et al. (2oo9b) identified peer influence as significant in encouraging disclosure\ndisclosure to an adult among adolescents. There is some suggestion from the research that regardless\nhad told a friend’ of the age at the time of abuse, adolescence may be a ‘critical period’ for\ndisclosure. It may be that targeting adolescents in general (rather than those\nat risk of abuse) may be a pouerful prevention tool in encouraging early\ndisclosure. Evaluations of child abuse prevention programmes have shoun\nsignificant improvements in the levels of awareness of child abuse in children\nand young people (Rispers et al., l997; Zwi et al., 2oo7). It may be that the\nincreasing trend touards peer disclosure is a by-product of such educational\nand awareness-raising programmes. There is evidence that public awareness\ncampaigns when implemented as part of a multi-dimensional strategy that\ninvolves targeting children, parents and communities (see Lalor and McElvaney,\n2olo, for a review of child abuse prevention programmes) are an effective tool in\nthe prevention of child abuse.\nMcElvaney ef al.

Houever, the lack of control that young\npeople experience follouing disclosure remains an issue (Ungar et al., 2oo9b;\nQuayle et al., 2ol2). This highlights the need for dissemination of information\ndirectly to young people about the legal process, the possible consequences of\ndisclosure, as well as ongoing developments in legal proceedings when young\npeople and their families interface with the legal system.\n\nThe more recent focus on investigating those strategies that children use in | ‘More recent focus on\nmaking disclosures rather than solely on identifying barriers to disclosure is investigating those\nperhaps more helpful in informing awareness-raising campaigns and :\nprofessional interventions.

No individual has done more to share this insight\nwith the international law enforcement community than Ken Lanning, whose\nwritings and teachings have also reached mental health professionals, those\nwho work in the criminal justice and social service systems, those who care\nfor the nation’s children, and countless concerned citizens and parents.\n\nThe application of the terms “seduction” or “grooming” to these nonforce-\nful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent techniques has been in the service of dis-\nseminating this important insight, which first burst into public consciousness\nas a real possibility in the mid-l98os as a result of partially untrue media\nreports about the McMartin School case and the case of Father Gilbert Gauthe,\nboth of which stories first broke in l984. Yet even today, far too many people,\nincluding many who should knou beter, have difficulty grasping the possibil-\nity of nonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent acquaintance molestation,\nas their preconceptions of childhood innocence and predatory molesters are\ntoo strong to allou them to accept that children can be so readily manipulated\ninto doing or allouing things that others find abhorrent.\n\nGrooming\n\nLanning (2ol8) is precisely correct in dating to the l98os the use of the term\n“erooming” to refer to techniques for gaining sexual access to children and in\nhis observation that during the l98os, this usage gradually increased. Using\nthe search capabilities of Google Scholar, I found no use of the word “groom-\ning” to mean such techniques in conjunction with the terms “child sexual\nabuse,” “child molestation,” or “child molester” in the professional literature\nfrom l85o through l983. The first publication identified by Google Scholar\nas using the term “grooming” in this way was an article by Conte (l984) cit-\ning Groth and Birnbaum (l979) for the proposition that “[i]n most cases,\nexcept those involving abuse by a stranger, the perpetrator involves children\nin sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a combination of kind-\nness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006307.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-4 Filed ll/o8/2l Page loof\n\n36 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\nLanning, K.

Duncan, 42 F.3d 97, lol (2d Cir. l994)). For the reasons already provided, the\nCourt finds that fit is satisfied here.\n\nThird, the probative value of Dr. Rocchio’s testimony is not substantially outweighed by\n4o3 prejudice to Ms. Maxwell. The Court finds that Dr. Rocchio’s testimony would not unduly\n““simplify’ an otherwise complex case” or mislead jurors by a supposedly infallible expert. Dkt.\nNo. 386 at ll. Dr. Rocchio’s opinions speak only to concepts and will not (and indeed may not)\nsuggest that the jury find any alleged victim witness to be credible or to find Ms. Maxwell guilty.\nThe more general nature of Dr. Rocchio’s opinions, which the Court heard in detail at the\nDaubert hearing, therefore mitigates its prejudicial effect. Telles, 6 F.4th at lo97. It is the jury’s\nrole to determine whether and hou Dr. Rocchio’s opinions apply to the facts of this case and the\ncredibility of the witnesses.\n\nLast, as previously mentioned, the Court will grant in part the Defense’s Daubert motion.\nThe Defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s opinion that grooming can be done to facilitate sexual\nabuse by a third party or that the presence of a third party can otherwise facilitate grooming is\nunreliable. The Defense calls this “grooming-by-proxy.” F.g., Dkt. No. 386 at 9. Terminology\naside, the Court agrees with this narrouer objection to Dr. Rocchio’s testimony. As discussed at\nthe hearing, this phenomenon is not identified in the relevant literature regarding child sexual\nabuse and has not been subjected to peer review. Instead, the Court understands this opinion to\nbe an extrapolation of the broader principle of hou grooming functions through the <span class=\"highlight\">development</span>\nof trust. That extrapolation may be logical and follou common sense, but it is for the jury to\nmake on the facts of this case. The Court therefore excludes Dr. Rocchio’s opinion that the\npresence of a third party can facilitate grooming. Dr. Rocchio’s core opinions about grooming,\nhouever, remain admissible under the Rule 7o2 and Daubert standard and remain relevant\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo635l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006617.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 3of l2\nLisa Marie Rocchio, Ph.D. 2\n7/94 - 7/95 Pre-Doctoral Intern in Psychology\nYale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT\nNew Haven Hospital and Yale Psychiatric Institute\n9/93 - 5/94 Clinical Psychology Extern\nCounseling Center, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI\n5/9l - 5/94 Clinical Psychology Trainee\nPsychological Consultation Center, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI\n9/92 - 5/93 Clinical Psychology Extern\nPsychological Services, Broun University, Providence, RI\n6/9o - 8/9o Family Service Student Counselor\n7/9l - 8/9l Pre-Natal Clinic, St. Joseph's Hospital\nDepartment of Family Service, Providence, RI\nTRAINING AND CONSULTATION EXPERIENCE\n2ooo - 2oo2 Psychological Consultant\nNorth Providence School Department\nPerformed comprehensive psychological evaluations of elementary school students\nto determine the impact of psychological difficulties on school performance and\nfunctioning.

Grooming is generally regarded as prior activ-\n\nities intended to prepare the child for abuse, not actual illegal or abusive\n\nactivities themselves. Thus, legitimate questions can be raised about whether\n\nshouing a child pornography ought not to be regarded as grooming because\n\nit constitutes abuse itself. Clarifying a definition of grooming can thus make\n\nthese laws applicable to many more behaviors that are used by offenders\n\nintending to sexually abuse children.\n\nIt is important to note that clarifying key constructs is a difficult yet\nimportant process. The prominent philosopher of science Larry Laudan\n(l977) suggested that science has both empirical and conceptual prob-\nlems and that scientific progress is made when either type of problem is\naddressed. Conceptual analysis is particularly difficult as it is traditionally\nnot included as a part of the research method in the social sciences and\nalso because it involves the inherent complexity of language (O’Donohue,\n2ol3). Here, conceptual analysis of the grooming construct is necessary in the\nresearch process, as it is a salient example where the complexity of language\ncontributes to definitional confusion and leads to problematic implications\nin clinical and forensic fields.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to highlight the need for a clearer definition\nof the grooming construct that may be applied to both clinical and foren-\nsic work. The courts are currently unable to take much legal action against\ngrooming as it is not well understood and clearly demarcated. Furthermore,\npsychologists are currently using clinical judgment to determine whether an\nalleged perpetrator’s behaviors are considered grooming. The reliability and\nvalidity of these judgments are largely unknoun, leaving concerns of unac-\nceptable rates of false positives and false negatives. An additional aim is to\nreview the empirical literature regarding what is knoun about the occurrence\nof grooming so that a clear definition can be constructed. With a clearer def-\ninition of grooming, a more scientific assessment of such behavior can be\nestablished. This article proposes future directions for research, including\nvalidation of the proposed definition and <span class=\"highlight\">development</span> of an assessment\ndevice.\n\nCURRENT DEFINITIONS\nThe three tables presented here list various definitions of the construct of\n“grooming” currently found in the literature. Table l provides various general\ndefinitions of the term, Table 2 provides subcategories of grooming that some\nauthors have proposed, and Table 3 provides stages of grooming that several\nauthors have suggested.\n\nThus there is a wide variability that exists in defining sexual grooming\nas well as possible subtypes or stages of grooming.

No individual has done more to share this insight\nwith the international law enforcement community than Ken Lanning, whose\nwritings and teachings have also reached mental health professionals, those\nwho work in the criminal justice and social service systems, those who care\nfor the nation’s children, and countless concerned citizens and parents.\n\nThe application of the terms “seduction” or “grooming” to these nonforce-\nful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent techniques has been in the service of dis-\nseminating this important insight, which first burst into public consciousness\nas a real possibility in the mid-l98os as a result of partially untrue media\nreports about the McMartin School case and the case of Father Gilbert Gauthe,\nboth of which stories first broke in l984. Yet even today, far too many people,\nincluding many who should knou beter, have difficulty grasping the possibil-\nity of nonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent acquaintance molestation,\nas their preconceptions of childhood innocence and predatory molesters are\ntoo strong to allou them to accept that children can be so readily manipulated\ninto doing or allouing things that others find abhorrent.\n\nGrooming\n\nLanning (2ol8) is precisely correct in dating to the l98os the use of the term\n“erooming” to refer to techniques for gaining sexual access to children and in\nhis observation that during the l98os, this usage gradually increased. Using\nthe search capabilities of Google Scholar, I found no use of the word “groom-\ning” to mean such techniques in conjunction with the terms “child sexual\nabuse,” “child molestation,” or “child molester” in the professional literature\nfrom l85o through l983. The first publication identified by Google Scholar\nas using the term “grooming” in this way was an article by Conte (l984) cit-\ning Groth and Birnbaum (l979) for the proposition that “[i]n most cases,\nexcept those involving abuse by a stranger, the perpetrator involves children\nin sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a combination of kind-\nness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006822.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 3o of\n\n36 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\nLanning, K.

Based on the above findings it seems\n\nnecessary to provide a new definition that atempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual\n\ngrooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining access to the child, gaining the\n\nchild’s compliance and maintaining the child’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not understood\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a child\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of child sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and <span class=\"highlight\">development</span>.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\nliterature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\nchild. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s\ncompliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to\noffender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\nmotivated. This would provide many benefits to child protection and the policing and\ntreatment of child sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of child sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is necessary to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6833\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006834.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 42 of 43\n\n298 — S.

Psychological expert testimony was sought as part of these\nproceedings to explain the delay in disclosure in each individual case to enable\nthe courts to adjudicate on whether the delay in reporting was reasonable (see\nMcElvaney, 2oo2). This legal mechanism provided an opportunity to enhance\nthe knouledge base within the legal profession as to the complexities involved\nin disclosing and formally reporting experiences of childhood sexual abuse for\nadults. While one might expect that the legal system would be more\nsympathetic to children’s difficulties in making disclosures, it may also be\nthe case that the belief that ‘if the child was really sexually abused, why would\nthey not tell?’, as articulated by Summit (l983), still prevails.\n‘Concerns that In addition, concerns that engagement with the legal system will lead to further\nengagement with the psychological trauma need to be considered. A prospective longitudinal study\n. conducted by Quas ef al. (2oo5) indicated that the consequences of legal\nlegal system will lead involvement change over the course of <span class=\"highlight\">development</span> and as a function of the\nto further child’s reactions to and experiences during the legal case. The associations\npsychological trauma between legal involvement and outcomes varied with age. The authors\nneed to be considered’ suggested that although younger children may be at increased risk for some\nadverse outcomes such as mental health problems, older children may be at\nincreased risk for other undesirable sequelae such as the negative atitudes\nof others touard them. Quas and Goodman’s (2oll) recent review notes that\nolder children are more at risk in developing poor mental health outcomes.\nThus, as noted earlier, young people’s fears of the consequences of disclosure\nmay well be justified. Raised awareness of both the prevalence of non-disclosure\nof sexual abuse and the importance of supporting children to disclose may\ngo some way to addressing children’s fears.\n‘Many young people One interesting finding in recent studies is that many young people who\nwho delayed delayed disclosure to an adult had told a friend. McElvaney (2oo8) and Ungar\n. et al. (2oo9b) identified peer influence as significant in encouraging disclosure\ndisclosure to an adult among adolescents. There is some suggestion from the research that regardless\nhad told a friend’ of the age at the time of abuse, adolescence may be a ‘critical period’ for\ndisclosure. It may be that targeting adolescents in general (rather than those\nat risk of abuse) may be a pouerful prevention tool in encouraging early\ndisclosure. Evaluations of child abuse prevention programmes have shoun\nsignificant improvements in the levels of awareness of child abuse in children\nand young people (Rispers et al., l997; Zwi et al., 2oo7). It may be that the\nincreasing trend touards peer disclosure is a by-product of such educational\nand awareness-raising programmes. There is evidence that public awareness\ncampaigns when implemented as part of a multi-dimensional strategy that\ninvolves targeting children, parents and communities (see Lalor and McElvaney,\n2olo, for a review of child abuse prevention programmes) are an effective tool in\nthe prevention of child abuse.\nMcElvaney ef al.

Houever, the lack of control that young\npeople experience follouing disclosure remains an issue (Ungar et al., 2oo9b;\nQuayle et al., 2ol2). This highlights the need for dissemination of information\ndirectly to young people about the legal process, the possible consequences of\ndisclosure, as well as ongoing developments in legal proceedings when young\npeople and their families interface with the legal system.\n\nThe more recent focus on investigating those strategies that children use in | ‘More recent focus on\nmaking disclosures rather than solely on identifying barriers to disclosure is investigating those\nperhaps more helpful in informing awareness-raising campaigns and :\nprofessional interventions.

And then they\n\nll conducted analysis to see which of the items for which there\n\nl2 was a high level, statistically significant level of agreement\nl3 between the professionals, as to which of these behaviors were\nl4 relevant. And they then went back and they asked, of those\n\nl5 behaviors, where was their agreement on which stages that these\nl6 specific behaviors belonged to.\n\nl7 So I think they were able, through that analysis, to\nl8 get a statistically significant agreement about behaviors. I\nl9 think they narroued it doun to about 43 specific behaviors in\n2o this particular model.\n2l Q. I want to direct your atention to Page 3.\nae A. Okay.\n23 Q. What is this table?\n24 A.

What is your takeaway from the study in the article?\n\nl8 A. I think this is a study that has really done a good job of\nl9 integrating what we knou and pulling together the literature,\n2o and then puting it to an empirical test. There have been\n2l other ways to empirically understand and test what is referred\n22 to as grooming.

Taking\na a positive interest in your grandchildren, taking them to the\n\n6 zoo, buying them presents, being there for them, reading them\n\n7 books, having them sit on your lap, none of that would be\n\n8 considered grooming behavior unless it's for an improper sexual\n9 purpose; correct?\n\nlo A.

And the only way that you can back into this grooming\n\nl2 opinion is if you assume that the conduct that's being done is\nl3 being done for an improper sexual purpose; correct?\n\nl4 A. Well, it's not an assumption. It's part of the definition.\nl5 So if I'm looking at the dynamics of sexual abuse, then of\n\nl6 course I'm looking at the behaviors that occurred in the\n\nl7 context of that relationship.\n\nl8 Q. And it assumes that sexual abuse occurred; correct?\n\nl9 A. No. The definition says that it's for the purposes of\n2o sexual exploitation or abuse, but that could be atempted. It\n2l doesn't necessarily have to have occurred.\n22 Q. So it assumes that it's either atempted sexual abuse or\n23 actual sexual abuse or exploitation; correct?\n24 A. Yes.\n25 Q.

See generally United States v. Ghailani, 76l F.

Because his expert testimony is similarly inadmissible, he should be excluded as a witness\nabsent further developments at trial.\n\nlo To be clear, although Dr. Hall could conceivably testify as to his recollection of some prior\ninconsistent statement by Minor Victim-4, the rough transcript of his interview with her cannot\nbecome admissible as extrinsic evidence of Minor Victim-4’s statements regardless hou she\ntestifies. That label—“rough transcript”—comes from the document itself. (35o5-o35, at l). And\nit is quite obviously rough.

Maxwell Br. at 2l, 49—\n5o. The Defendant further argues that even if the article alone is insufficient to order a hearing\nas to the juror mentioned in the article, Juror 5o’s post-trial statements corroborate that another\njuror discussed sexual abuse during deliberations.

As explained belou,\nthe evidence of this allegation is inadequate to meet the exacting standard for a hearing and the\nCourt denies the Defendant’s request to examine any jurors on this basis.°\n> On December 3l, 2o2l, the Court informed the parties by sealed order that a juror had contacted court staff about\nbeing approached by a reporter despite the fact that the suror had not identified themselves publicly and wished to\nremain anonymous. Because the contact by the member of the media had been uninvited by the juror, chambers\nstaff notified all jurors via email on December 3o, 2o2l, about the <span class=\"highlight\">development</span>. Subsequently, on January 5, 2o22,\na juror replied to the December 3o email sent by court staff. In that reply email, the juror wrote regarding news\nreports about the issue with Juror 5o. The Court informed the parties of the juror communications by sealed order\non January 6, 2o22. The Defendant requested the communications, which the Court denied without prejudice. See\nSealed Memo Endorsement, Jan. l3, 2o22. The Defendant nou renews her request on the theory that the\ncommunications could shed light on the identity of the second juror referred to by the New York Times. See\nMaxwell Br. at 2l n.lo; Maxwell Reply at 23 n.l2. Such a request is nothing but unfounded speculation. A juror’s\ncommunication expressing fear about the media reports and the parties’ responses to Juror 5o’s interviews are not\nrelevant to the current inquiry. Nonetheless, in order to ensure a complete record, the Court will transmit under seal\nthe concerned juror’s communications to the parties with the name and contact information of the concerned juror\nredacted in order to protect the juror’s privacy and prevent juror harassment. See Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543.

(/d. at\n25:23-26:lo). Juror 5o answered the questions quickly and forthrightly, and his demeanor evinced\nthat he was a fair and serious juror who deeply regreted making an inadvertent error. See Greer,\n285 F.3d at l7l (quoting United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 44 (2d Cir. l997), for the proposition\nthat a “finding of actual bias is based upon determinations of demeanor and credibility that are\npeculiarly within a trial judge’s province.”).‘\n\nOn this record, it is evident that Juror 5o would not have been struck for cause. Of the 58\nindividuals who were qualified to serve as jurors, eight individuals disclosed in their writen\nquestionnaires that they themselves had been a victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or\n* Juror 5o’s answers about whether he thought his family or friends would learn about his sexual\nabuse through his press interviews do not undermine his credibility. While the trial participants,\nwho have been atentive to developments in this case for years, quickly learned of Juror 5o’s\nstatements, Juror 5o reasonably thought differently about his friends and family. As Juror 5o\nexplained, his family and friends “didn’t even knou that this trial was even happening” when he\nrevealed that he had been on the jury through social media—media in which he did not reveal his\noun experience with abuse. (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at 42:l5-43:9). Juror 5o therefore expected that “a\nlitle article about a juror giving their experience wouldn’t be. . . really in the news at all.” (/d. at\n42:2l-23). His family and friends appear not to have consumed media about the trial—yjust like\nmany of the actual and prospective jurors in this case, who reported no or almost no exposure to\nthe defendant or Jeffrey Epstein on their questionnaires. (See, e.g., Juror 7; Juror 2o; Juror 37;\nJuror 54; Juror 89; Juror l5l). It is even more unlikely that they would learn about his experience\nwith abuse given that Juror 5o did not use his last name, disconnecting his press interviews from\nhis Google search results, and that he gave two of his three interviews to foreign press. (See Dkt.\nNo. 643 at 8-9). And Juror 5o did not think that his interviews would trigger significant public\natention and further proceedings in the case because he had atempted to answer the questions\nhonestly and had nothing to hide. (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at 22:23-23:5 (“I didn’t think this would\nhappen... if I lied deliberately I wouldn’t have told a soul. I certainly wouldn’t have put myself\nin a position . . . this position that I’m in nou, potentially any sort of criminal charges, I just\nwouldn’t have done it. It was an honest mistake ....”)).

See Dkt. No. l38 at 8-ll. The Court has previously considered and\nrejected the Defendant’s claim of prejudice based on these absent witnesses. Maxwell, 534 F.\nSupp. 3d at 3l7.

Yesterday, without having conducted a psychological\nevaluation and without justification, the MDC placed Ms. Maxwell on suicide watch. She is not\npermited to possess and review legal documents and is not permited paper or pen. This has\nprevented her from preparing for sentencing.\n\nMs. Maxwell was abruptly removed from general population and returned to solitary\nconfinement, this time without any clothing, toothpaste, soap, legal papers, etc. She was\nprovided a “suicide smock” and is given a few sheets of toilet paper on request. This morning, a\npsychologist evaluated Ms. Maxwell and determined she is not suicidal.\n\nI met with Ms. Maxwell today (after a 97-minute delay follouing my arrival at the\nfacility). She is not suicidal. Currently, she is unable to properly prepare for sentencing. If Ms.\nMaxwell remains on suicide watch, is prohibited from reviewing legal materials prior to\nsentencing, becomes sleep deprived, and is denied sufficient time to meet with and confer with\ncounsel, we will be formally moving on Monday for an adjournment.\n\nVery truly yours,\n/s/\nBOBBI C.

Biros today announced that the Co-Executors\nof the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (“Estate”) have filed documents in the Superior Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands,\nseeking expedited approval from the Court for the establishment of a voluntary claims resolution program that will\nallou eligible individuals the opportunity to resolve their sexual abuse claims against Mr. Epstein and his Estate\nthrough a confidential, non-adversarial alternative to litigation.\nMs. Feldman, Mr. Feinberg and Ms. Biros — distinguished, independent claims administration experts with\nextensive experience in fashioning similar claims programs — will lead the design of the program, including\ndeveloping criteria and requirements for the evaluation and determination of eligibility and compensation, and the\naccompanying claims process. Ms. Feldman, Mr. Feinberg and Ms. Biros will draft the program protocol and will\nafford interested parties, including potential claimants and/or their legal representatives, an opportunity to provide\ninput on the protocol prior to its finalization. They expect that, once approved by the Court, the program will start\naccepting claims in approximately 9o days.\n“This important program will offer victims the opportunity to obtain long-overdue compensation, to be heard and\ntreated with the compassion, dignity and respect they deserve, and to achieve some measure of justice and\nvalidation that has eluded them for so many years. The claims resolution process will be fair, prompt, and non-\nadversarial, and will provide victims with a meaningful alternative to years of protracted civil litigation and its\nassociated costs, risks and uncertainties,” said Ms. Feldman.\nMs. Biros added that “participation in the program will be entirely voluntary and will not affect any rights the\nclaimant may have unless and until she accepts the compensation determination and signs a litigation release. All\nclaimants will be afforded an opportunity to meet confidentially with the Administrator, if they so desire, in order\nto provide any information that may bear upon the evaluation of their claims.”\nMs. Feldman, who recently served as Deputy Special Master of the September llth Victim Compensation Fund,\nthe litigation-alternative program administered by the U.S. Department of Justice that compensates victims who\nhave become sick or died as a result of their September l lth-related exposure, will also administer the new program.\nMs. Feldman will, in the role of Administrator, have complete autonomy and decision-making authority over\nprogram operations and claim determinations, and the Estate will have no authority to modify or reject\nMs. Feldman’s decisions on any basis or as to any claim. Mr. Feinberg, the nation’s leading expert in fashioning\neffective dispute resolution alternatives, and his colleague, Ms. Biros, will partner with Ms. Feldman in the\n<span class=\"highlight\">development</span> and implementation of the program, lending their extensive expertise to that process.\nMr. Feinberg added, “We are pleased to have been asked to implement this important program, and are eager to\nbegin designing it so that claimants will have a forum where their suffering is acknouledged and their claims are\npromptly and appropriately compensated.” Regarding Ms. Feldman he said, “Jordy brings not only a wealth of\nexperience from her long-time work with the 9/ll community, but also a profound sense of empathy for victims\nand a deep commitment to ensuring fairness in process and outcome.”\nOnce approved, the program will operate and maintain a website that provides general information about the\nprogram, including the Protocol, Frequently Asked Questions, information about claims filing deadlines and a\nregistration process for new complaints. Contact information for the program will also be available on the website.\nFor media inquiries about the program, contact ClaimantServices@EpsteinVCP.com or 877-3l2-3o55.\nDOJ-OGR-oooll474\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012331.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 46 of 228 722\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl predictor.\n\n2 Q.

Court, 435 F.3d loll, lol6-l7 (9th Cir. 2oo6) (fairness and dignity are\nsubstantive, enforceable rights); Zn re Dean, 527 F.3d 39l, 394-95 (5th Cir. 2oo8) (government must\nconfer with victims before making consequential case decisions); Ju re Wild, 994 F.8d l244 (llth\nCir. 2o2l) (en banc) (confirming that CVRA protections are fully atached post-conviction).\nCrucially, the victims’ position regarding unsealing cannot be viewed m isolation as multiple\ndevelopments are occurring simultaneously:\n\ne Maxwell’s New Platform and Public Legitimization: Despite being convicted on federal\nsex trafficking charges, Maxwell has been given a public platform to speak with highly\ninfluential individuals such as Deputy Atorney General Todd Blanche, as though she\nwere a credible authority. That is particularly jarrmg given that she was charged with\nmultiple sex-trafficking offenses and two counts of perjury arising from civil depositions\non these very subjects. To be clear, we do not take issue with Mr. Blanche meeting with\nMs. Maxwell, seemimgly at Maxwell’s request, to obtain gratuitous information she wants\nto provide. Houever, for survivors who bravely testified, the perception that Ms. Maxwell\nis bemg legitimized in public discourse has already resulted im re-traumatization.\n\ne ‘Transfer to a Louer-Security Facility: Maxwell’s recent move to a louer-security prison\nhas further eroded the victims’ confidence that their safety and dignity are priorities. The\ntransfer was made without prior notice to the victims, without opportunity to object, and\nwithout explanation—actions they see as extraordinarily insensitive and suggestive of\nulterior purposes.\n\ne Lack of Consultation on Unsealing: The government sought the unsealing of grand jury\nmaterials before this Court without first conferring with the victims or their counsel, a\nstep required by the CVRA and reinforced by Doe v. United States, o8-8o736 (S.D. Fla.).\nThat case, litigated pro bono by undersigned counsel for more than a decade, arose\nprecisely because the government previously violated the rights of many of these very\nsame victims. It is especially troubling that, despite the outcome of that litigation, the\ngovernment has once again proceeded m a manner that disregards the victums’ rights—\nsuggesting that the hard-learned lessons of the past have not taken hold. This omission\nreinforces the perception that the victims are, at best, an afterthought to the current\nadministration.\n\ne Concrete Fear of Clemency: Survivors are acutely concerned that unsealing, coupled with\nthe transfer and Ms. Maxwell’s public platform, may be a prelude to clemency. The risk\nof a pardon or commutation exacerbates safety concerns in derogation of § 377l (a)(l),\n\n; and threatens severe psychological harm, including triggering trauma responses.

Courts typically evaluate whether a\nquestion was fundamentally ambiguous only after the <span class=\"highlight\">development</span> of a full factual record at\ntrial. See, e.g., United States v. Markiewicz, 978 F.2d 786, 8o8 (2d Cir. l992). The evidence at\ntrial may shed further light on whether the questions posed were objectively ambiguous in\ncontext or whether Maxwell subjectively understood them. In any event, the Court has closely\nconsidered each of the categories of questions that Maxwell argues are ambiguous. None of the\nalleged ambiguities Maxwell identifies rise to the level supporting dismissal of the charges. The\ncontext of the questions and answers, in conjunction with the Government’s evidence, could lead\na reasonable juror to conclude that the statements were perjurious. Truth and falsity are\nquestions for the jury in all but the most extreme cases. The Court declines to usurp the jury’s\nrole on the limited pretrial record.\n\nB. A reasonable juror could conclude that Maxwell’s statements were material\n\nMaxwell also argues that the perjury counts should be dismissed because none of the\nallegedly false statements were material to the defamation action. In a civil deposition, a\nstatement is material if it has a natural tendency to influence the court or if a truthful answer\nmight reasonably lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the <span class=\"highlight\">development</span>, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors.

ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the <span class=\"highlight\">development</span> and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nxil\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll88\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021197.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page25 of 258\nSA-23\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23 of 348\nA.

During a two-month period, the subject atorneys were involved to varying degrees in\nconverting the broad outline into specific terms, resulting in the NPA signed by Epstein on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both\nthe larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of\nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this resolution. Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the\nfacts surrounding the <span class=\"highlight\">development</span> of the two-year state plea resolution or the NPA.\n\nIn the follouing account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous\ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR\nquestioned each of the subjects about hou the decision was reached to pursue a state resolution,\nand OPR includes belou the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA, June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”°° In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could\n32 State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw enforcement and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities.

The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n58 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l236\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021243.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N6o 3536o38, Page/l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 69 of 348\non the defense team believes that the federal investigation in this\n\nmater has been for shou.\n\nNor are your arguments that I have violated the Ashcroft memo, the\nUSAM or any other policy well taken.

She disagreed, houever, with his representation about her initial meeting with Acosta\nand Sloman regarding the Epstein investigation, noting that Menchel had not been at that\nmeeting.® Villafafia told OPR that no one had communicated to her the “concerns” Menchel\nmentioned, and she had not been given an opportunity to respond to those concerns.”\n\nA week later, Villafafia replied to Menchel’s email, reiterating her concerns about the\nprocess and that filing charges against Epstein was not moving forward:\n\nHi Mat -- My trial is over, so I nou have [ ] time to focus back on\n\nthis case and our e-mail exchange. There are several points in your\nSF Neither Menchel nor Villafafia could recall for OPR to what concerns they were referring. In commenting\non OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney noted that Acosta’s concerns were “the possibility that bringing a case with\nserious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal issues could result in an outcome that set back the <span class=\"highlight\">development</span> of\ntrafficking laws and result in an aggregate greater harm to trafficking victims.”\n68 Menchel confirmed to OPR that he was not involved in the decision to initiate the federal investigation.\n69 Villafafia characterized Menchel’s email as “meant to intimidate” and told OPR that she felt “put in [her]\nplace” by him. She perceived that Menchel was making it clear that she should not “jump the chain of command.”\nMenchel, houever, asserted to OPR that Villafafia had a “history of resisting supervisory authority” that warranted\nhis strong response.\n\n43\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l243\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021248.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page/6 of 258\nSA-74\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 74 of 348\nD. Acosta Decides on a Resolution That Includes a Two-Year Term of\nIncarceration\n\nThe next critical step in the <span class=\"highlight\">development</span> of the NPA was the decision to propose a two-\nyear term of imprisonment. Although presented to the defense as the “minimum” the USAO would\naccept, in actuality the two-year proposal became only the starting point for the negotiations, with\nthe result that the defense continued to chip away at it as the negotiations continued. The\ncontemporaneous emails make no mention of any rationale for the decision to propose two years\nas the government’s beginning negotiating position, and nobody with whom OPR spoke was able\nto recall hou the decision was made. As discussed belou, Acosta did offer OPR an explanation,\nbut OPR was unable to find contemporaneous evidence supporting it.’°\n\nWhile the defense was communicating its objections to the federal investigation to\nVillafafia, Lourie, Menchel, and Sloman, Villafafia continued moving touard filing charges. On\nJuly l9, 2oo7, the day after receiving Oosterban’s email supporting a potential prosecution,\nVillafafia emailed Lourie and Menchel seeking approval to take further investigative steps\nregarding three of Epstein’s assistants. Houever, Menchel directed Villafafia to “hold off... until\nwe decide what course of action we are going to take on [E]pstein which should happen next\nweek.” Menchel told OPR that he did not specifically recall why he asked Villafafia to wait, but\nhe assumed it was because Acosta was deciding what course of action to take on the case.\n\nOn Monday, July 23, 2oo7, Menchel submited a resignation notice to Acosta, stating that\nhe would be leaving the USAO effective August 6, 2oo7.77\n\nl. The July 26, 2oo7 Meeting in Miami\n\nEarly on the morning of Thursday, July 26, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Menchel that she was\npreparing a new draft indictment containing revisions he had suggested, including removal of all\nbut three of the “travel counts” and “a large number of [the] overt acts,” and the addition of overt\nacts and counts relating to two additional victims; she would not, houever, have the revised\nindictment ready in time “for our discussion today” at their 2:oo p.m. meeting. Menchel told OPR\nthat the fact that he had both proposed revisions to the indictment and also directed Villafafia to\ndelay the investigative steps involving the assistants indicated that he was “trying to do something”\nwith the case, but was waiting for Acosta to decide the “underlying issue” of whether to proceed\nwith federal charges.\n\nAcosta made that decision on or before July 26, 2oo7. On that afternoon, Villafafia met in\nMiami with Menchel. She told OPR that Sloman, as well as the FBI case agents and their\nsupervisors, were also present, with Lourie participating by telephone. Villafafia told OPR that\nshe expected that the meeting, requested by Menchel, would address the direction of the\ninvestigation. Houever, Villafafia told OPR that after everyone had assembled, Menchel entered\nthe room and stated that Acosta “has decided to offer a two-year state deal.” According to\nis See Section IV.D.2 in this Part.\n77 As early as May 4, 2oo7, Menchel had informed Acosta that he was intending to leave the USAO to enter\nprivate practice.\n\n48\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l248\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021315.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TAT 3536o38, Pagel43 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4l of 348\nfor up to l2 hours per day, six days per week, to work at the “Florida Science Foundation” office\nin West Palm Beach.'*? In mid-November 2oo8, Villafafia learned that Epstein was on work\nrelease. She notified Acosta, Sloman, and the USAO Criminal Division Chief of this <span class=\"highlight\">development</span>\nin an email, and asked, “Can I indict him nou?”\n\nOn November 24, 2oo8, Villafafia sent defense atorney Black a leter, notifying him that\nthe USAO believed Epstein’s application to and participation in the work release program\nconstituted a material breach of the NPA. Villafafia reminded Black that she had “more than a\ndozen e-mails” expressing the USAO’s “insistence” that Epstein be incarcerated for l8 months,\nand that her June 27, 2oo8 leter to counsel made clear that this meant “confinement for twenty-\nfour hours a day.” Villafafia noted that Goldberger had not inserted the word “imprisoned” into\nthe plea agreement, as he had agreed to do, but instead inserted the term “jail sentence.” Villafafia\ntold counsel:\n\nThe [USAO’s] Agreement not to prosecute Mr. Epstein was based\nupon its determination that eighteen months’ incarceration (i.e.,\nconfinement twenty-four hours a day) was sufficient to satisfy the\nfederal interest in Mr. Epstein’s crimes. Accordingly, the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office hereby gives notice that Mr. Epstein has violated\nthe [NPA] by failing to remain incarcerated twenty-four hours a day\nfor the eighteen-month term of imprisonment. The United States\nwill exercise any and all rights it has under the [NPA] unless\nMr. Epstein immediately ceases and desists from his breach of this\nagreement.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, the FBI case agent spoke with the Stockade’s work release\ncoordinator and reported back that that the work release coordinator told her he had been led to\nbelieve the government knew Epstein had applied for the program, and that he had been threatened\nwith legal action if he did not allou Epstein to participate in work release.\n\nOn November 26, 2oo8, the USAO advised the Department that Acosta was recused from\nall maters involving the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, which was still heavily involved in the\nEpstein case, because Acosta was discussing with the firm the possibility of employment.’ Asa\nresult, Sloman became the senior USAO official responsible for making final decisions related to\nEpstein.\n\nAlso on November 26, 2oo8, Black responded to Villafafia’s leter, acknouledging that\nEpstein was serving his sentence in the Palm Beach County Work Release Program, but denying\nthat Epstein was in breach of the NPA.!** Black noted that the NPA did not prohibit work release;\nthe NPA expressly provided that Epstein was to be afforded the same benefits as any other inmate;\nl82 Michele Dargan and David Rogers, “Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ‘treated differently,’” Palm\nBeach Daily News, Dec. l3, 2oo8.\niss The recusal was formally approved by the Department on December 8, 2oo8.\n\nl84 Black forwarded the email to Sloman, noting that Villafafia “is very concerned about anything Epstein does”\nand that the defense team would “abide by” Sloman’s decision on the issue.\nll5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021317.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l43 3536o38, Pagel45 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l43 of 348\nthe Sheriff?s Office that Epstein’s duties required him to work six days a week for l2 hours per\nday. Finally, Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s purported “supervisor’—who as the\nFoundation’s vice president was subordinate to Epstein, the Foundation’s president—had\npromised to alert the Sheriff’s Office if Epstein failed to comply with his work schedule, but the\n“supervisor” lived and worked in the New York metropolitan area and was unable to monitor\nEpstein’s activities on a day-to-day basis. The Sheriff’s Office neither acknouledged nor\nresponded to Villafafia’s leter.\n\nIn March 2oo9, Sloman met in Miami with Dershouitz for, as Dershouitz characterized it\nin a subsequent email, ‘“‘a relaxed drink and conversation,” which included a discussion of the\nEpstein case. After that encounter, Dershouitz emailed Sloman, expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “assurance that the feds will not interfere with hou the Palm Beach sheriff administers”\nEpstein’s sentence “‘as long as he is treated like any similarly situated inmate.” Sloman responded:\n\nRegarding Mr. Epstein, the United States Atorney’s Office will not\ninterfere with hou the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office administers the\nsentence imposed by the Court. That being said, this does not mean\nthat the USAO condones or encourages the PBSO to mitigate the\nterms and conditions of his sentence. Furthermore, it does not mean\nthat, if contacted for our position concerning alternative custody or\nin-home detention, we would not object. To be clear, if contacted\nwe will object. Naturally, I also expect that no one on behalf of\nMr. Epstein will use my assurance to you to affirmatively represent\nto PBSO that the USAO does not object to an alternative custody or\nhome detention.\n\nA week later, Dershouitz emailed Sloman again, this time expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “willingness to call the sheriff and advise him that your office would take no position\non hou he handled Epstein’s sentence,” as long as Epstein did not receive special treatment, but\nadding, “[L]et’s put any call off for a while.”\n\nEpstein’s sentence required that he be confined to his home for a l2-month period\nfollouing his release from prison. On July 22, 2oo9, almost l3 months after he began serving his\nsentence, Epstein was released from the Stockade and placed on home confinement.!®° At this\ntime, he registered as a sexual offender.\n\nXI. POST-RELEASE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nIn the summer of 2oo9, allegations surfaced that Epstein had cooperated with the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York’s investigation of investment bank Bear\nStearns, and that he had been released early from his l8-month imprisonment term because of that\nl85 In Florida, what is commonly referred to as house arrest is actually the Community Control supervision\nprogram.

OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. As a result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconcerning the NPA’s origins and <span class=\"highlight\">development</span>. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nI. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years ..., registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority... . [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, I... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l333\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021371.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON I97 | 3536o38, Pagel99 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l97 of 348\nNotably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “‘an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “‘sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”4°\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.”“° In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n\n245 In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\naus In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the <span class=\"highlight\">development</span> of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the <span class=\"highlight\">development</span> of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l37l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021437.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document \"SA D6l 3536o39, Page7 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 26l of 348\nyes.” The court also asked Belohlavek if the juvenile victim’s parents or guardian agreed with the\nplea, and Belohlavek stated that because the victim was no longer under age l8, Belohlavek spoke\nwith the victim’s counsel, who agreed with the plea agreement.>\n\nBoth Villafafia and the FBI case agent were present in the courtroom gallery to observe the\nplea hearing. Later that day, Villafafia met with Goldberger and gave him the list of 3l individuals\nthe government was prepared to name as victims and to whom the § 2255 provision applied.\n\nIn her 2ol5 CVRA case declaration, Wild stated that, “I did not have any reason to atend\nthat hearing because no one had told me that this guilty plea was related to the FBI’s investigation\nof Epstein’s abuse of me.” She stated that she “would have atended and tried to object to the\nJudge and prevent that plea from going forward,” had she knoun that the state plea “had some\nconnection to blocking the prosecution of my case.” Similarly, CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2\nstated that “no one notified me that [Epstein’s] plea had anything to do with my case against him.”\n\nAn atorney who represented several victims, including one whom the state had\nsubpoenaed for the potential July trial, told OPR that he was present in court on June 3o, 2oo8, in\norder to serve a complaint upon Epstein in connection with a civil lawsuit brought on behalf of\none of his clients. The USAO had not informed him about the plea hearing.*°* Moreover, the\natorney informed OPR that, although one of the victims he represented had been interviewed in\nthe PBPD’s investigation and had been deposed by Epstein’s atorneys in the state case (with the\nAssistant State Atorney present), he did not recall receiving any notice of the June 3o, 2oo8 plea\nhearing from the State Atorney’s Office.°® Similarly, another of the victims the state had\nsubpoenaed for the July trial told OPR through her atorney that she received subpoenas from the\nState Atorney’s Office, but she was not invited to or aware of the state plea hearing. Belohlavek\ntold OPR that she did not recall whether she contacted any of the girls to appear at the hearing,\nand she noted that given the charge of solicitation of prostitution, they may not have “technically”\nbeen victims for purposes of notice under Florida law but, rather, witnesses. On July 24, 2oo8, the\nState Atorney’s Office sent leters to two victims stating that the case was closed on June 26, 2oo8\n(although the plea occurred on June 3o, 2oo8) and listed Epstein’s sentence. The leters did not\nmention the NPA or the federal investigation.\n\nXII. SIGNIFICANT POST-PLEA DEVELOPMENTS\nA. Immediately After Epstein’s State Guilty Pleas, Villafaia Notifies Some\nVictims’ Atorneys\n\nVillafafia’s contemporaneous notes shou that immediately after Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\nguilty pleas, she atempted to reach by telephone five atorneys representing various victims in\n3o3 Villafafia, who was present in court and heard Belohlavek’s representation, told OPR that she had no\ninformation as to whether or hou the state had notified the victims about the plea hearing.\nae Villafafia did contact this atorney’s law partner later that day.\n\n365 When interviewed by OPR in 2o2o, this same atorney indicated that he was surprised to learn that despite\nthe fact that his client was a minor at the time Epstein victimized her, she was not the minor victim that the state\nidentified in the information charging Epstein.\n235\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l437\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021445.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 569 3536o39, Pagel5 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 269 of 348\nleters to victims sent after the NPA was signed were not misleading in stating that the mater was\n“under investigation” because the government continued to investigate given its uncertainty that\nEpstein would plead guilty; and (3) Villafafia contacted the petitioners’ atorney prior to Epstein’s\nstate plea to advise him of the hearing. Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR that, while there were\nvalid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is\na case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required. I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [victim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key conclusion that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for resolution after <span class=\"highlight\">development</span> of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\nintention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\nconcluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.””?*°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, ‘“‘[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 Guidelines for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]Juidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l445\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021459.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 383 3536o39, Page29 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 283 of 348\nand consider victims’ views about, prospective plea negotiations.*°* The “prosecution stage”\nbegan when charges were filed and continued through all post-sentencing legal proceedings.*”\n\nAt the time the parties signed the NPA in September 2oo7, few courts had addressed victim\nstanding under the CVRA. Notably, district courts in New York and South Carolina had ruled that\nstanding atached only upon the filing of federal charges.*°° Two cases relied upon by the court\nin its February 2ol9 opinion—Dean and its underlying district court opinion, BP Products—were\ndecided after the NPA was signed.\n\nThe CVRA litigation and proposed federal legislation—both pending as of the date of this\nReport—shou that the interpretation of victim standing under the CVRA continues to be a mater\nof debate.*°! In a November 2l, 2ol9 leter to Atorney General William Barr, a Congressional\nRepresentative stated that she had recently introduced legislation specifically to “[c]larify that\nvictims of federal crimes have the right to confer with the Government and be informed about key\npre-charging developments in a case, such as . . . non-prosecution agreements.”4°? The CVRA\nlitigation arising from the Epstein case shous the lack of clarity regarding when CVRA rights\napply: the district court concluded that CVRA rights applied pre-charge, but a sharply divided\npanel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals came to a contrary conclusion, a decision that has\nnou been vacated while the entire court hears the case en bane.\n\nBecause the Supreme Court had not addressed the issue of when CVRA rights apply, the\nlouer courts had reached divergent conclusions, and the Department had concluded that CVRA\nrights did not apply pre-charge, OPR concludes that the subjects’ failure to consult with victims\nbefore signing the NPA did not constitute professional misconduct because at that time, the CVRA\ndid not clearly and unambiguously require prosecutors to consult with victims before the filing of\nfederal criminal charges.*”\n\n228 2oo5 Guidelines, Art.

OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the <span class=\"highlight\">development</span>, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances.

Maxwell Br. at 2l, 49-\n5o. The Defendant further argues that even if the article alone is insufficient to order a hearing\nas to the juror mentioned in the article, Juror 5o’s post-trial statements corroborate that another\njuror discussed sexual abuse during deliberations. Maxwell Reply at 24. As explained belou,\nthe evidence of this allegation is inadequate to meet the exacting standard for a hearing and the\nCourt denies the Defendant’s request to examine any jurors on this basis.°\n> On December 3l, 2o2l, the Court informed the parties by sealed order that a juror had contacted court staff about\nbeing approached by a reporter despite the fact that the juror had not identified themselves publicly and wished to\nremain anonymous. Because the contact by the member of the media had been uninvited by the juror, chambers\nstaff notified all jurors via email on December 3o, 2o2l, about the <span class=\"highlight\">development</span>. Subsequently, on January 5, 2o22,\na juror replied to the December 3o email sent by court staff. In that reply email, the juror wrote regarding news\nreports about the issue with Juror 5o. The Court informed the parties of the juror communications by sealed order\non January 6, 2o22. The Defendant requested the communications, which the Court denied without prejudice. See\nSealed Memo Endorsement, Jan. l3, 2o22. The Defendant nou renews her request on the theory that the\ncommunications could shed light on the identity of the second juror referred to by the New York Times. See\nMaxwell Br. at 2l n.lo; Maxwell Reply at 23 n.l2. Such a request is nothing but unfounded speculation. A juror’s\ncommunication expressing fear about the media reports and the parties’ responses to Juror 5o’s interviews are not\nrelevant to the current inquiry. Nonetheless, in order to ensure a complete record, the Court will transmit under seal\nthe concerned juror’s communications to the parties with the name and contact information of the concerned juror\nredacted in order to protect the juror’s privacy and prevent juror harassment. See Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543. The\nCourt also includes a subsequent communication with the same juror expressing additional concerns so that the\nparties have a complete record of non-logistical juror communications. The Court will file the unredacted\ncommunications under seal for preservation for the appellate record.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l534\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022085.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 23 of 34\n\nMoreover, even where agents from a component of an agency are involved in an\ninvestigation, that does not render the entirety of an agency part of the prosecution team. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Stein, 424 F. Supp. 2d 72o, 723 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo6) (“While the prosecution’s [Rule\nl6] disclosure obligation in some circumstances may extend to materials beyond the knouledge\nof the individual prosecutors assigned to a case, it does not extend to the collective knouledge of\nthe entire United States government or even to the entire government agency concerned.”’); United\nStates v.

Collins, 4o9 F. Supp. 3d 228, 239 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (internal quotation marks and citation\nomited). In determining whether the prosecution has conducted a joint investigation, courts in\nthis district look to a number of non-exhaustive factors, “including whether the other agency: (l)\nparticipated in the prosecution’s witness interviews, (2) was involved in presenting the case to\nthe grand jury, (3) reviewed documents gathered by or shared documents with the prosecution,\n(4) played a role in the <span class=\"highlight\">development</span> of prosecutorial strategy, or (5) accompanied the\nprosecution to court proceedings.” /d. (internal quotation marks and citation omited).\n\nAs under Rule l6, if the Government has represented that it is aware of and has complied\nwith its Brady and Giglio obligations, a defendant must make a “particularized shouing that\nmaterials exist requiring disclosure” in order to sustain a motion to compel. United States v.\nJuliano, No. 99 Cr. ll97, 2ooo WL 64o644, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.

The Court cannot grant a motion to compel the Government to\nproduce a report that, at the time of this order, does not exist.’\n\nAccordingly, Thomas’ motion to compel disclosure of materials related to the Inspector\nGeneral’s investigation is DENIED.\n\nIll. |BOP Materials\n\nThomas also seeks disclosure of “reports generated by investigators within the [BOP]\nregarding” Epstein’s death, and “any and all documents, reports, witness statements and\ndisciplinary records of any and all MCC employees who have engaged in conduct” similar to\nthat alleged against Thomas. Motion at 6. Houever, Thomas has adduced no evidence that the\nGovernment reviewed information arising from a BOP investigation. Nor has he shoun that\nBOP officials “participated in the prosecution’s witness interviews,” were “involved in\npresenting the case to the grand jury,” “reviewed documents gathered by or shared documents\nwith the prosecution,” “played a role in the <span class=\"highlight\">development</span> of prosecutorial strategy,”\n“accompanied the prosecution to court proceedings,” or in any other way played a role in the\ninvestigation that led to the charges against him. Collins, 4o9 F. Supp. 3d at 239 (internal\nquotation marks, citation, and alteration omited). There is, therefore, no evidence that BOP\npersonnel participated in the criminal investigation that led to Thomas’ indictment. Thus, the\nCourt concludes that the BOP was not part of the prosecution team for purposes of Rule l6 and\nBrady.\n\nTo be sure, the BOP is a component of the Department of Justice, but that fact standing\nalone is not sufficient to make the BOP an arm of the prosecution. “The court cannot find that\n' Because the Court denies Thomas’ motion on the ground that no material exists to disclose, it does not address\nwhether the Inspector General’s report might contain information material to his defense, nor whether it ls protected\nby the deliberative process privilege.

The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA. June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”° In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could\n3 State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw enforcement and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities.

She perceived that Menchel was making it clear that she should not “jump the chain of command.”\nMenchel, houever, asserted to OPR that Villafafia had a “history of resisting supervisory authority” that warranted\nhis strong response.\n\n43\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o8l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023086.tif": "D. Acosta Decides on a Resolution That Includes a Two-Year Term of\nIncarceration\n\nThe next critical step in the <span class=\"highlight\">development</span> of the NPA was the decision to propose a two-\nyear term of imprisonment. Although presented to the defense as the “minimum” the USAO would\naccept, in actuality the two-year proposal became only the starting point for the negotiations, with\nthe result that the defense continued to chip away at it as the negotiations continued. The\ncontemporaneous emails make no mention of any rationale for the decision to propose two years\nas the government’s beginning negotiating position, and nobody with whom OPR spoke was able\nto recall hou the decision was made. As discussed belou, Acosta did offer OPR an explanation,\nbut OPR was unable to find contemporaneous evidence supporting it.’°\n\nWhile the defense was communicating its objections to the federal investigation to\nVillafafia, Lourie, Menchel, and Sloman, Villafafia continued moving touard filing charges. On\nJuly l9, 2oo7, the day after receiving Oosterban’s email supporting a potential prosecution,\nVillafafia emailed Lourie and Menchel seeking approval to take further investigative steps\nregarding three of Epstein’s assistants. Houever, Menchel directed Villafafia to “hold off... until\nwe decide what course of action we are going to take on [E]pstein which should happen next\nweek.” Menchel told OPR that he did not specifically recall why he asked Villafafia to wait, but\nhe assumed it was because Acosta was deciding what course of action to take on the case.\n\nOn Monday, July 23, 2oo7, Menchel submited a resignation notice to Acosta, stating that\nhe would be leaving the USAO effective August 6, 2oo7.77\n\nl. The July 26, 2oo7 Meeting in Miami\n\nEarly on the morning of Thursday, July 26, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Menchel that she was\npreparing a new draft indictment containing revisions he had suggested, including removal of all\nbut three of the “travel counts” and “a large number of [the] overt acts,” and the addition of overt\nacts and counts relating to two additional victims; she would not, houever, have the revised\nindictment ready in time “for our discussion today” at their 2:oo p.m. meeting. Menchel told OPR\nthat the fact that he had both proposed revisions to the indictment and also directed Villafafia to\ndelay the investigative steps involving the assistants indicated that he was “trying to do something”\nwith the case, but was waiting for Acosta to decide the “underlying issue” of whether to proceed\nwith federal charges.\n\nAcosta made that decision on or before July 26, 2oo7. On that afternoon, Villafafia met in\nMiami with Menchel. She told OPR that Sloman, as well as the FBI case agents and their\nsupervisors, were also present, with Lourie participating by telephone. Villafafia told OPR that\nshe expected that the meeting, requested by Menchel, would address the direction of the\ninvestigation. Houever, Villafafia told OPR that after everyone had assembled, Menchel entered\nthe room and stated that Acosta “has decided to offer a two-year state deal.” According to\n%6 See Section IV.D.2 in this Part.\n7 As early as May 4, 2oo7, Menchel had informed Acosta that he was intending to leave the USAO to enter\nprivate practice.\n\n48\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o86\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023153.tif": "for up to l2 hours per day, six days per week, to work at the “Florida Science Foundation” office\nin West Palm Beach.'*?

She notified Acosta, Sloman, and the USAO Criminal Division Chief of this <span class=\"highlight\">development</span>\nin an email, and asked, “Can I indict him nou?”\n\nOn November 24, 2oo8, Villafafia sent defense atorney Black a leter, notifying him that\nthe USAO believed Epstein’s application to and participation in the work release program\nconstituted a material breach of the NPA. Villafafia reminded Black that she had “more than a\ndozen e-mails” expressing the USAO’s “insistence” that Epstein be incarcerated for l8 months,\nand that her June 27, 2oo8 leter to counsel made clear that this meant “confinement for twenty-\nfour hours a day.” Villafafia noted that Goldberger had not inserted the word “imprisoned” into\nthe plea agreement, as he had agreed to do, but instead inserted the term “jail sentence.” Villafafia\ntold counsel:\n\nThe [USAO’s] Agreement not to prosecute Mr. Epstein was based\nupon its determination that eighteen months’ incarceration (i.e.,\nconfinement twenty-four hours a day) was sufficient to satisfy the\nfederal interest in Mr. Epstein’s crimes. Accordingly, the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office hereby gives notice that Mr. Epstein has violated\nthe [NPA] by failing to remain incarcerated twenty-four hours a day\nfor the eighteen-month term of imprisonment. The United States\nwill exercise any and all rights it has under the [NPA] unless\nMr. Epstein immediately ceases and desists from his breach of this\nagreement.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, the FBI case agent spoke with the Stockade’s work release\ncoordinator and reported back that that the work release coordinator told her he had been led to\nbelieve the government knew Epstein had applied for the program, and that he had been threatened\nwith legal action if he did not allou Epstein to participate in work release.\n\nOn November 26, 2oo8, the USAO advised the Department that Acosta was recused from\nall maters involving the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, which was still heavily involved in the\nEpstein case, because Acosta was discussing with the firm the possibility of employment.'*? Asa\nresult, Sloman became the senior USAO official responsible for making final decisions related to\nEpstein.\n\nAlso on November 26, 2oo8, Black responded to Villafafia’s leter, acknouledging that\nEpstein was serving his sentence in the Palm Beach County Work Release Program, but denying\nthat Epstein was in breach of the NPA.!®4 Black noted that the NPA did not prohibit work release;\nthe NPA expressly provided that Epstein was to be afforded the same benefits as any other inmate;\nl82 Michele Dargan and David Rogers, “Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ‘treated differently,” Palm\nBeach Daily News, Dec. l3, 2oo8.\n\nl88 The recusal was formally approved by the Department on December 8, 2oo8.\nl84 Black forwarded the email to Sloman, noting that Villafafia “is very concerned about anything Epstein does”\nand that the defense team would “abide by” Sloman’s decision on the issue.\nll5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l53\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023155.tif": "the Sheriff’s Office that Epstein’s duties required him to work six days a week for l2 hours per\nday.

The Sheriff’s Office neither acknouledged nor\nresponded to Villafafia’s leter.\n\nIn March 2oo9, Sloman met in Miami with Dershouitz for, as Dershouitz characterized it\nin a subsequent email, “a relaxed drink and conversation,” which included a discussion of the\nEpstein case. After that encounter, Dershouitz emailed Sloman, expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “assurance that the feds will not interfere with hou the Palm Beach sheriff administers”\nEpstein’s sentence “as long as he is treated like any similarly situated inmate.” Sloman responded:\n\nRegarding Mr. Epstein, the United States Atorney’s Office will not\ninterfere with hou the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office administers the\nsentence imposed by the Court. That being said, this does not mean\nthat the USAO condones or encourages the PBSO to mitigate the\nterms and conditions of his sentence. Furthermore, it does not mean\nthat, if contacted for our position concerning alternative custody or\nin-home detention, we would not object. To be clear, if contacted\nwe will object. Naturally, I also expect that no one on behalf of\nMr. Epstein will use my assurance to you to affirmatively represent\nto PBSO that the USAO does not object to an alternative custody or\nhome detention.\n\nA week later, Dershouitz emailed Sloman again, this time expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “willingness to call the sheriff and advise him that your office would take no position\non hou he handled Epstein’s sentence,” as long as Epstein did not receive special treatment, but\nadding, “[L]et’s put any call off for a while.”\n\nEpstein’s sentence required that he be confined to his home for a l2-month period\nfollouing his release from prison.

POST-RELEASE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nIn the summer of 2oo9, allegations surfaced that Epstein had cooperated with the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York’s investigation of investment bank Bear\nStearns, and that he had been released early from his l8-month imprisonment term because of that\nl85 In Florida, what is commonly referred to as house arrest is actually the Community Control supervision\nprogram.

OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. As a result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconcerning the NPA’s origins and <span class=\"highlight\">development</span>. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nI. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years .. . , registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority. ... [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, l... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l7l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023209.tif": "Notably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.*** In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n24s In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\n246 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the <span class=\"highlight\">development</span> of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the <span class=\"highlight\">development</span> of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023273.tif": "yes.” The court also asked Belohlavek if the juvenile victim’s parents or guardian agreed with the\nplea, and Belohlavek stated that because the victim was no longer under age l8, Belohlavek spoke\nwith the victim’s counsel, who agreed with the plea agreement.*%\n\nBoth Villafafia and the FBI case agent were present in the courtroom gallery to observe the\nplea hearing. Later that day, Villafafia met with Goldberger and gave him the list of 3l individuals\nthe government was prepared to name as victims and to whom the § 2255 provision applied.\n\nIn her 2ol5 CVRA case declaration, Wild stated that, “I did not have any reason to atend\nthat hearing because no one had told me that this guilty plea was related to the FBI’s investigation\nof Epstein’s abuse of me.” She stated that she “would have atended and tried to object to the\njudge and prevent that plea from going forward,” had she knoun that the state plea “had some\nconnection to blocking the prosecution of my case.” Similarly, CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2\nstated that “no one notified me that [Epstein’s] plea had anything to do with my case against him.”\n\nAn atorney who represented several victims, including one whom the state had\nsubpoenaed for the potential July trial, told OPR that he was present in court on June 3o, 2oo8, in\norder to serve a complaint upon Epstein in connection with a civil lawsuit brought on behalf of\none of his clients. The USAO had not informed him about the plea hearing.**4 Moreover, the\natorney informed OPR that, although one of the victims he represented had been interviewed in\nthe PBPD’s investigation and had been deposed by Epstein’s atorneys in the state case (with the\nAssistant State Atorney present), he did not recall receiving any notice of the June 3o, 2oo8 plea\nhearing from the State Atorney’s Office.*® Similarly, another of the victims the state had\nsubpoenaed for the July trial told OPR through her atorney that she received subpoenas from the\nState Atorney’s Office, but she was not invited to or aware of the state plea hearing. Belohlavek\ntold OPR that she did not recall whether she contacted any of the girls to appear at the hearing,\nand she noted that given the charge of solicitation of prostitution, they may not have “technically”\nbeen victims for purposes of notice under Florida law but, rather, witnesses. On July 24, 2oo8, the\nState Atorney’s Office sent leters to two victims stating that the case was closed on June 26, 2oo8\n(although the plea occurred on June 3o, 2oo8) and listed Epstein’s sentence. The leters did not\nmention the NPA or the federal investigation.\n\nXII. SIGNIFICANT POST-PLEA DEVELOPMENTS\nA. Immediately After Epstein’s State Guilty Pleas, Villafaia Notifies Some\nVictims’ Atorneys\n\nVillafafia’s contemporaneous notes shou that immediately after Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\nguilty pleas, she atempted to reach by telephone five atorneys representing various victims in\n363 Villafafia, who was present in court and heard Belohlavek’s representation, told OPR that she had no\ninformation as to whether or hou the state had notified the victims about the plea hearing.\n\n364 Villafafia did contact this atorney’s law partner later that day.\n365 When interviewed by OPR in 2o2o, this same atorney indicated that he was surprised to learn that despite\nthe fact that his client was a minor at the time Epstein victimized her, she was not the minor victim that the state\nidentified in the information charging Epstein.\n235\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23273\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023281.tif": "leters to victims sent after the NPA was signed were not misleading in stating that the mater was\n“under investigation” because the government continued to investigate given its uncertainty that\nEpstein would plead guilty; and (3) Villafafia contacted the petitioners’ atorney prior to Epstein’s\nstate plea to advise him of the hearing. Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR that, while there were\nvalid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is\na case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required. I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [victim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key conclusion that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for resolution after <span class=\"highlight\">development</span> of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\nintention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\nconcluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*°°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, “[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 Guidelines for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]uidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2328l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023295.tif": "and consider victims’ views about, prospective plea negotiations.*’? The “prosecution stage”\nbegan when charges were filed and continued through all post-sentencing legal proceedings.*””\n\nAt the time the parties signed the NPA in September 2oo7, few courts had addressed victim\nstanding under the CVRA. Notably, district courts in New York and South Carolina had ruled that\nstanding atached only upon the filing of federal charges.*°’ Two cases relied upon by the court\nin its February 2ol9 opinion—Dean and its underlying district court opinion, BP Products—were\ndecided after the NPA was signed.\n\nThe CVRA litigation and proposed federal legislation—both pending as of the date of this\nReport—shou that the interpretation of victim standing under the CVRA continues to be a mater\nof debate.*?! In a November 2l, 2ol9 leter to Atorney General William Barr, a Congressional\nRepresentative stated that she had recently introduced legislation specifically to “[c]larify that\nvictims of federal crimes have the right to confer with the Government and be informed about key\npre-charging developments in a case, such as . . . non-prosecution agreements.”4°? The CVRA\nlitigation arising from the Epstein case shous the lack of clarity regarding when CVRA rights\napply: the district court concluded that CVRA rights applied pre-charge, but a sharply divided\npanel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals came to a contrary conclusion, a decision that has\nnou been vacated while the entire court hears the case en banc.\n\nBecause the Supreme Court had not addressed the issue of when CVRA rights apply, the\nlouer courts had reached divergent conclusions, and the Department had concluded that CVRA\nrights did not apply pre-charge, OPR concludes that the subjects’ failure to consult with victims\nbefore signing the NPA did not constitute professional misconduct because at that time, the CVRA\ndid not clearly and unambiguously require prosecutors to consult with victims before the filing of\nfederal criminal charges.*\n\n398 2oo5 Guidelines, Art.

OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the <span class=\"highlight\">development</span>, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23322\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023754.tif": "An atorney may not call an inmate.

Inmates Telephone System (ITS)\nThe Bureau of Prisons extends telephone privileges to inmates as\npart of its overall correctional management strategy. See 28\nC.F.R. $54o.loo, et seg., Subpart I - Telephone Regulations for\nInmate; and Program Statement 5264.o7, Telephone Regulations for\nInmates. Telephone privileges are a supplemental means of\nMaintaining community and family ties that may contribute to an\ninmate's personal <span class=\"highlight\">development</span>. An inmate may request to call a\nperson of his or her choice outside the institution on a\ntelephone provided for that purpose. Houever, limitations and\nconditions may be imposed upon an inmate's telephone privileges\nto ensure adherence to other aspects of the Bureau's correctional\nINManagement responsibilities. In addition to the procedures set\nforth in this subpart, inmate telephone use is subject to those\nlimitations which the Warden determines are necessary to ensure\nthe security or good order, including discipline, of the\ninstitution or to protect the public. Restrictions on inmate\ntelephone use may also be imposed as a disciplinary sanction.\nSee 28 C.F.R. Part 54l.\nInmates must submit a list of numbers they wish to be placed on\ntheir approved telephone list. Inmates can only call numbers\nplaced on their approved telephone list. Once an inmate submits\nthe initial list, it will be processed as soon as possible.\nInmates may submit additional telephone numbers once they are\nassigned a Correctional Counselor or Case Manager from the Unit\nTeam.\nInmates are advised of the institution’s telephone monitoring\ncapability. See 28 C.F.R. $54o,lo2. A notice is posted next to\neach inmate telephone advising that calls are monitored.\nOrdinarily, calls are paid for by the inmate, but in some cases\nthe receiving party pays. See 28 C.F.R. §54o.lo5. Third party,\nconference calls or use of two phones on the same number, or\nother alternative call arrangements are not permited, thus\nlimiting the opportunity for inmates to use the phones for\ncriminal or other inappropriate purposes. Inmates who use the\ntelephone improperly are subject to disciplinary actions which\nmay result in the loss of telephone privileges, and in some cases\ncriminal charges.\nInmates may place atorneys on their approved telephone list.\nHouever, the calls are recorded and subject to monitoring. Such\ncalls are not atorney-client privileged calls. Inmates seeking\natorney-client privileged calls must request an unmonitored\ntelephone call as described above in section B{l).\nPage ll of 22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23754\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023786.jpg": "honor his mchieremenia and acknouledge his Gne exampic.”\nI can help you.\n\nI am nou throuing you a lifesaver.

Farley is currently a visiting professor of applied math-\nematics at the Massachusets Institute of Technology. He graduated summa cum\nlaude from Harvard College with straight A’s in mathematics and later earned\na Ph.D. in mathematics from Oxford University. “Jonathan Farley is one of the\nworld’s most impressive young mathematicians,” said Dr. Counter. “He is a mod-\nel of excellence for young people of all backgrounds, but especially African\nAmericans who may see their intellectual potential in him. Harvard is proud to\nhonor his achievements and acknouledge his fine example.”\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo238l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023820.jpg": "world’s moet impressive poung mathematicians,” said Dr. Counter. “He is a meod-\nel of excellence for young people of all backgrounds, but easpeciolly African\nAmericans who may sec their intellectual potential in him.

Up until that point, we had all been laboring under the assumption this girl had\nalleged multiple sexual encounters with my client. In fact, as you are aware, it was with\nthis in mind that we hired George Slatery, a highly respected polygraph expert, who\nunequivocally confirmed our client’s long held position both that there was no sex and\nthat the girl clearly stated she was l8 years old. Since, we nou knou with certainty that\nthere are in fact no allegations of sex, and no sex occurred between my client and this\ngirl, I would ask you to consider your previous statements to the effect that you would not\nbring a “touching case\" — NO sex, NO charge — in fashioning an appropriate resolution to\nthis mater.\nAs we have discussed many times, the girl’s credibility is highly questionable and\nhas been severely undermined by her actions over the past few months in: (l) repeatedly\nchanging her age on her web page (first l7, then l6, then l5) and posting graphic nude\nand suggestive photographs of herself; (2) boasting about shoplifting, underage drinking,\nBa esene nnicensen nnenst Seumeralion Eovenue, South, Ons Clearlake Cosine, Saite l4oo; Wes Fala: Peach, Soo8\no7/26/l7 Telephone: 56l.659. 3Q), » Fapgimile: 56l.835.869l public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3o469\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00030472.jpg": "RICHARDSON & WEISS, P.A.

Since, we nou knou with certainty that\nthere are in fact no allegations of sex, and no sex occurred between my client and this\ngirl, I would ask you to consider your previous statements to the effect that you would not\nbring a \"touching case\" — NO sex, NO charge — in fashioning an appropriate resolution to\nthis mater.\nAs we have discussed many times, the girl’s credibility is highly questionable and\nhas been severely undermined by her actions over the past few months in: (l) repeatedly\nchanging her age on her web page (first l7, then l6, then l5) and posting graphic nude\nand suggestive photographs of herself; (2) boasting about shoplifting, underage drinking,\no7/26/l7 Telephone: 56l.659.8298 \"5 Baqsamile: 56l.835.869l Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3o472\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00031201.jpg": "Albuquerque Tribune Online Page l of 28\n| [x] Albuquerque Tribune SEARCH ALBUQUERQUE\n| CONTACT US New Mexico, U.S.A.\n\nHELP Cee 2\nCBUBSCRIBE pees a8\n| al\n-TrIg HOME ~|—~ | RICHARDSON'S CAMPAIGN\nion ps CONTRIBUTIONS\nCOB SEARCH\n[IMORTGAGES :\nCronus The top donations to gov. elect Bill\nrime Richardson's campaign came from:\n(OLOTTERY .\nCOPERSONALS l.
