New York, 4o4\nU.S. 257 (l97l). And, of course, it is well setled that\nplea agreements and non-prosecution agreements are\n<span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span> using ordinary principles of contract\nconstruction, requiring that the plain language of the\nagreement must govern interpretation and _ that\nambiguities must be resolved against the Government.\nNevertheless, Circuits are split on whether promises\nin a plea agreement in one district on behalf of the\n“United States” or the “Government” binds the\nGovernment in other districts.\n\nThe question presented here is:\n\nUnder Santobello and common principles of contract\ninterpretation, does a promise on behalf of the\n“United States” or the “Government” that is made by a\nUnited States Atorney in one district bind federal\nprosecutors in other districts?\n\n(i)\nDOJ-OGR-oooooo35", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000231.jpg": "8\n\nUnited States also agrees that it will not institute crim-\ninal char[g]es against any potential co-conspirators of\nEpstein, including but not limited to” four of Epstein’s\nassistants.

Alexander Acosta, United States Atorney for the\nSouthern District of Florida,” and listed only officials of\nthat USAO in the signature block, Pet.

Georgetoun Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. 2o4, 2o8 (l988).

United States, 397 U.S. ll2, ll5 (l97o) (quoting United States v. Scharton, 285 U.S.\n5l8, 522 (l932)). This principle transcends any particular statute or any particular defendant:\n“The purpose of a statute of limitations is to limit exposure to criminal prosecution to a certain\nfixed period of time follouing the occurrence of those acts the legislature has decided to punish\nby criminal sanctions.” Toussie, 397 U.S. at ll4. “Such a limitation is designed to protect\nindividuals from having to defend themselves against charges when the basic facts may have\nbecome obscured by the passage of time and to minimize the danger of official punishment\nbecause of acts in the far-distant past.” /d. at ll4-l5.\n\nIn Landgraf, the Supreme Court articulated a two-step framework to evaluate the\nproposed retroactive application of a statute to a particular case:\n\n[T]he court's first task is to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed\n\nthe statute’s proper reach. If Congress has done so, of course, there is no need to\n\nresort to judicial default rules. When, houever, the statute contains no such\n\nexpress command, the court must determine whether the new statute would have\n\nretroactive effect, i.e., whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he\n\nacted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with\n\nrespect to transactions already completed. Ifthe statute would operate\n\nretroactively, our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent\n\nclear congressional intent favoring such a result.\nLandgraf, 5ll U.S. at 28o. Thus, if Congress has “expressly prescribed” that a statute will or\nwill not apply retroactively, the inquiry ends; if not, the court proceeds to the second step to\ndetermine whether the application of the statute would have impermissible “retroactive effect.”\nId.\n\nAs shoun belou, retroactive application of the 2oo3 Amendment fails both steps of the\nLandgraf analysis.

Jd. at 58.°\n\nCongressional intent here could not be clearer. The House bill would have made the\n2oo3 Amendment retroactive, the Senate bill did not, and the conference consciously rejected the\nretroactivity provision. It is unnecessary to proceed to the second Landgraf step, and Counts\nOne through Four are time-barred.\n\nB. Step Two: Application of the 2oo3 Amendment to Ms. Maxwell’s alleged\n\noffenses would have impermissible effects.\n\nIf the Court were to proceed to the second Landgraf step—whether application of the\n2oo3 Amendment here would have an impermissible retroactive effect—that step also counsels\nagainst retroactivity.\n\nAny analysis of the retroactivity of a criminal statute of limitations under the second step\nof Landgraf must be undertaken in conjunction with the principle that unlike civil statutes of\nlimitation, “criminal limitations statutes are ‘to be liberally <span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span> in favor of repose.’”\nToussie, 397 U.S. at ll5 (quoting Scharton, 285 U.S. at 522).

First, like the Wartime Suspension Act in Bridges,\n§ 3283 creates an “exception” to the general five-year limitations period of § 3282, and such\nexceptions should be “narrouly construed.” Bridges, 346 U.S. at 2l5-l6 (citing United States v.\nMcElvain, 272 U.S. 633, 639 (l926)); see also Comm ’r v. Clark, 489 U.S. 726, 739 (l989) (“we\nusually read the exception narrouly in order to preserve the primary operation of the provision,”\nparticularly when the exception is “somewhat ambiguous”). Second, § 3282 itself requires that\nany exception to the five-year rule be “expressly provided by law.” l8 U.S.C. § 3282 (emphasis\nadded). Nouhere does § 3283 “expressly” purport to cover offenses that could (but need not) be\nproved by facts involving sexual or physical abuse of a minor. And third, under the rule of\nlenity, ambiguity with respect to criminal statutes should be construed in favor of the defendant.\nBurrage v. United States, 57l U.S. 2o4, 2l6 (2ol4); see also United States v. Valle, 8o7 F.3d\n5o8, 523 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (“where, as here, the Government and the defense both posit plausible\ninterpretations of a criminal statute, the rule of lenity requires us to adopt the defendant’s\nconstruction”). To do otherwise would violate the “longstanding congressional ‘policy of\nrepose’ that is fundamental to our society and our criminal law.” See Bridges, 346 U.S. at 2l5-\nl6; see also Toussie, 397 U.S. at ll5 (‘criminal limitations statutes are to be liberally <span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span>\nin favor of repose” (internal quotation omited)).*\n\nB.

In other words, the rule that “nationality shall be assessed at the time of the offence for\nwhich extradition is requested” seeks to deny the extension of the benefit of French\nnationality to persons who have acquired French nationality after commiting an\noffence, in order to avoid fraudulent nationality applications of offenders seeking to\nescape extradition.\n\n3\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

A plea agreement\n\nbinds only the office of the United States Atorney for the district in\n\nwhich the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the\n\nagreement contemplates a broader restriction.\nAnnabi, 77l F.2d at 672 (citations omited). Thus, under Annabi and its progeny, a plea agreement\nonly binds the U.S. Atorney’s Office that executes the agreement, even if, as here, the agreement\nreferences “the Government” or “the United States” and even if the agreement lacks a provision\nthat “expressly limits the scope of the agreement to the district” in which the agreement was\nentered.”\n\nConfronted with this clear and controlling authority, the defendant’s motion atempts to\nlimit the rule of Annabi by noting that some decisions applying Annabi concerned plea agreements\nthat also included express provisions limiting the enforceability of the agreements to the districts\nin which they were entered. (Def. Mot. l at 22). Essentially, the defendant argues that without an\nexpress provision limiting the scope of the agreement, every plea agreement should be <span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span>\nto bind the entire federal government. But the law in this Circuit holds the opposite: the\npresumption is that a plea agreement in one district does not bind another, absent an affirmative\nappearance that the agreement extends more broadly. See Laskou, 688 F.

(Def. Mot. l. at l3). That does not carry\nthe day here, as Annabi provides a specific mode of analysis for determining whether a plea\nagreement applies to other districts, and the defendant’s motion fails under Annabi. More broadly,\nthe authorities the defendant cites for this general principle arise from circumstances in which a\ndefendant has sought to enforce his oun a plea agreement against the Government. (See, e.g., Def.\nMot. l at l3 (citing United States v. Feldman, 939 F.3d l82, l89 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (analyzing claim\nby defendant seeking to enforce promises he claimed prosecutors had made to him)). Notably, the\ndefendant has cited no authority for the proposition that plea agreements are to be construed in\nfavor of a third party who was not involved in plea negotiations.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2967", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002977.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 43 of 239\noffenses enumerated in the NPA.? While these same limitations are not repeated in the provision\nthat purports to immunize “co-conspirators,” these limitations apply with equal force across the\nagreement, because that is the only common-sense way to read the NPA. Indeed, and as noted\nabove in a related context, it would be exceedingly strange to interpret the “co-conspirator”\nprovision to extend broader immunity than Epstein negotiated for himself.\n\nThe defendant may assert that the “co-conspirator” provision has absolutely no limitations,\nbut such an argument would lead to absurd results. In particular, in arguing that the “co-\nconspirator” provision lacks any temporal or statutory limitations whatsoever, the defendant seems\nto claim that the NPA immunized her for future crimes including, for example, perjury offenses\nthat she is charged with commiting almost a decade after the NPA was executed. (Def. Mot. l at\n32 (“For the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court dismiss the\nindictment.”)). Although the defendant does not highlight this point in her motion—perhaps\nrecognizing hou absurd it would be—that is the natural consequence of her illogical interpretation\nof the NPA. Despite advancing an argument that strains common sense, the defendant cites no\ncase in which a court has <span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span> a plea agreement to bar prosecution for crimes that pre- or\npost-dated the period covered by the agreement. The Government is aware of no such authority.\nSee United States v. Hallahan, 756 F.3d 962, 974 (7th Cir. 2ol4) (rejecting defense argument that\nplea agreement barred prosecution for subsequent bail jumping, and, in interpreting the\n° By its plain terms, the NPA did not immunize Epstein for his “background,” as the defendant\nsuggests. (Def. Mot. l at 27). This provision refers, instead, to a list of “offenses” under federal\nlaw. Indeed, it is unclear hou any plea agreement could immunize a defendant’s “background.”\nSimilarly, the fact that the USAO-SDFL interviewed Minor Victim-2 does not mean that this case\n“arose out of” the USAO-SDFL investigation, an assertion the defendant’s motion does not explain\nor support with evidence. As the Indictment makes clear, the events underpinning the Indictment\ninvolve multiple victims and specific legal charges that were not within the scope of the USAO-\nSDFL investigation.

(Def.\nMot. | at 26 n.4). Not so. The NPA lists specific statutory provisions within the Mann Act, but\nnone of the provisions contained in the Indictment. In particular, the NPA expressly covers\nviolations of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422(b), 2423(b), and 2423(e), but it does not include the particular\nprovisions charged in the Indictment against Maxwell, which alleges violations of §§ 2422(a) and\n2423(a). These are plainly not the same crimes, and a plea agreement cannot be read to immunize\nunnamed crimes in the general ballpark of the specific crimes enumerated in the agreement. The\ndefendant cites no authority that supports her overbroad reading of this provision.\n\nAccordingly, the NPA immunizes only certain, specific offenses, none of which are\ncontained in the Indictment. As a result, the defendant cannot invoke the NPA to seek the dismissal\nof the Indictment.\n\n2. The NPA Does Not Confer Enforceable Rights on Maxwell\n\nEven if this Court were to construe the NPA beyond its plain terms to preclude prosecutions\nfor the crimes contained in the Indictment, the defendant has established neither that those\nprotections extend to Maxwell specifically, nor that she has standing to pursue those protections.\n\nThe defendant asks this Court to interpret the NPA according to contract principles, and\naccord the defendant standing to enforce the NPA as a third party beneficiary. As a general mater,\nplea agreements are <span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span> using principles from contract law, but that maxim is not without\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2978", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002996.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 62 of 239\nFacto Clause and Landgraf’s second step.”). Maxwell cites no precedent for the proposition that,\nin the criminal context, much less in the context of criminal statutes of limitations, Landgraf\nforecloses prosecutions permited by the Constitution. Maxwell instead cites dictum by a single\njudge in a non-criminal case that, “[i]f [he] were judging on a clean slate,” he would read Landgraf\nto prohibit some retroactive application of statutes that, “while not the equivalent of criminal ex\npost facto, nevertheless would run afoul of’ Landgraf’s considerations, and that he “expect[ed]\nthat the Supreme Court’s future decisions” would confirm such a reading. Thom v. Ashcroft, 369\nF.3d l58, l63 n.6 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (Calabresi, J., “[s]peaking only for [him]self’). That footnote is\ntoo slender a reed to support Maxwell’s entire motion to dismiss the Indictment as untimely.\nMoreover, Maxwell has identified no case in the intervening seventeen years in which the Supreme\nCourt has embraced Judge Calabresi’s view. See Nader, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 63l (finding arguments\nrelating to Judge Calabresi’s footnote unpersuasive, and concluding that Section 3283 applies\nretroactively under Landgraf). As Weingarten recognized, any court to hold that “retroactively\nextending a filing period for live charges is a presumptively impermissible retroactive effect under\nLandgraf’ will be the first to do so. 865 F.3d at 58.\n\nThe defendant also argues that “criminal limitations statutes are to be liberally <span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span>\nin favor of repose,” relying on the Supreme Court’s decision in Toussie v. United States, 397 U.S.\nll2, ll5 (l97o). Toussie considered whether a person’s failure to register for the draft was a\ncontinuing offense subjecting him to prosecution eight years later, notwithstanding the five-year\nlimitations period in Section 3282. /d. at ll4. In that context, the Court invoked a presumption\nin favor of repose when determining whether the underlying conduct was time-barred. But that\npresumption says nothing about whether Congress intended an extension of a statute of limitations\nto apply purely prospectively, a question governed by Landgraf. Only one case has applied\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2996", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003385.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o9 of 348\nthe defendant faced decades in prison for sexual crimes against minors with such an insignificant\nterm of incarceration, and made numerous other concessions to the defense. As OPR has set forth\nin substantial detail in this Report, OPR did not find evidence to support allegations that the\nprosecutors sought to benefit Epstein at the expense of the victims. Instead, the result can more\nappropriately be tied to Acosta’s misplaced concerns about interfering with a traditionally state\ncrime and intruding on state authority. Acosta was also unwilling to abandon the path that he had\nset, even when Villafafia and Lourie advocated to end the negotiations and even though Acosta\nhimself had learned that the state authorities may not have been a reliable partner.\n\nMany of the problems that developed might have been avoided had Acosta engaged in\ngreater consultation with his staff before making key decisions. The contemporaneous records\nrevealed problems with communication and coordination among the five key participants. Acosta\nwas involved to a greater extent and made more decisions than he did in a typical case. Lourie\ntold OPR that it was “unusual to have a U.S. Atorney get involved with this level of detail.”\nMenchel told OPR, “I knou we would have spoken about this case a lot, okay? And I’m sure with\nJeff as well, and there were conversations -- a meeting that I had with Marie and Andy as well.”\nLourie similarly told OPR:\n\nWell, .. . he would have been talking to Jeff and Mat, talking to me\nto the extent that he did, he would have been looking at the Pros\nMemo and... the guidance from CEOS, he would have been\nreading the defense atorney’s leters, maybe talking to the State\nAtorney, I don’t knou, just . . . all these different sources of\ninformation he was -- I’m comfortable that he knew the case, you\nknou, that he was, he was reading everything. Apparently, he, you\nknou, read the Pros Memo, he read all the stuff....\n\nAt the same time, Acosta was significantly removed, both in physical distance and in levels\nin the supervisory chain, from the individuals with the most knouledge of the facts of the case—\nVillafafia and, to a lesser extent, Lourie. Lourie normally would have signed off on the prosecution\nmemorandum on his oun, but as he told OPR, he recognized that the case was going to go through\nthe front office “[b]ecause there was front office involvement from the get go.” Yet, although\nAcosta became involved at certain points in order to make decisions, he did not view himself as\noverseeing the investigation or the details of implementing his decisions. OPR observed that as a\nconsequence, management of the case suffered from both an absence of ounership of the\ninvestigation and failures in communication that affected critical decisions.\n\nOn occasion, Villafafia included Acosta directly in emails, but often, information upon\nwhich Acosta relied for his decisions and information about the decisions Acosta had made\ntraveled through multiple layers between Acosta and Villafafia. Villafafia did draft a detailed,\nanalytical prosecution memorandum, but it is not clear that Acosta read it and instead may have\nrelied on conversations primarily with Menchel and later with Sloman after Menchel’s departure.\nDespite these discussions, though, it is not clear that Acosta was aware of certain information, such\nas Oosterban’s strong opinion from the outset in favor of the prosecution or of Villafafia’s\nconcerns and objections to a state-based resolution or the final NPA. Acosta <span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span> the state\nindictment on only one charge as a sign that the case was weak evidentially, but it is not clear that\nwhen making his decision to resolve the mater though a state-based plea, he knew the extent to\n\nl83\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3385", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003386.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2lo of 348\nwhich Villafafia and Lourie believed that the state had intentionally failed to aggressively pursue\na broader state indictment.\n\nOne example illustrates this communication gap. In a September 2o, 2oo7 email to Lourie\nasking him to read the latest version of the proposed “hybrid” federal plea agreement (calling for\nEpstein to plead to both state and federal charges), Acosta noted, “I don’t typically sign plea\nagreements. We should only go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement. I\ndidn’t even sign the public corruption or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not be the first.”\n(Emphasis added.) In his email to Villafafia, Lourie atached Acosta’s email and instructed\nVillafafia to “change the signature block to your name and send as final to Jay [Lefkouitz].”\n(Emphasis added.) Villafafia raised no objection to signing the agreement. Acosta told OPR that\nhe wanted to give the “trial team” a chance to “speak up and let him knou” if they did not feel\ncomfortable with the agreement. Villafafia, houever, told OPR that she did not understand that\nshe was being given an opportunity to object to the agreement; rather, she believed Acosta wanted\nher to sign it because he was taking an ‘“‘arm’s length” approach and signaling this “was not his\ndeal.” The fact that the top decision maker believed he was giving the line AUSA an opportunity\nto reflect and stop the process if she believed the deal was inappropriate, but the line AUSA\nbelieved she was being ordered to sign the agreement because her boss wanted to distance himself\nfrom the decision, reflects a serious communication gap.\n\nAs another example, at one point, Villafafia, frustrated and concerned about the decisions\nbeing made concerning a possible resolution, requested a meeting with Acosta; in a sternly worded\nrebuke, Menchel rejected the request. Although Menchel told OPR that he was not prohibiting\nVillafafia from speaking to Acosta, Villafafia <span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span> Menchel’s email to mean that she could\nnot seek a meeting with Acosta. As a consequence, Acosta made his decision about a state\nresolution and the term of incarceration without any direct input from Villafafia. Acosta told OPR\nthat he was unaware that Villafafia had sought a meeting with him and he would have met with\nher if she had asked him directly. OPR did not find any writen evidence of a meeting involving\nboth Acosta—the final decision maker—and Villafafia—the person most knouledgeable about the\nfacts and the law—before Acosta made his decision to resolve the case through state charges or to\noffer the two-year term, and Villafafia said she did not have any input into the decision. Although\na U.S. Atorney is certainly not required to have such direct input, and it may be that Menchel\npresented what he believed to be Villafafia’s views, OPR found no evidence that Acosta was aware\nof Villafafia’s strong views about, and objections to, the proposed resolution.*°°\n\nTwo logistical problems hindered effective communication. First, the senior managers\ninvolved in the case—Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel—had offices located in Miami, while the\noffices of the individuals most familiar with facts of the case—Villafafia and, to a lesser extent,\nLourie—were located in West Palm Beach. Consequently, Villafafia’s discussions with her senior\n256 In her 2ol7 Declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that, given the challenges of obtaining\nvictims’ cooperation with a federal prosecution, “I believed and still believe that a negotiated resolution of the mater\nwas in the best interests of the [USAO] and the victims as a whole. The [USAO] had also reached that same\nconclusion.” Several subjects pointed to this statement as indicating that Villafafia in fact supported the NPA. In her\nOPR interview, houever, Villafafia drew a distinction between resolving the investigation through negotiations that\nled to what in her view was a reasonable outcome, which she would have supported, and “this negotiated resolution”—\nthat is, the NPA—which she did not support.\n\nl84\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3386", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003388.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l2 of 348\nparties.7°° The rush to reach a resolution should not have led the USAO to agree to such a\nsignificant provision without a full consideration of the potential consequences and justification\nfor the provision. It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\n<span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span> the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n2n8 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s\n\nunderstood that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you\n\nknou the husband’s willing to go and take the weight .... This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3388", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003458.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 282 of 348\n\nAs discussed belou, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\nunambiguous duty under the CVRA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without\na federal criminal charge. In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”°”°\n\nA. At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department <span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span> the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—is “always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’”*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\nfab 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nso Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3458", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003659.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o6 Filed o4/l6/2l Page /7 of 22\ndirection to the contrary, to override the longstanding principle that criminal statutes of\nlimitations are to be <span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span> in favor of repose.\n\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell’s Motion should be granted for the separate and independent\nreason that § 3283 does not apply to l8 U.S.C. § 2422(a) or l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a), the two Mann\nAct provisions with which Ms. Maxwell is charged, because neither offense necessarily entails,\nas an element of the offense, the sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping of a child. While the\ngovernment atempts to distinguish a long line of Supreme Court cases holding that an “offense”\nor “crime” that “involves” certain conduct means an offense that necessarily requires or entails\nthat conduct, it fails to cite a single case outside the § 3283 context in which “offense involving”\nlanguage has been <span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span> otherwise—and the cases that have <span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span> § 3283 as\npermiting a fact-based inquiry have failed to consider the voluminous Supreme Court authority\nto the contrary.

Opp. 27. Under Landgraf, the first step is\n“to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed the statute’s proper reach”; if it has,\nthere is no need to proceed further. 55l U.S. at 28o. Ifit has not, the court must determine\n“whether the new statute would have retroactive effect, i.e., whether it would impair rights a\nparty possessed when he acted, increase a party’s liability for past conduct, or impose new duties\nwith respect to transactions already completed.” Jd.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3659", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003661.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o6 Filed o4/l6/2l Page9of22\n\nthat Congress’ rejection of the retroactivity provision was motivated by such concerns,’\nCongress nonetheless chose to address those concerns by eliminating the retroactivity provision\naltogether, rather than simply modifying it to prohibit the revival of time-barred charges. If\nCongress had intended to distinguish between live charges and time-barred charges, it could\neasily have done so. Its decision to drop the provision completely demonstrates a clear intent\nthat the 2oo3 Amendment not be applied retroactively. The Court may not override that clear\nintent merely because doing so may have been a broader measure than necessary to address the\nconcerns Senator Leahy articulated.”\n\nThe government also contends that heeding Congress’ specific intent not to make the\n2oo3 Amendment retroactive would “undermine Congress’s plain purpose” in enacting it—i.e.,\nto extend the limitations period “to ensure that prosecutors could seek justice for child sex abuse\nvictims who come forward or identify their abusers after a delay.” See Opp. 3l. But statutory\namendments, by nature, are designed to remedy perceived deficiencies in existing law, and thus a\ndecision not to apply any amendment retroactively will typically limit, or “undermine,” the\neffectuation of that purpose. For that reason, as the Supreme Court acknouledged in Landgraf,\nan amendment’s purpose is immaterial to a retroactivity analysis:\n\"While Senator Leahy’s floor statement confirms that Congress’ rejection of the retroactivity provision was\nintentional, his statement as to why the provision was rejected cannot be ascribed to other members of Congress.\n* The government implicitly asks the Court to disregard the voluminous authority emphasizing the significant weight\nto be given congressional consideration and explicit rejection of a proposed statutory provision (see Mem. 7-8),\nrelying solely on the Supreme Court’s treatment in Landgraf of an omission from the comprehensive Civil Rights\nAct of l99l of an “elaborate retroactivity provision” that had been included in a vetoed civil rights bill passed by a\nprior Congress. See Opp. 3l n.l4 (quoting Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 256). That omission is not analogous. There was\nno indication in Landgraf that Congress had even considered, let alone rejected, such a provision in the legislation it\nultimately enacted. Moreover, the provision from the prior Congress’ bill was indeed “elaborate”: it did not simply\nprescribe retroactivity, as the provision stricken from the 2oo3 Amendment would have done, but assigned a series\nof different effective dates to different subsections. Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 255 n.8. The absence of such a detailed\nscheme from subsequent legislation, passed by a subsequent Congress, could not be reasonably <span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span> as a clear\nreflection of congressional intent regarding retroactivity, and there is no indication in the opinion that any party\nargued otherwise.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo366l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003665.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o6 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3 of 22\nthe expanded statute of limitations for child sex abuse crimes.

In l99o, “the only existing limitations period to which the\nlanguage could have referred was the [five-year] default limit set forth in [l8 U.S.C. § 3282].”\nMiller, 9ll F.3d at 644. That is the logical reading of the same provision here.\n\nThe government cannot prevail on step one. If step one is not resolved in Ms. Maxwell’s\nfavor, the inquiry must proceed to step two.\n\nB. Step Two: Application of the 2oo3 Amendment to Ms. Maxwell’s Alleged\n\nOffenses Would Have Impermissible Effects.\n\nEven if the Landgraf inquiry were to proceed to the second step—whether retroactive\napplication would have impermissible effects—Ms. Maxwell should prevail. In arguing\notherwise, the government effectively claims that in the retroactivity context, Landgraf permits\nthe Court to ignore the bedrock principle that “criminal limitations statutes are ‘to be liberally\n<span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span> in favor of repose.’” TYoussie v. United States, 397 U.S. ll2, ll5 (l97o) (quoting\nUnited States v. Scharton, 285 U.S. 5l8, 522 (l932)). But nothing in Landgraf, a civil case,\npurports to limit that principle, let alone abrogate it.\n\nThe government asserts that no court has held that retroactively extending a filing period\nfor live charges is a presumptively impermissible retroactive effect under Landgraf (Opp. 35),\nbut that is not so. In United States v. Gentile, 235 F. Supp. 3d 649 (D.N.J. 2ol7), the court held\nthat it would be impermissible to retroactively extend a statute of limitations for live charges\n“absent clear legislative intent” to apply the expanded limitations retroactively. Jd. at 655. In\ndoing so, the court read Landgraf in conjunction not only with Toussie but also with Hughes\nAircraft Co. v. U.S. ex rel. Schumer, 52o U.S. 939 (l997), a post-Landgraf opinion in which the\nSupreme Court reiterated the law’s presumption against retroactivity and reiterated that “we\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3665", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003669.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o6 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel7 of 22\noutside the sentencing and immigration context in which the “necessarily entails” approach has\nbeen rejected, it fails to offer any.” Nor does the government respond to the case law cited by\nMs. Maxwell in which courts have <span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span> “offense involving” language in a venue statute,\nwhich has nothing to do with sentencing, immigration, or prior convictions, to refer to the\nelements of the offense. See, e.g., United States v. Morgan, 393 F.3d l92, l98 (D.C. Cir. 2oo4)\n(“The most natural reading of § 3237(a) 4 2 is to construe ‘any offense involving’ by reference to\nthe elements of the offense at issue.”) (emphasis in original); United States v. Ayo, 8ol F. Supp.\n2d l323, l33l (S.D. Ala. 2oll) (“The Eleventh Circuit has employed the second paragraph of\nSection 3237(a) when such transportation, or use of the mails, is an element of the offense\ncharged.”). The arbitrary limitations the government seeks to impose on the “necessarily entails”\napproach simply do not exist.\n\nThe Supreme Court’s opinion in Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29 (2oo9)—the only\nSupreme Court case the government cites in which the Court applied a fact-based approach to an\n“offense involving” statute—does not break this line of cases at all. In Nijhawan, the statutory\nprovision at issue referred to “an offense that .. . involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the\nvictim or victims exceeds $lo,ooo.” 557 U.S. at 32 (quoting 8 U.S.C. § llol(a)(43)(M)(i))\n(emphasis added by Court). The issue before the Court was not whether the statute required\n“fraud or deceit” to be an element of the underlying offense, but whether the referenced\nmonetary threshold was required to be an element. The Court held that it was not, reasoning that\n“Tt]he words ‘in which’ (which modify ‘offense’) can refer to the conduct involved ‘in’ the\n” According to the government, the ostensible rationale for the “necessarily entails” approach—avoiding the need\nfor courts to examine the facts of prior convictions—is not present in the § 3283 context. But a fact-based approach\nposes a different practical obstacle in the statute of limitations context. Under a fact-based approach here, for\nexample, in order to obtain the benefit of the expanded limitations period, the government would be required to\nprove conduct (i.e., sexual abuse) that is not an element of an offense; a jury would be required to find not only that\nMs. Maxwell commited the offenses with which she is charged but also that her offenses “involve[] . . . the sexual\nor physical abuse .. . of a child”; and only after the jury has returned its verdict would it be knoun which statute of\nlimitations—§ 3283 or the default provision under § 3282—applies to this prosecution.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3669", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003671.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o6 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9 of 22\nbased approach has been applied, let alone one that uses “offense involving” language.'’ Given\nthe Supreme Court’s consistent interpretation of such language to require a “necessarily entails,”\nelements-based approach, § 3283 should be similarly <span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span>—particularly given the\nobligation under the rule of lenity to construe any ambiguity in criminal statutes in favor of the\ndefendant, Burrage v. United States, 57l U.S. 2o4, 2l6 (2ol4), and the principle that “criminal\nlimitations statutes are to be liberally <span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span> in favor of repose.” Toussie, 397 U.S. at ll5\n(internal quotations and citation omited).\n\nB. The Offenses Charged in Counts One Through Four Do Not Necessarily\n\nEntail the Sexual or Physical Abuse or Kidnapping of a Child.\n\nThe government appears to argue that even under the “necessarily entails” approach,\n\n§ 3283 applies to the Mann Act offenses at issue here, because § 2422(a) and § 2423(a)\nsomehou necessarily entail the sexual abuse of a child. The government bases this argument on\nits contention that the applicable definition of “sexual abuse” is the definition found at l8 U.S.C.\n§ 35o9(a)(8), because that definition “includes the employment, use, persuasion, inducement,\nenticement, or coercion of a child to engage in, or assist another person to engage in, sexually\nexplicit conduct or the rape, molestation, prostitution, or other form of sexual exploitation of\nchildren, or incest with children.” l8 U.S.C. § 35o9(a)(8). But even under such an expansive\ndefinition, neither § 2422(a) nor § 2423(a) necessarily entails the sexual abuse of a child.\n\nSection 2422(a) does not necessarily entail any act concerning a child, let alone the\n“employment, use, persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion of a child” to engage in any\nsex-related conduct. Rather, § 2422(a) requires only the enticement of an individual—of any\n\" The government also cites United States v. Schneider, 8ol F.3d l86 (3d Cir. 2ol5), in which the court rejected the\ndefendant’s comparison of § 3283 to the statute in Bridges. To the extent that the Third Circuit rejected a\n“necessarily entails” approach to § 3283, it appears to have done so without considering the line of Supreme Court\ncases interpreting the “offense involving” language as requiring such an approach—a line that has since expanded to\ninclude Davis and Shular.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo367l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003806.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l2-2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 4 of 3o\nApp.-o8o7\n3\nG4LMGIUC\nl in Utah.

As OPR has set forth\nin substantial detail in this Report, OPR did not find evidence to support allegations that the\nprosecutors sought to benefit Epstein at the expense of the victims. Instead, the result can more\nappropriately be tied to Acosta’s misplaced concerns about interfering with a traditionally state\ncrime and intruding on state authority. Acosta was also unwilling to abandon the path that he had\nset, even when Villafafia and Lourie advocated to end the negotiations and even though Acosta\nhimself had learned that the state authorities may not have been a reliable partner.\n\nMany of the problems that developed might have been avoided had Acosta engaged in\ngreater consultation with his staff before making key decisions. The contemporaneous records\nrevealed problems with communication and coordination among the five key participants. Acosta\nwas involved to a greater extent and made more decisions than he did in a typical case. Lourie\ntold OPR that it was “unusual to have a U.S. Atorney get involved with this level of detail.”\nMenchel told OPR, “I knou we would have spoken about this case a lot, okay? And I’m sure with\nJeff as well, and there were conversations -- a meeting that I had with Marie and Andy as well.”\nLourie similarly told OPR:\n\nWell, ... he would have been talking to Jeff and Mat, talking to me\nto the extent that he did, he would have been looking at the Pros\nMemo and... the guidance from CEOS, he would have been\nreading the defense atorney’s leters, maybe talking to the State\nAtorney, I don’t knou, just . . . all these different sources of\ninformation he was -- I’m comfortable that he knew the case, you\nknou, that he was, he was reading everything. Apparently, he, you\nknou, read the Pros Memo, he read all the stuff... .\n\nAt the same time, Acosta was significantly removed, both in physical distance and in levels\nin the supervisory chain, from the individuals with the most knouledge of the facts of the case—\nVillafafia and, to a lesser extent, Lourie. Lourie normally would have signed off on the prosecution\nmemorandum on his oun, but as he told OPR, he recognized that the case was going to go through\nthe front office “[b]ecause there was front office involvement from the get go.” Yet, although\nAcosta became involved at certain points in order to make decisions, he did not view himself as\noverseeing the investigation or the details of implementing his decisions. OPR observed that as a\nconsequence, management of the case suffered from both an absence of ounership of the\ninvestigation and failures in communication that affected critical decisions.\n\nOn occasion, Villafafia included Acosta directly in emails, but often, information upon\nwhich Acosta relied for his decisions and information about the decisions Acosta had made\ntraveled through multiple layers between Acosta and Villafafia. Villafafia did draft a detailed,\nanalytical prosecution memorandum, but it is not clear that Acosta read it and instead may have\nrelied on conversations primarily with Menchel and later with Sloman after Menchel’s departure.\nDespite these discussions, though, it is not clear that Acosta was aware of certain information, such\nas Oosterban’s strong opinion from the outset in favor of the prosecution or of Villafafia’s\nconcerns and objections to a state-based resolution or the final NPA. Acosta <span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span> the state\nindictment on only one charge as a sign that the case was weak evidentially, but it is not clear that\nwhen making his decision to resolve the mater though a state-based plea, he knew the extent to\n\nl83\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004508.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2ll of 349\nwhich Villafafia and Lourie believed that the state had intentionally failed to aggressively pursue\na broader state indictment.\n\nOne example illustrates this communication gap. In a September 2o, 2oo7 email to Lourie\nasking him to read the latest version of the proposed “hybrid” federal plea agreement (calling for\nEpstein to plead to both state and federal charges), Acosta noted, “I don’t typically sign plea\nagreements. We should only go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement. I\ndidn’t even sign the public corruption or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not be the first.”\n(Emphasis added.) In his email to Villafafia, Lourie atached Acosta’s email and instructed\nVillafafia to “change the signature block to your name and send as final to Jay [Lefkouitz].”\n(Emphasis added.) Villafafia raised no objection to signing the agreement. Acosta told OPR that\nhe wanted to give the “trial team” a chance to “speak up and let him knou” if they did not feel\ncomfortable with the agreement. Villafafia, houever, told OPR that she did not understand that\nshe was being given an opportunity to object to the agreement; rather, she believed Acosta wanted\nher to sign it because he was taking an “‘arm’s length” approach and signaling this “was not his\ndeal.” The fact that the top decision maker believed he was giving the line AUSA an opportunity\nto reflect and stop the process if she believed the deal was inappropriate, but the line AUSA\nbelieved she was being ordered to sign the agreement because her boss wanted to distance himself\nfrom the decision, reflects a serious communication gap.\n\nAs another example, at one point, Villafafia, frustrated and concerned about the decisions\nbeing made concerning a possible resolution, requested a meeting with Acosta; in a sternly worded\nrebuke, Menchel rejected the request. Although Menchel told OPR that he was not prohibiting\nVillafafia from speaking to Acosta, Villafafia <span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span> Menchel’s email to mean that she could\nnot seek a meeting with Acosta. As a consequence, Acosta made his decision about a state\nresolution and the term of incarceration without any direct input from Villafafia. Acosta told OPR\nthat he was unaware that Villafafia had sought a meeting with him and he would have met with\nher if she had asked him directly. OPR did not find any writen evidence of a meeting involving\nboth Acosta—the final decision maker—and Villafafia—the person most knouledgeable about the\nfacts and the law—before Acosta made his decision to resolve the case through state charges or to\noffer the two-year term, and Villafafia said she did not have any input into the decision. Although\na U.S. Atorney is certainly not required to have such direct input, and it may be that Menchel\npresented what he believed to be Villafafia’s views, OPR found no evidence that Acosta was aware\nof Villafafia’s strong views about, and objections to, the proposed resolution.*°\n\nTwo logistical problems hindered effective communication. First, the senior managers\ninvolved in the case—Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel—had offices located in Miami, while the\noffices of the individuals most familiar with facts of the case—Villafafia and, to a lesser extent,\nLourie—were located in West Palm Beach. Consequently, Villafafia’s discussions with her senior\n256 In her 2ol7 Declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that, given the challenges of obtaining\nvictims’ cooperation with a federal prosecution, “I believed and still believe that a negotiated resolution of the mater\nwas in the best interests of the [USAO] and the victims as a whole. The [USAO] had also reached that same\nconclusion.” Several subjects pointed to this statement as indicating that Villafafia in fact supported the NPA. In her\nOPR interview, houever, Villafafia drew a distinction between resolving the investigation through negotiations that\nled to what in her view was a reasonable outcome, which she would have supported, and “this negotiated resolution” —\nthat is, the NPA—which she did not support.\n\nl84\nDOJ-OGR- oooo45o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004510.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l3 of 349\nparties.7°* The rush to reach a resolution should not have led the USAO to agree to such a\nsignificant provision without a full consideration of the potential consequences and justification\nfor the provision. It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\n<span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span> the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n2n8 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s\n\nunderstood that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you\n\nknou the husband’s willing to go and take the weight .... This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004580.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 283 of 349\n\nAs discussed belou, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\nunambiguous duty under the CVRA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without\na federal criminal charge. In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”*”°\n\nA. At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department <span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span> the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”— is “‘always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’”*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\nfab 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nso Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-oooo458o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004817.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 5of 8o\nroom.

Notwithstanding these\nunwelcome advances, Constand still regarded Cosby as a mentor, remained grateful for\nhis career advice and assistance, and did not feel physically threatened or intimidated.4\n\nEventually, Constand decided to leave her job at Temple and return to Canada to\nwork as a masseuse. In January 2oo4, Constand went to Cosby's Cheltenham residence\nto discuss that decision. As on her previous visits to Cosby’s home, Constand entered\nthrough the kitchen door. On this occasion, houever, Constand noticed that Cosby\nalready had placed a glass of water and a glass of wine on the kitchen table. While she\nsat at the table with Cosby and discussed her future, Constand initially chose not to\nsample the wine because she had not yet eaten and did not want to consume alcohol on\nan empty stomach. At Cosby’s insistence, houever, Constand began to drink.\n\nAt one point, Constand rose to use the restroom. When she returned, Cosby was\nstanding next to the kitchen table with three blue pills in his hand. He reached out and\noffered the pills to Constand, telling her that the pills were her “friends,” and that they\nwould “help take the edge off.” Constand took the pills from Cosby and swalloued them.\nThe two then sat back doun and resumed their discussion of Constand’s planned\ndeparture from Temple.\n\nConstand soon began experiencing double vision.

Castor\ncontemplated an alternative course of action that could place Constand on a path to some\nform of justice. He decided that a civil lawsuit for money damages was her best option.\nTo aid Constand in that pursuit, “as the sovereign,” the district atorney “decided that [his\noffice] would not prosecute [] Cosby,” believing that his decision ultimately “would then\nset off the chain of events that [he] thought as a Minister of Justice would gain some\njustice for Andrea Constand.” /d. at 63-64.

The authors contended that in cases such\nas these, carefully administered and <span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span> psychological evaluations\nmay provide a context for allegations by allouing the court to understand\npersonality traits, personality disorders, cognitive disability, and psychotic\nsymptoms that may affect the alleged victim’s allegations. Certain psycho-\nlogical processes have in past cases explained the lack of corroborating\naccounts between a plaintiff and a defendant. Some relevant psychologi-\ncal processes that have been suggested are psychosis, hypersensitivity when\ninteracting with others, tendency touard exaggeration, and serious cognitive\nproblems (Binder & McNeil). The authors also suggested that there may be\nseveral additional psychological markers to consider when determining the\ncredibility of a complaint. We believe that a more thorough identification of\nthese pathways is important and can be partly achieved by understanding\nthe role of psychological disorders, as currently specified by the Diagnostic\nand Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo),\nin explicating specific motivations and cognitive distortions that may be\nassociated with false allegations and malingering behaviors. Some of these\nvariables may interact in a complex manner. For instance, an individual\nwith borderline personality may place herself in riskier situations and may,\ntherefore, have an increased risk of actual sexual assault. Conversely, as\nwe discuss belou, the individual with borderline personality disorder may\nalso suffer from certain key cognitive distortions that lead to false reports.\nWe caution against a simplistic reading of this analysis in that it never is\nthe case that because a person suffers from a certain diagnosis that her alle-\ngations are, therefore, false. In addition, it can be useful for the forensic\nmental health professional to understand these pathways in context with\nthe alleged perpetrator’s mental health status. Again, no diagnosis would\nmean that the perpetrator is guilty of the accusations; houever, mental\nhealth professionals can offer expertise in helping to understand the path-\nways to false allegations and false denials. Part of the focus of the present\npaper, then, is to bring atention to the dearth of psychological literature\ninvestigating correlates and causal mechanisms of false allegations of sexual\nassault and to propose a model specifying the major causal pathways to false\nallegations. These pathways are intended as a model for further empirical\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, a legitimate concern about enumerating such pathways is the\nmisuse of psychological diagnoses in determining the accuracy of specific\naccusations. It is important to recognize that a model that comprehensively\nand accurately identifies pathways provides information regarding necessary\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6272", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006278.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page lo of 29\nlo4 J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\nDenial of Consent\nA key issue in sexual assault is whether consent was given for the sexual\ncontact. Consent is complex and, in real-world situations, may have signifi-\ncant variability and may be rather subtle and, in general, an intricate process.\nRarely do sexual interactions begin with individuals explicitly stating “I give\nyou permission to do x, y, and z” (Hall, l998). Consent in sexual situa-\ntions is often implied, sometimes by the absence of a negative (‘She didn’t\nsay no or move away”) or inferred (‘She seems to be enjoying this” or\n“We did this in the past so I assumed she was ok with it”). Hickman and\nMuehlenhard (l999) found that nonverbal tactics were used more often than\nverbal consent. Consent is thought to involve both knouledge of what is\nbeing consented to and a belief that the person is free to either assent\nor not. Thus, a claim of lack of consent can also come from the person’s\n“feeling trapped” or “coerced,” which, again, the two parties may interpret\ndifferently. Houever, mistakes can be made in these situations and given\nthe motivations of the parties, these mistakes can be motivated (“I want this,\nso I interpret her silence as consent” or “She was free to leave at anytime;\nI was on top of her because I thought she wanted that”).\n\nUnderstanding whether consent was given is made more complex by\nthe fact that consent early in the interaction for a certain kind of sexual\ncontact is not consent for any and all further sexual contact in that episode.\nIn addition, consent for the same act (consent last week) is not consent for all\nfuture contact. This complexity led to the infamous Antioch College consent\npolicy that stated that there were multiple levels of sexual intimacy and\nevery time someone wants to proceed to another level, they must explicitly\nask and receive explicit verbal permission to proceed to this level (Francis,\nl996):\n\nIf the level of sexual intimacy increases during an interaction (.e., if two\n\npeople move from kissing while fully clothed—which is one level—to\n\nundressing for direct physical contact, which is another level), the people\ninvolved need to express their clear verbal consent before moving to that\n\nnew level. If one person wants to initiate moving to a higher level of\n\nsexual intimacy in an interaction, that person is responsible for geting the\n\nverbal consent of the otber person(s) involved before moving to that level.\n\n(p. l37)\n\nThis policy was critiqued on the grounds of its impracticality, but it\nraises the question hou explicit and hou often does consent need to be\nconveyed? This ambiguity creates a pathway for a false allegation in which\nthe alleged victim engaged in behaviors that can plausibly be <span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span>\nas providing consent, but the victim herself may not understand or realize\nthis. Thus, a false allegation can arise when it was reasonable to believe\nconsent was given but the alleged victim falsely believes that it was not.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6278", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006304.jpg": "ase l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-4 Filed ll/o8/2l Page /7 of:\nDietz 33\nCioffi (l976) <span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span> Freud as using the concept of seduction to refer\nonly to nonviolent sexual assaults, writing “. . . he duly reported that he had\ndiscovered the specific cause of psychoneurotic disorder: A passive sexual expe-\nrience before puberty.

Because neither he nor a friend or family member had been robbed or mugged\nor been the victim of a similar type of crime, he testified, he answered “No” to Question 25.\n\nThat interpretation of what it means to be a victim of a crime, while technically incorrect, does\nnot evince intentional deception or partiality.

United States, 43l U.S.\n65l (l977); an order denying a motion to dismiss under\nthe Speech or Debate Clause, see Helstoski v. Meanor,\n442 U.S. 5oo (l979); and an order permiting the\nforced administration of antipsychotic drugs to render\na defendant competent for trial, see Sell v. United\nStates, 539 U.S. l66 (2oo3). In contrast, the circum-\nstances in which the Supreme Court has “refused to\npermit interlocutory appeals’ in criminal cases have\nbeen “far more numerous.” Midland Asphalt, 489 U.S.\nat 799.\n\nAs to the third Van Cauwenberghe criterion, “[a]n\norder is effectively unreviewable where the order at is-\nsue involves an asserted right the legal and practical\nvalue of which would be destroyed if it were not vindi-\ncated before trial.” United States v.

The Treaty between the USA and France gives the French\ngovernment discretion as to whether or not to extradite its oun citizens to the USA.\nIt is noted that the leter of the French Minister does not provide any answer on this issue.\n2 The DOJ Memorandum and the Peterson Case\nIn support of its argument that the French government would not extradite Ms Ghislaine\nMaxwell to the USA, the government relies on the case of Mr Hans Peterson, a dual French\nAmerican citizen whose extradition to the US was denied by France in 2oo7.\nThe Peterson precedent should only be cited with great caution. First, | am not aware that this\ncase has given rise to a published judicial decision, therefore it should not be <span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span> as the\nsupport of any legal rule or principle. In addition, in regards to the documents that the DOJ has\nreferred to in its memorandum, | doubt that a judicial decision has ever occurred in this case:\nas mentioned by the 2oo7 leter of US Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama to the\nFrench Minister of Foreign Affairs, the French Minister of Justice communicated its decision\nrefusing extradition on August 22\" 2oo7, only a few days after the suspect was arrested (at the\nbeginning of August 2oo7). This decision is not a Court decision but a discretionary decision\nfrom the French Ministry of Justice. It actually seems very unlikely that a court decision could\nhave been rendered in this timeframe. This indicates that the case must not have been handed\non to the court by the Ministry of Justice in the earliest stage of the extradition process.\nA refusal to extradite may possibly be challenged by the requesting government before the\nFrench Conseil d’Etat, which is the French Supreme Court for administrative maters, as for\nexample the United Kingdom and Hong Kong successfully challenged a decision from the\nFrench authorities not to extradite an individual whose extradition they had requested (Conseil\nd’Etat, l5 Octoberl993, no. l42578).

If the\nperson is no longer a French national at the time of the request, the provision does not\napply.\n\nl2. Had these provisions been intended to apply in cases where the person has lost French\nnationality subsequent to the commission of the alleged crime, the texts would have\nexpressly stated so or would at least have used both the present and the past tense to\nqualify the national affiliation of the requested person.\n\nl3. Furthermore, it is a well-knoun principle of legal interpretation across all jurisdictions\nthat exceptions to rules must be construed strictly. The nationality ban being an\nexception to extradition, it must be <span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span> in a restrictive manner and its application\nto a person who is no longer a French national must be rejected.\n\nl4. Second, the Ministry’s interpretation goes against the spirit of the law\n\nl5. The literal reading of Article 3 of the Treaty and Article 696-4 of the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure is further supported by the fact that these provisions were in fact\nnot intended to apply in cases where the person sought has lost French citizenship, but\nonly in cases where that person has acquired French citizenship subsequent to the\ncommission of the alleged crime.\n\nl6. In other words, the rule that “nationality shall be assessed at the time of the offence for\nwhich extradition is requested” seeks to deny the extension of the benefit of French\nnationality to persons who have acquired French nationality after commiting an\noffence, in order to avoid fraudulent nationality applications of offenders seeking to\nescape extradition.\n\n3\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

Indeed, the Government’s and District Court’s capacious reading of\n§3283 would have wide-ranging ramifications in this Circuit—beyond Maxwell’s\ncase—if blessed by this Court.\n\nSection 3283 provides that “[n]o statute of limitations that would otherwise\npreclude prosecution for an offense involving the sexual or physical abuse, or\nkidnaping, of a child under the age of l8 years shall preclude such prosecution\nduring the life of the child, or for ten years after the offense, whichever is longer.”\n\nAl\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2llo3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021111.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page64 of ll3\ncorroborates Defendant’s interpretation.

This legislative history\nmakes no mention of crimes, such as Mann Act violations, that do not categorically\ninvolve the actual abuse of minors.\n\nRather than grounding its construction of § 3283 in the text or legislative\nhistory of the statute, the District Court relied almost exclusively on an inapposite\ndecision from this Court, Weingarten v. U.S., 865 F.3d 48 (2d Cir. 2ol7). The\nDistrict Court conceded, as it had to, that Weingarten is not controlling (Al47), but\nit essentially and erroneously treated Weingarten as though it were. The only\nquestion in Weingarten was whether the petitioner’s trial counsel provided\nconstitutionally deficient representation by conceding that an indictment charging\nMann Act violations was timely. See 865 F.3d at 52. The petitioner contended\nthat his trial counsel should have argued that § 3283 must be <span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span> under a\ncategorical standard. See id. at 58. This Court disagreed only because “/i/t was\nnot obvious at the time of Weingarten’s motion to dismiss, nor is it today, that a\ncourt must apply a categorical approach, rather than a fact-specific analysis, to\ndetermine whether an offense is subject to § 3282 or § 3283.” Id. at 58-59\n\n49\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021114.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page67 of ll3\n\nthe sexual abuse of a child.

As OPR has set forth\nin substantial detail in this Report, OPR did not find evidence to support allegations that the\nprosecutors sought to benefit Epstein at the expense of the victims. Instead, the result can more\nappropriately be tied to Acosta’s misplaced concerns about interfering with a traditionally state\ncrime and intruding on state authority. Acosta was also unwilling to abandon the path that he had\nset, even when Villafafia and Lourie advocated to end the negotiations and even though Acosta\nhimself had learned that the state authorities may not have been a reliable partner.\n\nMany of the problems that developed might have been avoided had Acosta engaged in\ngreater consultation with his staff before making key decisions. The contemporaneous records\nrevealed problems with communication and coordination among the five key participants. Acosta\nwas involved to a greater extent and made more decisions than he did in a typical case. Lourie\ntold OPR that it was “unusual to have a U.S. Atorney get involved with this level of detail.”\nMenchel told OPR, “I knou we would have spoken about this case a lot, okay? And I’m sure with\nJeff as well, and there were conversations -- a meeting that I had with Marie and Andy as well.”\nLourie similarly told OPR:\n\nWell, .. . he would have been talking to Jeff and Mat, talking to me\nto the extent that he did, he would have been looking at the Pros\nMemo and... the guidance from CEOS, he would have been\nreading the defense atorney’s leters, maybe talking to the State\nAtorney, I don’t knou, just... all these different sources of\ninformation he was -- I’m comfortable that he knew the case, you\nknou, that he was, he was reading everything. Apparently, he, you\nknou, read the Pros Memo, he read all the stuff....\n\nAt the same time, Acosta was significantly removed, both in physical distance and in levels\nin the supervisory chain, from the individuals with the most knouledge of the facts of the case—\nVillafafia and, to a lesser extent, Lourie. Lourie normally would have signed off on the prosecution\nmemorandum on his oun, but as he told OPR, he recognized that the case was going to go through\nthe front office “[b]ecause there was front office involvement from the get go.” Yet, although\nAcosta became involved at certain points in order to make decisions, he did not view himself as\noverseeing the investigation or the details of implementing his decisions. OPR observed that as a\nconsequence, management of the case suffered from both an absence of ounership of the\ninvestigation and failures in communication that affected critical decisions.\n\nOn occasion, Villafafia included Acosta directly in emails, but often, information upon\nwhich Acosta relied for his decisions and information about the decisions Acosta had made\ntraveled through multiple layers between Acosta and Villafafia. Villafafia did draft a detailed,\nanalytical prosecution memorandum, but it is not clear that Acosta read it and instead may have\nrelied on conversations primarily with Menchel and later with Sloman after Menchel’s departure.\nDespite these discussions, though, it is not clear that Acosta was aware of certain information, such\nas Oosterban’s strong opinion from the outset in favor of the prosecution or of Villafafia’s\nconcerns and objections to a state-based resolution or the final NPA. Acosta <span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span> the state\nindictment on only one charge as a sign that the case was weak evidentially, but it is not clear that\nwhen making his decision to resolve the mater though a state-based plea, he knew the extent to\n\nl83\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l383", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021384.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lo. 3536o38, Page2l2 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2lo of 348\nwhich Villafafia and Lourie believed that the state had intentionally failed to aggressively pursue\na broader state indictment.\n\nOne example illustrates this communication gap. In a September 2o, 2oo7 email to Lourie\nasking him to read the latest version of the proposed “hybrid” federal plea agreement (calling for\nEpstein to plead to both state and federal charges), Acosta noted, “I don’t typically sign plea\nagreements. We should only go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement. I\ndidn’t even sign the public corruption or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not be the first.”\n(Emphasis added.) In his email to Villafafia, Lourie atached Acosta’s email and instructed\nVillafafia to “change the signature block to your name and send as final to Jay [Lefkouitz].”\n(Emphasis added.) Villafafia raised no objection to signing the agreement. Acosta told OPR that\nhe wanted to give the “trial team” a chance to “speak up and let him knou” if they did not feel\ncomfortable with the agreement. Villafafia, houever, told OPR that she did not understand that\nshe was being given an opportunity to object to the agreement; rather, she believed Acosta wanted.\nher to sign it because he was taking an “‘arm’s length” approach and signaling this “was not his\ndeal.” The fact that the top decision maker believed he was giving the line AUSA an opportunity\nto reflect and stop the process if she believed the deal was inappropriate, but the line AUSA\nbelieved she was being ordered to sign the agreement because her boss wanted to distance himself\nfrom the decision, reflects a serious communication gap.\n\nAs another example, at one point, Villafafia, frustrated and concerned about the decisions\nbeing made concerning a possible resolution, requested a meeting with Acosta; in a sternly worded\nrebuke, Menchel rejected the request. Although Menchel told OPR that he was not prohibiting\nVillafafia from speaking to Acosta, Villafafia <span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span> Menchel’s email to mean that she could\nnot seek a meeting with Acosta. As a consequence, Acosta made his decision about a state\nresolution and the term of incarceration without any direct input from Villafafia. Acosta told OPR\nthat he was unaware that Villafafia had sought a meeting with him and he would have met with\nher if she had asked him directly. OPR did not find any writen evidence of a meeting involving\nboth Acosta—the final decision maker—and Villafafia—the person most knouledgeable about the\nfacts and the law—before Acosta made his decision to resolve the case through state charges or to\noffer the two-year term, and Villafafia said she did not have any input into the decision. Although\na U.S. Atorney is certainly not required to have such direct input, and it may be that Menchel\npresented what he believed to be Villafafia’s views, OPR found no evidence that Acosta was aware\nof Villafafia’s strong views about, and objections to, the proposed resolution.”°°\n\nTwo logistical problems hindered effective communication. First, the senior managers\ninvolved in the case—Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel—had offices located in Miami, while the\noffices of the individuals most familiar with facts of the case—Villafafia and, to a lesser extent,\nLourie—were located in West Palm Beach. Consequently, Villafafia’s discussions with her senior\n#9o In her 2ol7 Declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that, given the challenges of obtaining\nvictims’ cooperation with a federal prosecution, “I believed and still believe that a negotiated resolution of the mater\nwas in the best interests of the [USAO] and the victims as a whole. The [USAO] had also reached that same\nconclusion.” Several subjects pointed to this statement as indicating that Villafafia in fact supported the NPA. In her\nOPR interview, houever, Villafafia drew a distinction between resolving the investigation through negotiations that\nled to what in her view was a reasonable outcome, which she would have supported, and “this negotiated resolution” —\nthat is, the NPA—which she did not support.\n\nl84\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l384", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021386.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lD 3536o38, Page2l4 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l2 of 348\nparties.*°> The rush to reach a resolution should not have led the USAO to agree to such a\nsignificant provision without a full consideration of the potential consequences and justification\nfor the provision. It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused.\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\n<span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span> the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation.

This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n#o8 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s\n\nunderstood that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you\n\nknou the husband’s willing to go and take the weight .... This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l386", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021458.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 389 3536o39, Page28 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 282 of 348\n\nAs discussed belou, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\nunambiguous duty under the CVRA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without\na federal criminal charge. In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”*?°\n\nA, At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department <span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span> the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—is “always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’””*°’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\n396 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nao Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l458", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021752.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 87, o7/27/2o23, 35482o2, Pagelo of 35\n\nSee U.S. v.

Although Papa held that the plea agreement did not bind\n\nother districts because the evidence revealed an intent to bind only one\n\ndistrict, the Second Circuit apparently has broadly <span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span> this case\n\nas meaning that plea agreements do not bind other districts absent an\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2l838", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021841.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ll7, ll/ol/2o24, 3636586, Pagel7 of 5l\nappropriate circumstances, be invoked to estop the United States...”); US. v.\nHarvey, 79l F.2d 294, 3o3 (4th Cir. l986) (“Whenever a United States Atorney\nnegotiates and enters a plea agreement, it is the Government that ‘agrees’ to whatever\nis agreed to.”); U.S. v. Carter, 454 F.2d 426 (4th Cir. l972) (en banc) (vacating\nconviction where a plea “bargain was allegedly breached in a neighboring district,”\nadding that “[t]he United States government is the United States government\nthroughout all of the states and districts”); Young v. U.S., 953 F.Supp.2d lo49, lo69\nn.4 (D.S.D. 2ol3) (plea agreement between defendant and “the United States” in\nWest Virginia would bind federal prosecutors in South Dakota); Litle v. U.S., Nos.\nl:o8-cr-59, l:o9-cv-822, 2olo WL 3942749, at *3 (S.D.

It is well-setled that\n“we determine whether a plea agreement has been breached by looking to the\nreasonable understanding of the parties and by resolving any ambiguities against the\nGovernment.” Jn re Altro, l8o F.3d 372, 375 (2d Cir. l999); see also U.S. v.\nCarmichael, 2l6 F.3d 224 (2d Cir. 2ooo) (“[W]e ‘construe plea agreements strictly\nagainst the Government.”’’) (quoting U.S. v. Ready, 82 F.3d 55l, 559 (2d Cir. l996)).\nBut Annabi flips this formulation on its head, holding that an ambiguous promise of\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l84l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022036.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Page l3 of 38\nin uncovering admissible evidence, aiding witness preparation, corroborating testimony, or\nassisting impeachment or rebutal.” United States v.

Stein, 488 F. Supp. 2d 35o, 356 (S.D.N. ¥.2oo7) (quoting United\nStates v. Lloyd, 992 F.2d 348, 35l (D.C.Cir.l993)). Lloyd, 992 F.2d at 35l (internal citation and\nquotation marks omited); United States v. George, 786 F. Supp. ll, l3 (D.D.C. l99l) (the\nmateriality hurdle “is not a high one”). The requested documents in this motion are essential to\nMr. Thomas’ ability to prepare a defense. Mr. Thomas contends that the conduct with which he\nis being charged is: l) rampant throughout the BOP; 2) made with knouledge and acquiescence\nby the leadership of the BOP; and 3) is the direct result of BOP policies and mismanagement that\nforced the defendant to engage in conduct for which he is nou being charged criminally.\nMoreover, the information sought in this motion is crucial to the preparation of Mr. Thomas’\ndefense. For instance, Mr. Thomas will assert that the rampant staffing shortages present at the\nMCC in August of 2ol9 led to the conduct for which Mr. Thomas is nou criminally charged. If\nthe Court accepts this representation, then the Court should find that the discovery requests\n| contained in this motion are “material” and must be disclosed. As support for this position the\ndefendant has atached an excerpt from a union commitee meeting that was held merely 3 days\nbefore Jeffrey Epstein died at MCC on August lo, 2ol9.

As OPR has set forth\nin substantial detail in this Report, OPR did not find evidence to support allegations that the\nprosecutors sought to benefit Epstein at the expense of the victims. Instead, the result can more\nappropriately be tied to Acosta’s misplaced concerns about interfering with a traditionally state\ncrime and intruding on state authority. Acosta was also unwilling to abandon the path that he had\nset, even when Villafafia and Lourie advocated to end the negotiations and even though Acosta\nhimself had learned that the state authorities may not have been a reliable partner.\n\nMany of the problems that developed might have been avoided had Acosta engaged in\ngreater consultation with his staff before making key decisions. The contemporaneous records\nrevealed problems with communication and coordination among the five key participants. Acosta\nwas involved to a greater extent and made more decisions than he did in a typical case. Lourie\ntold OPR that it was “unusual to have a U.S. Atorney get involved with this level of detail.”\nMenchel told OPR, “I knou we would have spoken about this case a lot, okay? And I’m sure with\nJeff as well, and there were conversations -- a meeting that I had with Marie and Andy as well.”\nLourie similarly told OPR:\n\nWell, ... he would have been talking to Jeff and Mat, talking to me\nto the extent that he did, he would have been looking at the Pros\nMemo and... the guidance from CEOS, he would have been\nreading the defense atorney’s leters, maybe talking to the State\nAtorney, I don’t knou, just . . . all these different sources of\ninformation he was -- I’m comfortable that he knew the case, you\nknou, that he was, he was reading everything. Apparently, he, you\nknou, read the Pros Memo, he read all the stuff. ...\n\nAt the same time, Acosta was significantly removed, both in physical distance and in levels\nin the supervisory chain, from the individuals with the most knouledge of the facts of the case—\nVillafafia and, to a lesser extent, Lourie. Lourie normally would have signed off on the prosecution\nmemorandum on his oun, but as he told OPR, he recognized that the case was going to go through\nthe front office “[b]ecause there was front office involvement from the get go.” Yet, although\nAcosta became involved at certain points in order to make decisions, he did not view himself as\noverseeing the investigation or the details of implementing his decisions. OPR observed that as a\nconsequence, management of the case suffered from both an absence of ounership of the\ninvestigation and failures in communication that affected critical decisions.\n\nOn occasion, Villafafia included Acosta directly in emails, but often, information upon\nwhich Acosta relied for his decisions and information about the decisions Acosta had made\ntraveled through multiple layers between Acosta and Villafafia. Villafafia did draft a detailed,\nanalytical prosecution memorandum, but it is not clear that Acosta read it and instead may have\nrelied on conversations primarily with Menchel and later with Sloman after Menchel’s departure.\nDespite these discussions, though, it is not clear that Acosta was aware of certain information, such\nas Oosterban’s strong opinion from the outset in favor of the prosecution or of Villafafia’s\nconcerns and objections to a state-based resolution or the final NPA. Acosta <span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span> the state\nindictment on only one charge as a sign that the case was weak evidentially, but it is not clear that\nwhen making his decision to resolve the mater though a state-based plea, he knew the extent to\n\nl83\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2322l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023222.jpg": "which Villafafia and Lourie believed that the state had intentionally failed to aggressively pursue\na broader state indictment.\n\nOne example illustrates this communication gap. In a September 2o, 2oo7 email to Lourie\nasking him to read the latest version of the proposed “hybrid” federal plea agreement (calling for\nEpstein to plead to both state and federal charges), Acosta noted, “I don’t typically sign plea\nagreements. We should only go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement. I\ndidn’t even sign the public corruption or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not be the first.”\n(Emphasis added.) In his email to Villafafia, Lourie atached Acosta’s email and instructed\nVillafafia to “change the signature block to your name and send as final to Jay [Lefkouitz].”\n(Emphasis added.) Villafafia raised no objection to signing the agreement. Acosta told OPR that\nhe wanted to give the “trial team” a chance to “speak up and let him knou” if they did not feel\ncomfortable with the agreement. Villafafia, houever, told OPR that she did not understand that\nshe was being given an opportunity to object to the agreement; rather, she believed Acosta wanted\nher to sign it because he was taking an “‘arm’s length” approach and signaling this “was not his\ndeal.” The fact that the top decision maker believed he was giving the line AUSA an opportunity\nto reflect and stop the process if she believed the deal was inappropriate, but the line AUSA\nbelieved she was being ordered to sign the agreement because her boss wanted to distance himself\nfrom the decision, reflects a serious communication gap.\n\nAs another example, at one point, Villafafia, frustrated and concerned about the decisions\nbeing made concerning a possible resolution, requested a meeting with Acosta; in a sternly worded\nrebuke, Menchel rejected the request. Although Menchel told OPR that he was not prohibiting\nVillafafia from speaking to Acosta, Villafafia <span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span> Menchel’s email to mean that she could\nnot seek a meeting with Acosta. As a consequence, Acosta made his decision about a state\nresolution and the term of incarceration without any direct input from Villafafia. Acosta told OPR\nthat he was unaware that Villafafia had sought a meeting with him and he would have met with\nher if she had asked him directly. OPR did not find any writen evidence of a meeting involving\nboth Acosta—the final decision maker—and Villafafia—the person most knouledgeable about the\nfacts and the law—before Acosta made his decision to resolve the case through state charges or to\noffer the two-year term, and Villafafia said she did not have any input into the decision. Although\na U.S. Atorney is certainly not required to have such direct input, and it may be that Menchel\npresented what he believed to be Villafafia’s views, OPR found no evidence that Acosta was aware\nof Villafafia’s strong views about, and objections to, the proposed resolution.”*°\n\nTwo logistical problems hindered effective communication. First, the senior managers\ninvolved in the case—Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel—had offices located in Miami, while the\noffices of the individuals most familiar with facts of the case—Villafafia and, to a lesser extent,\nLourie—were located in West Palm Beach. Consequently, Villafafia’s discussions with her senior\n256 In her 2ol7 Declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that, given the challenges of obtaining\nvictims’ cooperation with a federal prosecution, “I believed and still believe that a negotiated resolution of the mater\nwas in the best interests of the [USAO] and the victims as a whole. The [USAO] had also reached that same\nconclusion.” Several subjects pointed to this statement as indicating that Villafafia in fact supported the NPA. In her\nOPR interview, houever, Villafafia drew a distinction between resolving the investigation through negotiations that\nled to what in her view was a reasonable outcome, which she would have supported, and “this negotiated resolution” —\nthat is, the NPA—which she did not support.\n\nl84\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23222", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023224.jpg": "parties.7°* The rush to reach a resolution should not have led the USAO to agree to such a\nsignificant provision without a full consideration of the potential consequences and justification\nfor the provision. It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\n<span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span> the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n258 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort. . ..\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s\n\nunderstood that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you\n\nknou the husband’s willing to go and take the weight .... This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23224", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023294.jpg": "As discussed belou, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\nunambiguous duty under the CVRA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without\na federal criminal charge. In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”*”°\n\nA, At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department <span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span> the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—ls “‘always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.””*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\nl28 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\ned Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23294", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000035.tif": "QUESTION PRESENTED\n\nThis Court long has recognized that “when a plea\nrests in any significant degree on a promise or\nagreement of the prosecutor, so that it can be said to\nbe part of the inducement or consideration, such\npromise must be fulfilled.” Santobello v.

This turns a blind eye\nto the problem. The very premise of Petitioner’s\nargument is that the parties to the NPA did seek to\ncontrol the scope of the relevant clauses by narrouing\nthe scope of immunity for Epstein through the use of\nnarrou language specifying enforceability only in the\nSouthern District of Florida, and then expanding the\nscope of it as to his co-conspirators by using the broad\nterm “the United States.” (App. 3o-3l). While doing so,\nEpstein’s lawyers were no doubt informed by hou that\nlanguage was <span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span> in the jurisdiction in which\nthey were practicing.\n\nYet by definition, the issue presented in this case\nand every other like it only arises when the language\nin question is being <span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span> in a different\njurisdiction than the one where the agreement was\nnegotiated. Accordingly, uniformity in interpretation\nof such a provision is unusually and particularly\ncompelling.

As OPR has set forth\nin substantial detail in this Report, OPR did not find evidence to support allegations that the\nprosecutors sought to benefit Epstein at the expense of the victims. Instead, the result can more\nappropriately be tied to Acosta’s misplaced concerns about interfering with a traditionally state\ncrime and intruding on state authority. Acosta was also unwilling to abandon the path that he had\nset, even when Villafafia and Lourie advocated to end the negotiations and even though Acosta\nhimself had learned that the state authorities may not have been a reliable partner.\n\nMany of the problems that developed might have been avoided had Acosta engaged in\ngreater consultation with his staff before making key decisions. The contemporaneous records\nrevealed problems with communication and coordination among the five key participants. Acosta\nwas involved to a greater extent and made more decisions than he did in a typical case. Lourie\ntold OPR that it was “unusual to have a U.S. Atorney get involved with this level of detail.”\nMenchel told OPR, “I knou we would have spoken about this case a lot, okay? And I’m sure with\nJeff as well, and there were conversations -- a meeting that I had with Marie and Andy as well.”\nLourie similarly told OPR:\n\nWell, ... he would have been talking to Jeff and Mat, talking to me\nto the extent that he did, he would have been looking at the Pros\nMemo and... the guidance from CEOS, he would have been\nreading the defense atorney’s leters, maybe talking to the State\nAtorney, I don’t knou, just . . . all these different sources of\ninformation he was -- I’m comfortable that he knew the case, you\nknou, that he was, he was reading everything. Apparently, he, you\nknou, read the Pros Memo, he read all the stuff. ...\n\nAt the same time, Acosta was significantly removed, both in physical distance and in levels\nin the supervisory chain, from the individuals with the most knouledge of the facts of the case—\nVillafafia and, to a lesser extent, Lourie. Lourie normally would have signed off on the prosecution\nmemorandum on his oun, but as he told OPR, he recognized that the case was going to go through\nthe front office “[b]ecause there was front office involvement from the get go.” Yet, although\nAcosta became involved at certain points in order to make decisions, he did not view himself as\noverseeing the investigation or the details of implementing his decisions. OPR observed that as a\nconsequence, management of the case suffered from both an absence of ounership of the\ninvestigation and failures in communication that affected critical decisions.\n\nOn occasion, Villafafia included Acosta directly in emails, but often, information upon\nwhich Acosta relied for his decisions and information about the decisions Acosta had made\ntraveled through multiple layers between Acosta and Villafafia. Villafafia did draft a detailed,\nanalytical prosecution memorandum, but it is not clear that Acosta read it and instead may have\nrelied on conversations primarily with Menchel and later with Sloman after Menchel’s departure.\nDespite these discussions, though, it is not clear that Acosta was aware of certain information, such\nas Oosterban’s strong opinion from the outset in favor of the prosecution or of Villafafia’s\nconcerns and objections to a state-based resolution or the final NPA. Acosta <span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span> the state\nindictment on only one charge as a sign that the case was weak evidentially, but it is not clear that\nwhen making his decision to resolve the mater though a state-based plea, he knew the extent to\n\nl83\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2322l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023222.tif": "which Villafafia and Lourie believed that the state had intentionally failed to aggressively pursue\na broader state indictment.\n\nOne example illustrates this communication gap. In a September 2o, 2oo7 email to Lourie\nasking him to read the latest version of the proposed “hybrid” federal plea agreement (calling for\nEpstein to plead to both state and federal charges), Acosta noted, “I don’t typically sign plea\nagreements. We should only go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement. I\ndidn’t even sign the public corruption or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not be the first.”\n(Emphasis added.) In his email to Villafafia, Lourie atached Acosta’s email and instructed\nVillafafia to “change the signature block to your name and send as final to Jay [Lefkouitz].”\n(Emphasis added.) Villafafia raised no objection to signing the agreement. Acosta told OPR that\nhe wanted to give the “trial team” a chance to “speak up and let him knou” if they did not feel\ncomfortable with the agreement. Villafafia, houever, told OPR that she did not understand that\nshe was being given an opportunity to object to the agreement; rather, she believed Acosta wanted\nher to sign it because he was taking an “‘arm’s length” approach and signaling this “was not his\ndeal.” The fact that the top decision maker believed he was giving the line AUSA an opportunity\nto reflect and stop the process if she believed the deal was inappropriate, but the line AUSA\nbelieved she was being ordered to sign the agreement because her boss wanted to distance himself\nfrom the decision, reflects a serious communication gap.\n\nAs another example, at one point, Villafafia, frustrated and concerned about the decisions\nbeing made concerning a possible resolution, requested a meeting with Acosta; in a sternly worded\nrebuke, Menchel rejected the request. Although Menchel told OPR that he was not prohibiting\nVillafafia from speaking to Acosta, Villafafia <span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span> Menchel’s email to mean that she could\nnot seek a meeting with Acosta. As a consequence, Acosta made his decision about a state\nresolution and the term of incarceration without any direct input from Villafafia. Acosta told OPR\nthat he was unaware that Villafafia had sought a meeting with him and he would have met with\nher if she had asked him directly. OPR did not find any writen evidence of a meeting involving\nboth Acosta—the final decision maker—and Villafafia—the person most knouledgeable about the\nfacts and the law—before Acosta made his decision to resolve the case through state charges or to\noffer the two-year term, and Villafafia said she did not have any input into the decision. Although\na U.S. Atorney is certainly not required to have such direct input, and it may be that Menchel\npresented what he believed to be Villafafia’s views, OPR found no evidence that Acosta was aware\nof Villafafia’s strong views about, and objections to, the proposed resolution.”*°\n\nTwo logistical problems hindered effective communication. First, the senior managers\ninvolved in the case—Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel—had offices located in Miami, while the\noffices of the individuals most familiar with facts of the case—Villafafia and, to a lesser extent,\nLourie—were located in West Palm Beach. Consequently, Villafafia’s discussions with her senior\n256 In her 2ol7 Declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that, given the challenges of obtaining\nvictims’ cooperation with a federal prosecution, “I believed and still believe that a negotiated resolution of the mater\nwas in the best interests of the [USAO] and the victims as a whole. The [USAO] had also reached that same\nconclusion.” Several subjects pointed to this statement as indicating that Villafafia in fact supported the NPA. In her\nOPR interview, houever, Villafafia drew a distinction between resolving the investigation through negotiations that\nled to what in her view was a reasonable outcome, which she would have supported, and “this negotiated resolution”—\nthat is, the NPA—which she did not support.\n\nl84\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23222", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023224.tif": "parties.7°* The rush to reach a resolution should not have led the USAO to agree to such a\nsignificant provision without a full consideration of the potential consequences and justification\nfor the provision. It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\n<span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span> the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n258 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s\n\nunderstood that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you\n\nknou the husband’s willing to go and take the weight .... This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23224", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023294.tif": "As discussed belou, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\nunambiguous duty under the CVRA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without\na federal criminal charge. In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”?”°\n\nA. At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department <span class=\"highlight\">interpreted</span> the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—ls “‘always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.””*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\n396 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\n\n397 Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n256\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23294"};
