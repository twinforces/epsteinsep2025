Department of Justice\nGee) Federal Bureau of Prisons\nJF Central Office\nOffice of the Director Washington, DC 2o334\nJune 22, 2o23\n\nMEMORANDUM FOR SARAH E. LAKE\n\nASSISTANT INSPECTOR GENERAL\n\nINVESTIGATIONS DIVISION\n\nyon <a>\n”\n\nFROM: Colete 8. Peters, Director\nSUBJECT: Response to the Office of Inspector General’s (OIG) Draft Report:\n\nInvestigation and Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Custody, Care,\n\nand Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional Center\n\nin New York, New York\nThe Bureau of Prisons (BOP) appreciates the opportunity to formally respond to the Office of the\nInspector General's (OIG) above-referenced draft report. BOP values OIG's careful review of the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein and concurs with the\nrecommendations resulting from this engagement. The lessons learned during the course of this\nengagement will be applied to the broader BOP correctional landscape.\nThe facts and circumstances related to those few BOP employees at MCC New York in this\nreport reflect a failure to follou BOP’s longstanding policies, regulations, and/or laws. While\nthis misconduct described in this report is troubling, those who took part in it represent a very\nsmall percentage of the approximately 35,ooo employees across more than l2o institutions who\ncontinue to strive for correctional <span class=\"highlight\">excellence</span> every day.\nIn the Report, OIG makes recommendations to enhance BOP policies and practices and improve\naccountability. In response to this and previous OIG and Government Accountability Office\n(GAO) engagements, BOP has already begun to evaluate nationwide trends and strengthen\nemployee accountability.\n\nll5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23482\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023483.jpg": "OIG Official Draft Report: BOP’s Care, Custody, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at MCC New York,\nNew York\nJune 22, 2o23\nPage 2 of 3\nIn April of this year, BOP’s leadership announced ts new mission as \"corrections professionals\nwho foster a humane and secure environment and ensure public safety by preparing individuals\nfor successful reentry into our communities.\" BOP’s new core values include accountability,\nintegrity, respect, compassion, and correctional <span class=\"highlight\">excellence</span>. Of note, our core value of\naccountability requires BOP employees to be responsible and transparent to the public,\nourselves, and to those in our care and custody by the standards we establish, the actions we take,\nand the duties we perform. As reflected in our mission and core values, BOP is commited to\nproviding a safe environment for both employees and adults in our custody.\nRecommendation One: The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate\nfollouing suicide watch or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the\nparticular individual or security considerations.\nBOP’s Response: The BOP recognizes the importance of careful monitoring of adults in\ncustody who face mental health challenges and therefore concurs with this recommendation.\nOur practice is to carefully consider both the well-being and safety of the individual involved\nand overarching safety and security concerns. In the years since Mr. Epstein’s death, the BOP\nhas updated its process related to suicide watch and psychological observation. Under BOP’s\nrevised process, upon removal from suicide watch or psychological observation, psychologists\nmake individualized care recommendations about clinical follou-up and other custodial\nconcerns, including housing and cellmates. Mental health, custody, and unit team employees\nwork collaboratively to ensure that each individual removed from suicide watch is housed\nappropriately.\nRecommendation Two: The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for\nsuicide and for whom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the\nrecommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan for cellmate\nre-assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or security\nconsiderations.\nBOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation. As described in its response to\nRecommendation l, BOP’s current process related to suicide watch and psychological\nobservation applies an individualized approach to the care and custody of adults in custody.\nUpon removal from suicide watch or psychological observation, individualized care\nrecommendations are made by psychologists, custody, and unit team for each individual. BOP\nthoroughly evaluates each celling assignment on an individual basis for persons deemed to be at\nmoderate to high risk for suicide.\nRecommendation Three: The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and\ndocumenting approval for social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or\npsychological observation, which allous for institution-specific variations in the process, and\nprovide guidance on standard components that each institution should include in its process to\nmitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on suicide watch or psychological\nobservation.\n\nll6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23483\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023785.jpg": "Fwd: for Mr. Jeffrey Edward Epstein, Register Number: 763l8-o54\n\nFrom NYM/Exec Assistant~\n\nTo NYM/Executive Salt POP |\n\nDate 2ol9/o7/3l o6:33\n\nSubject: Fwd: for Mr. Jeffrey Edward Epstein, Register Number: 763 l8-o54\n\nAteaSh GAAS: TEXT.htm, IMAGE.png, IMAGE.png, Epstein_Leter_ VI. pdf,\n\nMime.822\n>> POPU) @mergan.edu> 7/3o/2ol9 4:ol PM >>>\nJuly 3o, 2ol9\n\nMr. Jeffrey Edward Epstein\nRegister Number: 763 l8-o54\nAge 66, White Male\nMCC New York\nMetropolitan Correctional Center\n\nEmail: NYM/ExecAssistant@bop.gov\n\nPhone: 646-836-63oo\n\nFax: 646-836-775l\nl5o Park Rou\nNew York City, NY looo7\nDear Mr. Epstein,\n\nYou called me circa August 2ol7 and you and I had\na Skype call with my Ph.D. student in December 2ol7.\n= a a\ncS go> --)\nry SCENTIST Or THe Year: Dr. & Allen Counter, (l) director of the Harvard\nFoundation of Harvard University, and Dr. Benedict AL Gree (rh, dean of Harrard\nCollege and Leveret.
