For l5 of those years, I\nserved in the United Kingdom Special Forces. I have worked in the security industry for ten\nyears and have gained a level 6 Security Risk Management Consultants (SRMC) qualification,\nworking touards a master’s degree in Risk Management. I hold numerous <span class=\"highlight\">instructional</span> and\noperational licenses qualifying me to deliver several types of security services under the UK\nSecurity Industry Authority, including a certification to provide close protection services for\nindividuals facing physical threats. I am a member of the Academy of Security Intelligence and\nRisk Studies and have ouned and operated security companies in all capacities in a number of\ndifferent countries.\n\n2. As part of my security portfolio, I have secured global assets and have protected numerous high\nvalue persons. As an example, I was contracted to guard the UKs third richest person,\naccording to Forbes, after he broke his agreed bail conditions with another consultant. Under\nmy protection never escaped again and completed his high-profile court appearances to\ncessation.\n\n3. Ihave provided security consultation and services for the Maxwell family for a number of years\nin both the United Kingdom and United States. I provided security services for Ghislaine\nMaxwell from approximately July 2ol9 through up to the time of her arrest on July 2, 2o2o.\n\n4. Ms. Maxwell faced a number of security issues. For example, I was aware that she received a\nnumber of death threats connected to her relationship with Jeffery Epstein some 2o years\npreviously. She was also the target of aggressive behavior by members of the press who were\ntrying to achieve a ‘scoop.’ This kind of behavior is not only harassing, but can be life\nthreatening. A good example is the case of Princess Diana, who unfortunately lost her life due to\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2o84\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007850.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 357 of 375\nLaPorte CV (Version 2o2o.3) Page 4 of l9\nProfessional and Scientific Commitees:\n\nl.
