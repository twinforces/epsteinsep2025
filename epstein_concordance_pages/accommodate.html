So I hope everybody can hear me.\n\n6 The purpose of today's proceeding, as I'm sure you're\n7 all aware, is to conduct a bail hearing. In this mater, as I\n8 think you knou, the government is seeking continued pretrial\n\n9 remand of Mr. Epstein and the defense is arguing for pretrial\nlo release. The parties have submited helpful writen\n\nll submissions, and they have been placed on the docket.\n\nl2 You should also be aware, if you weren't -- I don't\n\nl3 think you are -- that there is what's called a pretrial\n\nl4 services report. One has been filed with me today.\n\nl5 Typically the purpose of such a report is to make a\n\nl6 recommendation to the Court as to whether there should be bail\nl7 or detention.\n\nl8 There was an additional report -- I think they've\n\nl9 goten additional information in today's report -- and the\n2o representatives of pretrial services are here in the court\n2l today.\n22 The report itself is typically not filed on the\n23 docket, but it does conclude as follous. This is a quote. It\n24 says that \"There is no condition or combination of conditions\n25 that will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo5l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000609.jpg": "JCasenist9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 4o _ Filed o7/26/l9 Page 5of6 5\n\nl to Saudi Arabia as a residence.\n\n2 I think I have given you a fair account of the\n\n3 decision and order.

The state Supreme Court has even concluded\n\nl4 that the expansion and codification of victims' rights provides\nl5 the changed conditions needed for overruling the rule of\n\nl6 abatement. It has also been stated that Alaska's statute and\nl7 its constitution nou require the criminal justice system to\n\nl8 <span class=\"highlight\">accommodate</span> the rights of crime victims. Further, that the\n\nl9 abatement of criminal convictions has important implications\n2o for these rights.\n2l But coming back to our case, which is what you are\n22 concerned about and I am as well, it is appropriate to conclude\n23 that if the rule of abatement applies to a convicted defendant\n24 as in the Wright case, it should also apply a fortiori in the\n25 Epstein case, which was still in the pretrial phase when\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo647\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000846.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document l-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65965, Page/7 of 24\no7/o8/2o2o)\n\no7/o8/2o2o | l5 | MOTION for Jeffrey S.

First, the government represents that, per the United States Marshal’s Service, “the\ninterview room at the courthouse can be made available for [Mr. Robertson] to meet with his\natorneys to prepare for trial, for unlimited meetings and unlimited durations of meetings during\nbusiness hours, excepting only times when the Aspen courtroom is in use.” Doc. 298 at 2. There\nis a catch, houever: “There is a screen in the interview room, which will allou for appropriate\nsocial distancing between [Mr. Robertson] and his lawyers.” Jd. Second, the government\nrepresents that “the Santa Fe jail is willing to provide an exception to the policy barring in-person\natorney visits, and will work to <span class=\"highlight\">accommodate</span> in-person visits between Robertson and _ his\natorneys.” Id.\n\nWhile the Court appreciates the government’s effort in gathering information on these\nalternatives, they do not change its decision on release. First, the Court notes that the government\ncould have, and should have, presented this information earlier if it wanted the Court to rely on\nthese alternatives to deny release. Mr. Robertson filed his motion for reconsideration on December\n2l, 2o2o. Doc. 274. The government had a month and a half to investigate alternatives and make\nits argument against release. It cannot wait until an unfavorable ruling to present additional\nevidence that it was capable of presenting in the first instance. A motion for reconsideration is\nfor presenting new evidence that was “previously unavailable.” Servants of Paraclete, 2o4 F.3d\nat lol2.\n\nSecond, the proposed alternatives are inadequate to address the trial preparation concerns\nthe Court has articulated. The proposal to use the interview room at the Santa Fe courthouse is\ninadequate because the room, by the government’s oun description, will still contain a “screen”\nbetween Mr. Robertson and his atorneys. For all of the reasons set forth above, the defense team\ncannot effectively prepare for trial if they cannot sit next to Mr. Robertson and go over documents\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool3o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001305.jpg": "Casse :27-Cr-O29o48uMen(DbcanehO3O 2Filee O2Io6/Alagedge o5 F5l6\n\nline by line in a way that is not possible through a screen. The fact that the interview room will be\nunavailable when the Aspen courtroom is in use is also unacceptable because the courtroom has\nbeen, and will be, in frequent use, just as it was when the parties in this case met all day for the\nDaubert hearing and pretrial conference on February 4. The Court’s calendar is also constantly\nshifting, meaning that the defense team will have litle to no ability to confidently predict when\nthey will be able to meet with Mr. Robertson. The proposal involving the Santa Fe County\nDetention Center fares no beter. The government’s language is tellingly equivocal. First, it states\nthat “the Santa Fe jail is potentially willing to amend their policy that currently bars in-person\natorney visits in response to this Court’s concerns.” Doc. 298 at l (emphasis added). Later, the\ngovernment writes that the jail is willing to allou in-person meetings, but that it will “work to\n<span class=\"highlight\">accommodate</span> in-person visits between Robertson and his atorneys.” /d. at 2 (emphasis added).\nRather than inspire confidence, the language of government’s motion reflects the high level of\nuncertainty that our jails have operated with over the last year. The truth remains that the Santa\nFe County Detention Center, like all jails, can still go into a full and indefinite lockdoun at any\ntime due to the continued spread of COVID-l9 (and potentially the virus’s recent and more\ninfectious variants). The Court also does not want to put the jail or the defense team at risk of\nCOVID-l9 because the jail feels compelled to deviate from what it believes are its best safety\npractices. Neither of the government’s proposals are adequate to provide Mr. Robertson the\nconsistent and predictable in-person contact with his defense atorneys that he needs.\n\nFinally, the Court will not grant the requested stay pending appeal, as it noted in its earlier\nrelease order. Doc. 3oo. First, the government has failed to cite or apply the legal standard for\nsuch a stay. See D.N.M. Local R. Crim. P. 47.7 (“A motion, response or reply must cite authority\nin support of legal positions advanced.”).

See United States\nv. Johnson, 2l F. Supp. 2d 329, 334-35 (S.D.N.Y. l998); United States v. Kenny, 883 F. Supp.\n869, 874-75 (E.D.N.Y. l995). As such, neither case supports the proposition that where a\ndefendant is challenging the selection of the grand jury, the relevant “community” is the\npopulation of the location in which her trial will be held. Such a comparison is unjustified, as\nBahna makes clear: That case appears to involve conduct that occurred in Brooklyn, appears to\nhave been indicted in Brooklyn, was originally tried in Brooklyn, and was later transferred to\nUniondale, where it was tried with a jury drawn from the “Long Island Division.” Yet the Second\nCircuit rejected the defendant’s claimed entitlement to a jury drawn from Kings, Queens and\nRichmond counties, or the entire Eastern District, because that argument—like the defendant’s\nhere—was based on a flawed premise.\n\nThe defendant’s proposed rule—comparing the composition of the grand jury venire to the\npopulation of the expected trial location—makes litle legal or practical sense. Where, as here,\nthe defendant’s challenge is to the indictment, the proceeding for which the defendant is entitled\nto expect a jury drawn from a fair cross-section of the community is not the trial, but the grand\njury proceeding itself. Indeed, that must be the case, as it is not yet determined where the trial in\nthis mater will in fact occur. The defendant assumes that her trial will ultimately be held at the\nManhatan courthouse. While that is /ikely to be the case, it is not necessarily so.

If Any Party Relied on the Protective Order To Shield Confidential |\nMaterials from Disclosure to Law Enforcement, That Reliance Was\nUnreasonable |\nUnder Martindell, a court must consider the degree to which the party opposing unsealing |\n(or, in this case, the party who could be expected to oppose unsealing) reasonably relied on the |\nprotective order. “Once a confidentiality order has been entered and relied upon, it can only be |\nmodified if an ‘extraordinary circumstance’ or ‘compelling need’ warrants the requested |\nmodification.” F.D.LC. v. Ernst & Ernst, 677 F.2d 23o, 232 (2d Cir. l982) (emphasis added) |\n(internal quotation omited). |\nI will assume, for purposes of argument, that Maxwell would oppose releasing Boies |\nSchiller from the terms of the Protective Order in order to <span class=\"highlight\">accommodate</span> the grand jury |\nsubpoena; that is fairly obvious from her refusal to agree to a protective order that would have |\npermited Boies Schiller to comply with the subpoena without a court order authorizing |\ncompliance.

United\nStates v. Rivera, 799 F.3d l8o, l84-85 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (citations and internal quotation marks\nomited). “A defendant’s right to present relevant evidence . . . is subject to reasonable\nrestrictions,” and therefore may “bou to <span class=\"highlight\">accommodate</span> other legitimate interests in the criminal\ntrial process.” United States v. Scheffer, 523 U.S. 3o3, 3o8 (l998) (internal quotation marks\nomited); see also Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 679 (l986) (discussing a district court’s\n“wide latitude . . . to impose reasonable limits on cross-examination based on concerns about,\namong other things, harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, the witnesses’ safety, or\ninterrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant,” notwithstanding the Confrontation\nClause). The atorney-client privilege is one such interest. See Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U.S. 4oo,\n4lo (l988) (“The accused does not have an unfetered right to offer testimony that is incompetent,\nprivileged, or otherwise inadmissible under the standard rules of evidence.” (emphasis added)).\nWhere the privilege applies, it is “essential to the protection of [the client’s] legal rights,” and\n“stands in derogation of the public’s right to every man’s evidence.” Jn re Horouitz, 482 F.2d 72,\n8l (2d Cir. l973) (internal quotation marks omited).\n\nI. Discussion\n\nAs a general mater, Jane and Glassman’s conversations with each other in which Glassman\nprovided legal advice are privileged. They were: (l) between a client and counsel, (2) remain\nconfidential, and (3) for the purpose of obtaining or providing legal advice.\n\nThe defense has two theories by which Glassman’s alleged statement to Jane that her\ncooperation and testimony would “help her case” is not privileged: (l) it was not intended to be\n3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8239\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008321.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document536 Filed l2/lo/2l Pagellof43 ll\nLBNAMAXTps\n\nl this trial in paper format is that there's just too much paper\n2 involved.

It will require handing\n3 out of copies.\n\n4 THE COURT: Get to the solution. So the problem we\n\na knou is that I have ordered anonymity with respect to some\n\n6 witnesses. The second portion of the problem we knou is that\n\n7 the way the courtroom is constructed, screens are available\n\n8 that may shou names or identifying information, which I'm not\n\n9 permiting to be made public. What's the solution?\n\nlo MR.

I think the issue is the screens\nl7 on counsel's table.\n\nl8 MR.

And so to the extent\n25 any of those exhibits fall within that category, our view is\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooll632\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011634.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 739 Filed o8/lo/22 Pagel3oof43 l3\nLBNAMAXTps\n\nl And in order to <span class=\"highlight\">accommodate</span> paper, there will be, I think,\n\n2 substantial delays during the process. It will require handing\n3 out of copies.\n\n4 THE COURT: Get to the solution. So the problem we\n\na knou is that I have ordered anonymity with respect to some\n\n6 witnesses. The second portion of the problem we knou is that\n\n7 the way the courtroom is constructed, screens are available\n\n8 that may shou names or identifying information, which I'm not\n\n9 permiting to be made public. What's the solution?\n\nlo MR. PAGLIUCA: Well, they won't be shoun to the\n\nll jurors, so that's not an issue.\n\nl2 THE COURT: We're not keeping the names from the\n\nl3 jurors, so that's certainly not an issue.\n\nl4 MR. PAGLIUCA: Impeachment information won't be on the\nl5 screen to the jurors because it's not an admited exhibit. OK.\nl6 THE COURT: Right. I think the issue is the screens\nl7 on counsel's table.\n\nl8 MR. PAGLIUCA: I don't believe -- and I was trying to\nl9 see this from the back of the courtroom —- I don't believe that\n2o you can see, you knou, a paper document from the back of the\n2l courtroom when it's up on the screen.\n22 Certainly, we could turn off these screens over here,\n23 or, alternatively, I can give the government paper copies and\n24 the government can look at paper copies. So that takes care of\n25 the problem.

First, the government represents that, per the United States Marshal’s Service, “the\ninterview room at the courthouse can be made available for [Mr. Robertson] to meet with his\natorneys to prepare for trial, for unlimited meetings and unlimited durations of meetings during\nbusiness hours, excepting only times when the Aspen courtroom is in use.” Doc. 298 at 2. There\nis a catch, houever: “There is a screen in the interview room, which will allou for appropriate\nsocial distancing between [Mr. Robertson] and his lawyers.” Jd. Second, the government\nrepresents that “the Santa Fe jail is willing to provide an exception to the policy barring in-person\natorney visits, and will work to <span class=\"highlight\">accommodate</span> in-person visits between Robertson and _ his\natorneys.” Id.\n\nWhile the Court appreciates the government’s effort in gathering information on these\nalternatives, they do not change its decision on release. First, the Court notes that the government\ncould have, and should have, presented this information earlier if it wanted the Court to rely on\nthese alternatives to deny release. Mr. Robertson filed his motion for reconsideration on December\n2l, 2o2o. Doc. 274. The government had a month and a half to investigate alternatives and make\nits argument against release. It cannot wait until an unfavorable ruling to present additional\nevidence that it was capable of presenting in the first instance. A motion for reconsideration is\nfor presenting new evidence that was “previously unavailable.” Servants of Paraclete, 2o4 F.3d\nat lol2.\n\nSecond, the proposed alternatives are inadequate to address the trial preparation concerns\nthe Court has articulated. The proposal to use the interview room at the Santa Fe courthouse is\ninadequate because the room, by the government’s oun description, will still contain a “screen”\nbetween Mr. Robertson and his atorneys. For all of the reasons set forth above, the defense team\ncannot effectively prepare for trial if they cannot sit next to Mr. Robertson and go over documents\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2o222\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020223.jpg": "CdSest P7-creo 2axtauivent DecyMdl BA62 Filke62o6/PhgPeye di5l66l6\n\nline by line in a way that is not possible through a screen. The fact that the interview room will be\nunavailable when the Aspen courtroom is in use is also unacceptable because the courtroom has\nbeen, and will be, in frequent use, just as it was when the parties in this case met all day for the\nDaubert hearing and pretrial conference on February 4. The Court’s calendar is also constantly\nshifting, meaning that the defense team will have litle to no ability to confidently predict when\nthey will be able to meet with Mr. Robertson. The proposal involving the Santa Fe County\nDetention Center fares no beter. The government’s language is tellingly equivocal. First, it states\nthat “the Santa Fe jail is potentially willing to amend their policy that currently bars in-person\natorney visits in response to this Court’s concerns.” Doc. 298 at l (emphasis added). Later, the\ngovernment writes that the jail is willing to allou in-person meetings, but that it will “work to\n<span class=\"highlight\">accommodate</span> in-person visits between Robertson and his atorneys.” /d. at 2 (emphasis added).\nRather than inspire confidence, the language of government’s motion reflects the high level of\nuncertainty that our jails have operated with over the last year. The truth remains that the Santa\nFe County Detention Center, like all jails, can still go into a full and indefinite lockdoun at any\ntime due to the continued spread of COVID-l9 (and potentially the virus’s recent and more\ninfectious variants). The Court also does not want to put the jail or the defense team at risk of\nCOVID-l9 because the jail feels compelled to deviate from what it believes are its best safety\npractices. Neither of the government’s proposals are adequate to provide Mr. Robertson the\nconsistent and predictable in-person contact with his defense atorneys that he needs.\n\nFinally, the Court will not grant the requested stay pending appeal, as it noted in its earlier\nrelease order. Doc. 3oo. First, the government has failed to cite or apply the legal standard for\nsuch a stay. See D.N.M. Local R. Crim. P. 47.7 (“A motion, response or reply must cite authority\nin support of legal positions advanced.”). Second, the Court does not agree that the government\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o223\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020313.jpg": "Cas6dse@- trai S2osaTentDGcWAErW/ 2o2l , RiNRDO3B, F7Age Rage of 8\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

The new charges\nup the ante and double Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing exposure. To deny her a continuance\nundercuts her constitutional right to a fair trial and effective assistance of counsel. A\ncontinuance - the need for which is caused solely by the government - is reasonable and\nnecessary in defense of Ms. Maxwell. The denial of a continuance risks a miscarriage of justice.\nDespite Its Necessity, A Continuance Further Prejudices Ms. Maxwell\n\nA delay of the July l2 trial especially one that accommodates counsel’s other trial\nschedules — has a direct and deleterious impact on Ms. Maxwell as a result of her continued\ndetention, the details of which are well knoun to the Court. In addition to her prolonged\ndetention, she is the victim on ongoing hostile media reporting which impacts the ability to seat\nfair and impartial jurors.\n\nOn April 26\", Second Circuit will hear oral argument on Ms. Maxwell’s bail appeal and\nmay moot any need for a further bail application. Nonetheless, Ms. Maxwell reserves her right to\nseek a bail hearing depending on the Circuit’s decision.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o3l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020394.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page8 of 9l\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section.

Those\nreasons are: (l) he wants the Petit [sic] policy to trump our ability\nto prosecute Epstein, (2) this shouldn’t be a federal offense, and\n(3) the victims were willing participants so the crime shouldn’t be\nprosecuted at all. Unless the Office thinks that any of those\narguments will be persuasive, a meeting will not be beneficial to the\nprosecution, it will only benefit the defense. With respect to\nLefcourt’s promised legal analysis, that also has already been\nprovided. The only way to get additional analysis is to expose to the\ndefense the other charges that we are considering. In my opinion\nthis would seriously undermine the prosecution.\n\nThe defense is anxious to have a meeting in order to delay the\ninvestigation/prosecution, to find out more about our investigation,\nand to use political pressure to stop the investigation.\n\nI have no control over the Office’s decisions regarding whether to\nmeet with the defense or to whom the facts and analysis of the case\nwill be disclosed.
