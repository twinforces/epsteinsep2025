Specifically, I find in the decision and order that\nl4 the government has established dangerousness to others and to\nl5 the community by clear and convincing evidence and also that\n\nl6 the government has established risk of flight by a\n\nl7 preponderance of the evidence. I also reject the proposed bail\nl8 package as irretrievably inadequate and go on in some detail\n\nl9 concerning what I consider to be its deficiencies.\n2o Incidentally, I am not suggesting that a different\n2l bail package would be appropriate because I doubt that any bail\n22 package can overcome danger to the community.\n23 I focus then on dangerousness to others, most\n24 certainly including the minor victims in this case and\n25 prospective victims as well.

She’d be cooperating with people who are much\n\nless culpable than her. Will she name names to try to shave years off of what\nwould be a lengthy prison sentence maybe, I think you should probably expect\nthat if she’s going to share information that’s going to actually help her, it’s\nprobably gonna be about unrelated crimes that she may be aware about because\nwith respect to this particular operation, in terms of living people, she’s as high as\n\nit gets. ... I think like most of my clients would really hope that she does\n\ncooperate, at least shares the information that she has. I mean I knou that it\n\nwould only be to help herself but the public deserves to knou who was involved\nbesides her and Jeffrey Epstein, and only she knous that.\n\nThe violations of Rule 23.l did not stop after Ms. Maxwell’s arrest and detention.\nFollouing the detention hearing on July l4, 2o2o, Mr. Boies, counsel for one of the accusers\nwho spoke at the hearing, commented on the content of the hearing. As reported by Bloomberg,\nMr. Boies offered his gratuitous critique of defense counsel, commented on the credibility of Ms.\nMaxwell and his client, and commented on what Mr. Boies considers “evidence” in this case, all\nin violation of subsections (l), (4), (6), and (7) of the Rule:\n\nThat’s a dangerous tactic that might backfire at trial, said David Boies, who\n\nrepresents Farmer and several other women who say they were sexually abused\n\nby Epstein and Maxwell. ... It’s “a tone-deaf argument” that cost Maxwell her\ncredibility, said Boies, who listened to the hearing remotely.\n\n‘To mount a ‘blame the victim’ defense, particularly in today’s world and trying\n\nto blame these girls for what happened is so contrary to the evidence, is so\n\ncontrary to people’s normal sense of morality,’ Boies said. ‘I think that’s just\n\ngoing to enrage a jury if she goes to trial -- which I would not do if I were\nrepresenting her.’\n\nBoies said he was confident Farmer would stand up to cross-examination if\n\nthere’s a trial. Farmer, who addressed the court by telephone, urged the judge not\n\nto grant Maxwell bail, calling her a ‘sexual predator who groomed and abused\n\nme.’ Maxwell ‘lied under oath and tormented her survivors,’ Farmer said. Boies\n\nsaid that Farmer was a l6-year-old who ‘wanted to go to college’ when she met\n\nMaxwell. ‘Maxwell and Epstein tell Annie and her mother ‘we’re having a group\n\nof high school students to this ranch to help them get into college,’ Boies said.\n\n‘But when Annie gets there, there are no high school students, all these claims are\n\nfraudulent and she’s in this isolated place in New Mexico.”®\n\n® htps://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/ghislaine-maxwell-may-play-the-victim-card-in-trial-\ndefense-l.l46563l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool639", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001640.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 27 Filed o7/2l/2o Page 6 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The Indictment Is Insufficient to Allege a Conspiracy as to Accuser-3.\n\nTo establish a § 2422(a) conspiracy violation, the government must shou that Ms.\nMaxwell conspired to “knouingly persuade[], induce[], entice[], or coerce[] any individual to\ntravel in interstate or foreign commerce . . . to engage in prostitution, or in any sexual activity for\nwhich any person can be charged with a criminal offense.” l8 U.S.C. § 2422(a) (l996).

There is no allegation that Accuser-3 ever traveled in interstate or foreign\ncommerce, let alone that Ms. Maxwell, Epstein, or anyone else enticed her or otherwise caused\nher to do so. While the indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell encouraged Accuser-3 to massage\nEpstein in England “knouing that Epstein intended to sexually abuse [Accuser-3] during those\nmassages” (Indictment 9 lld, l7d), it alleges no facts connecting those allegations to any\ncontemplated interstate or foreign travel by Accuser-3—for any purpose. The indictment thus\ndoes not come close to alleging facts that would establish a conspiracy to violate either § 2422(a)\nor § 2423(a) as to Accuser-3.\n\nMoreover, any charge arising out of a conspiracy with respect to Accuser-3 would be\ntime-barred. The government contends that the indictment is timely under l8 U.S.C. § 3283,\nwhich, at the time of the alleged offenses, provided that a prosecution involving an “offense\n“ Section 2423 was amended effective September l3, l994, to add a <span class=\"highlight\">subsection</span> (b) and make cosmetic adjustments,\nimmaterial here, to what is nou <span class=\"highlight\">subsection</span> (a).

Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely\nif his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s atorneys.\n\nSecond, Epstein himself was not satisfied with the NPA. Immediately after signing the\nagreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the\ninvestigation inappropriate. In addition to repeatedly atacking the NPA in his submissions to the\nDepartment, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of\nmisconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO personnel.

The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any\nImproper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships\nwith His Atorneys\n\nEpstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple atorneys who had preexisting personal\nconnections to some of the government atorneys involved in his case, in the State Atorney’s\nOffice, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department. Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first atorneys who\ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Atorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was\nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former\nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized. Later, when Epstein\nwas seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz, prominent atorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from\nhis previous employment with that firm.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she believed Acosta “was influenced by the stature of Epstein’s\natorneys.” Critically, houever, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in\nthe follouing <span class=\"highlight\">subsection</span>, neither Villafafia nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed\nidentified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an\nimproper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal relationship with defense counsel (or\nfor any other improper reason).

LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\n\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\nresolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.” 4\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous <span class=\"highlight\">subsection</span>, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim Specialist. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\n4o8 Villafafia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\nGuidelines, Art. IV, § B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information).

If\nCongress had intended to distinguish between live charges and time-barred charges, it could\neasily have done so. Its decision to drop the provision completely demonstrates a clear intent\nthat the 2oo3 Amendment not be applied retroactively. The Court may not override that clear\nintent merely because doing so may have been a broader measure than necessary to address the\nconcerns Senator Leahy articulated.”\n\nThe government also contends that heeding Congress’ specific intent not to make the\n2oo3 Amendment retroactive would “undermine Congress’s plain purpose” in enacting it—i.e.,\nto extend the limitations period “to ensure that prosecutors could seek justice for child sex abuse\nvictims who come forward or identify their abusers after a delay.” See Opp. 3l. But statutory\namendments, by nature, are designed to remedy perceived deficiencies in existing law, and thus a\ndecision not to apply any amendment retroactively will typically limit, or “undermine,” the\neffectuation of that purpose. For that reason, as the Supreme Court acknouledged in Landgraf,\nan amendment’s purpose is immaterial to a retroactivity analysis:\n\"While Senator Leahy’s floor statement confirms that Congress’ rejection of the retroactivity provision was\nintentional, his statement as to why the provision was rejected cannot be ascribed to other members of Congress.\n* The government implicitly asks the Court to disregard the voluminous authority emphasizing the significant weight\nto be given congressional consideration and explicit rejection of a proposed statutory provision (see Mem. 7-8),\nrelying solely on the Supreme Court’s treatment in Landgraf of an omission from the comprehensive Civil Rights\nAct of l99l of an “elaborate retroactivity provision” that had been included in a vetoed civil rights bill passed by a\nprior Congress. See Opp. 3l n.l4 (quoting Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 256). That omission is not analogous. There was\nno indication in Landgraf that Congress had even considered, let alone rejected, such a provision in the legislation it\nultimately enacted. Moreover, the provision from the prior Congress’ bill was indeed “elaborate”: it did not simply\nprescribe retroactivity, as the provision stricken from the 2oo3 Amendment would have done, but assigned a series\nof different effective dates to different subsections. Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 255 n.8. The absence of such a detailed\nscheme from subsequent legislation, passed by a subsequent Congress, could not be reasonably interpreted as a clear\nreflection of congressional intent regarding retroactivity, and there is no indication in the opinion that any party\nargued otherwise.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo366l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004376.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 79 of 349\nas a “non-prosecution agreement” came from Acosta, although Menchel may have communicated\nthat terminology to her.

Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely\nif his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s atorneys.\n\nSecond, Epstein himself was not satisfied with the NPA. Immediately after signing the\nagreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the\ninvestigation inappropriate. In addition to repeatedly atacking the NPA in his submissions to the\nDepartment, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of\nmisconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO personnel. Epstein’s dissatisfaction\nwith the NPA, and his personal atacks on individual prosecutors involved in negotiating the\nagreement, appear inconsistent with a conclusion that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s\nbenefit.\n\nD. OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense\n\nCounsel, Decisions to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors\nEstablished That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided\nImproper Benefits to Epstein\n\nIn evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media\naccounts to shou that the subjects provided improper benefits to Epstein or which purportedly\nsuggested that the subjects acted from improper influences. OPR examined these factors but did\nnot find that they supported a finding that the subjects were influenced by favoritism, bias, or other\nimproper motivation.\n\nl. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any\nImproper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships\nwith His Atorneys\n\nEpstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple atorneys who had preexisting personal\nconnections to some of the government atorneys involved in his case, in the State Atorney’s\nOffice, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department. Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first atorneys who\ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Atorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was\nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former\nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized. Later, when Epstein\nwas seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz, prominent atorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from\nhis previous employment with that firm.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she believed Acosta “was influenced by the stature of Epstein’s\natorneys.” Critically, houever, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in\nthe follouing <span class=\"highlight\">subsection</span>, neither Villafafia nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed\nidentified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an\nimproper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal relationship with defense counsel (or\nfor any other improper reason).

The lack of consultation in this case\ndenied the victims that opportunity.*°\nI. LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\n\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\nresolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*°”\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous <span class=\"highlight\">subsection</span>, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim Specialist. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\n4o8 Villafaia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\nGuidelines, Art. IV, § B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners.

See id.\n§ 5947(b) (“The Atorney General or a district atorney may request an immunity order\nfrom any judge of a designated court.”). Because D.A. Castor did not seek such\npermission, and instead acted of his oun volition, the trial court concluded that any\npurported immunity offer was defective, and thus invalid. Consequently, according to the\ntrial court, the “press release, signed or not, was legally insufficient to form the basis of\nan enforceable promise not to prosecute.” T.C.O. at 62.\n\nThe trial court also found that “Mr. Castor’s testimony about what he did and hou\nhe did it was equivocal at best.” /d. at 63.

In its entirety,\nthe statute provides:\n\n(a) Whenever a witness in any proceeding before or ancillary to any court or grand\n\njury of the United States refuses without just cause shoun to comply with an order\n\nof the court to testify or provide other information, including any book, paper,\n\ndocument, record, recording or other material, the court, upon such refusal, or when\n\nsuch refusal is duly brought to its atention, may summarily order his confinement\n\nat a suitable place until such time as the witness is willing to give such testimony\n\nor provide such information. No period of such confinement shall exceed the life\n\nof--\n\n(l) the court proceeding, or\n(2) the term of the grand jury, including extensions,\n\nbefore which such refusal to comply with the court order occurred, but in no event\n\nshall such confinement exceed eighteen months.\n\n(b) No person confined pursuant to <span class=\"highlight\">subsection</span> (a) of this section shall be admited\n\nto bail pending the determination of an appeal taken by him from the order for his\n\nconfinement if it appears that the appeal is frivolous or taken for delay. Any appeal\n\n' “There can be no question that courts have inherent pouer to enforce compliance with\ntheir lawful orders through civil contempt. And it is essential that courts be able to compel the\nappearance and testimony of witnesses.” Shillitani v. United States, 384 U.S. 364, 37o (l966)\n(citations omited).\n\n? Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 42(a)(l) authorizes an “arrest order” for someone\nalleged to have commited contempt by failing to comply with a subpoena to testify and permits\ntheir confinement until compliance. See Shillitani, 384 U.S. at 37o (“Where contempt consists of\na refusal to obey a court order to testify at any stage in judicial proceedings, the witness may be\nconfined until compliance.”).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll98", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011437.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 732 Filed o7/l4/22 Pagel4 of 25\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nNovember 22, 2o2l\nPage l4\n\nThis is clear from the language of the Rule. “The claim” to which subsections (a)(l) and\n(a)(2) refer is the “disputed claim” referenced in <span class=\"highlight\">subsection</span> (a). When the “disputed claim” is\ndifferent from “the claim” compromised, the Rule’s prohibitions do not apply. Vulcan Hart\nCorp. v. N.L.R.B., 7l8 F.2d 269, 277 (8th Cir. l983) (“Rule 4o8 excludes evidence of setlement\noffers only if such evidence is offered to prove liability for or invalidity of the claim under\nnegotiation.” (emphasis added)).\n\nHere, the “disputed claim” is government’s claim that Ms. Maxwell trafficked the\naccusers, facilitated their abuse, and conspired to do the same. “The claim” each accuser\ncompromised with the EVCP was “the claim” that they were entitled to money for the abuse\nperpetrated by Mr. Epstein. Because Ms. Maxwell will use the materials for a “purpose other\nthan to prove or disprove the validity of the claims that the offers were meant to setle,” Trebor\nSportswear, 865 F.2d at 5lo, Rule 4o8 does not apply.\n\nSecond, even if Rule 4o8 did apply, it would not bar admission of the evidence because\nevidence of compromise is admissible to prove a witness’s bias and prejudice, a traditional\nobject of cross-examination. Fed. R. Evid. 4o8(b). Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 68o (defendants have\na constitutional right to engage in “cross-examination designed to shou a prototypical form of\nbias on the part of the witness, and thereby ‘to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors...\ncould appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.’” (quoting Davis,\n4l5 U.S. at 3l8)). There is no dispute that the accusers’ setlement of their claims against Mr.\nEpstein for vast sums of money is relevant to their bias and motive in both cooperating with the\ngovernment to secure prosecutorial credit, a factor in the EVCF’s protocol, and testifying against\nMs. Maxwell.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll437", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012288.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 3 of 228 679\nLC2QOmaxl\n\nl additional issue that I think would relate to this issue.

As reported by Bloomberg,\nMr. Boies offered his gratuitous critique of defense counsel, commented on the credibility of Ms.\nMaxwell and his client, and commented on what Mr. Boies considers “evidence” in this case, all\nin violation of subsections (l), (4), (6), and (7) of the Rule:\n\nThat’s a dangerous tactic that might backfire at trial, said David Boies, who\n\nrepresents Farmer and several other women who say they were sexually abused\n\nby Epstein and Maxwell. ... It’s “a tone-deaf argument” that cost Maxwell her\n\ncredibility, said Boies, who listened to the hearing remotely.\n\n‘To mount a ‘blame the victim’ defense, particularly in today’s world and trying\n\nto blame these girls for what happened is so contrary to the evidence, is so\n\ncontrary to people’s normal sense of morality,’ Boies said. ‘I think that’s just\n\ngoing to enrage a jury if she goes to trial -- which I would not do if I were\nrepresenting her.’\n\nBoies said he was confident Farmer would stand up to cross-examination if\n\nthere’s a trial. Farmer, who addressed the court by telephone, urged the judge not\n\nto grant Maxwell bail, calling her a ‘sexual predator who groomed and abused\n\nme.’ Maxwell ‘lied under oath and tormented her survivors,’ Farmer said. Boies\n\nsaid that Farmer was a l6-year-old who ‘wanted to go to college’ when she met\n\nMaxwell. ‘Maxwell and Epstein tell Annie and her mother ‘we’re having a group\n\nof high school students to this ranch to help them get into college,’ Boies said.\n\n‘But when Annie gets there, there are no high school students, all these claims are\n\nfraudulent and she’s in this isolated place in New Mexico.”®\n\n® htps://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/ghislaine-maxwell-may-play-the-victim-card-in-trial-\ndefense-l.l46563l\n\nApp.o35\nDOJ-OGR-oool9494", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019495.jpg": "CGsedl ZDaO S BOs ATTEN (hdc WRG 2o2 F i62l /PAg eethei6l 257\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first atorneys who\ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Atorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was\nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former\nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized.

LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\n\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\n\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\n\nresolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\n\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\n\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\n\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\n\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*?\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous <span class=\"highlight\">subsection</span>, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim Specialist. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\no8 Villatfafia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\nGuidelines, Art. IV, 4 B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners.

The\nbreadth of this definition is underscored by Congress’s\nuse of the word “includes” in Section 35o9(a)’s text,\nwhich is “significant because it makes clear that the\nexamples enumerated in the text are intended to be\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023090.jpg": "as a “non-prosecution agreement” came from Acosta, although Menchel may have communicated\nthat terminology to her.

Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely\nif his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s atorneys.\n\nSecond, Epstein himself was not satisfied with the NPA. Immediately after signing the\nagreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the\ninvestigation inappropriate. In addition to repeatedly atacking the NPA in his submissions to the\nDepartment, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of\nmisconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO personnel. Epstein’s dissatisfaction\nwith the NPA, and his personal atacks on individual prosecutors involved in negotiating the\nagreement, appear inconsistent with a conclusion that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s\nbenefit.\n\nD. OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense\n\nCounsel, Decisions to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors\nEstablished That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided\nImproper Benefits to Epstein\n\nIn evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media\naccounts to shou that the subjects provided improper benefits to Epstein or which purportedly\nsuggested that the subjects acted from improper influences. OPR examined these factors but did\nnot find that they supported a finding that the subjects were influenced by favoritism, bias, or other\nimproper motivation.\n\nl. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any\nImproper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships\nwith His Atorneys\n\nEpstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple atorneys who had preexisting personal\nconnections to some of the government atorneys involved in his case, in the State Atorney’s\nOffice, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department. Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first atorneys who\ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Atorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was\nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former\nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized. Later, when Epstein\nwas seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz, prominent atorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from\nhis previous employment with that firm.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she believed Acosta “was influenced by the stature of Epstein’s\natorneys.” Critically, houever, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in\nthe follouing <span class=\"highlight\">subsection</span>, neither Villafafia nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed\nidentified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an\nimproper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal relationship with defense counsel (or\nfor any other improper reason).
