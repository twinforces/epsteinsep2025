Erotomatic delusions involve irrational, unsubstantiated, or impossible\nclaims that some person is in love with the delusional individual. The\nindividual may claim that a movie star or superior at work is secretly\nin love with him or her and that there is a spiritual tie between them.\nAnother delusional theme of interest is the persecutory type. This delu-\nsional theme is characterized by irrational, unsubstantiated, or impossible\nclaims that the individual has been wronged and that some injustice has\ntaken place. Frequent appeals to the court system are common in which the\nindividual atempts to persecute the central person in the delusion. Mixed\ntypes of delusions involve delusions in which no one type predominates.\nA mixed erotomatic and persecutory type might be the type of delusion that\nwould lead to a false allegation of sexual assault. Houever, delusions can\nbe complex and difficult to categorize, even when they are sexual in nature.\n\nStudies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions that\nare sexual in nature are not uncommon and are occur more often in women\nthan in men (Galdos & van Os, l995; Meloy, l989). Some cases of sexual\ndelusions have been documented. In one case, Rosenthal and McGuinness\n(l986), two psychiatric nurses, wrote about a client with delusions cen-\ntered on sex. “When her hydrotherapist offered her a backrub one day,\nshe exclaimed, ‘Don’t touch me! I am not your homosexual lover’’(p. l49).\nThese delusions may lead a person to claim adamantly that sexual relations\nor events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\nDissociation\nDissociation is “the lack of the normal <span class=\"highlight\">integration</span> of thoughts, feel-\nings, and experiences into the stream of consciousness and memory”\n(Berstein & Putnam, l986). According to the DSM-IV-TR (American\nPsychiatric Association, 2ooo), dissociation involves a disruption or spliting\noff of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient.\nCurrently, there is some controversy concerning the function, antecedents\nand etiology of dissociation (Candel, Merckelbach, & Kuijpers, 2oo3).\n\nDissociative tendencies have been thought to exist as a stable trait\nin some individuals (Waller, Putnam, & Carlson, l996), though most\nresearch has looked only at dissociation in relation to traumatic expe-\nriences. Much of the focus on the relationship between trauma and\ndissociation may be the result of earlier studies that found a relationship\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6287\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006294.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 26 of 29\n\nl2o J.

Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\nIntellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may\nalso complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.\n\nChanges in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in\ndetermining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2ol5) conducted a\nnarrative analysis of l47 sets of allegations of sexual assault across short (3 month) and long (6\nmonth) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing literature, Peace\nand colleagues found that genuine traumatic experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to\ndrastic impairments in recall. Houever, some inconsistencies especially in less core maters are\nto be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their\nsample of l47 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more\ndetail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers\nfound that fabricated allegations of traumatic experiences contained more inconsistent details\nboth at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or\nfalse) does tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers\nfound that the number of details present in genuine reports continued to decrease over time\nwhereas fabricated stories ‘levelled off” in detail.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo75o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007513.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 2o of 375\nAmerican Psychological Association commitee work:\nMember, Communications Commitee, l975-76; Member, Magazine Task Force, l975-76;\nMember, Finance Commitee, l976-78; Member, Comm. on Organization of APA, l977-78;\nCommission on Organization, l978-82; Council of Representatives, Div. 3, l982-85;\nExecutive Commitee, Div. 4l, l98l-85; Member, Ethics Commitee, l984; National\nPolicy Studies Oversight Commitee, l986; Psychology Today, Board of Directors, l987-88;\nComm. on Division/APA Relations (CODAPAR), l988-89, Public Information Comm. l989-l992\nTask Force on Recovered Memories of Child Sexual Abuse, l993-96\nAssociation for Psychological Science (Formerly American Psychological Society) Commitee work:\nFund for Advancement of Psychological Science, Board Member, 2oo3- .

Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\nIntellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may\nalso complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.\n\nChanges in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in\ndetermining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2ol5) conducted a\nnarrative analysis of l47 sets of allegations of sexual assault across short (3 month) and long (6\nmonth) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing literature, Peace\nand colleagues found that genuine traumatic experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to\ndrastic impairments in recall. Houever, some inconsistencies especially in less core maters are\nto be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their\nsample of l47 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more\ndetail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers\nfound that fabricated allegations of traumatic experiences contained more inconsistent details\nboth at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or\nfalse) does tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers\nfound that the number of details present in genuine reports continued to decrease over time\nwhereas fabricated stories ‘levelled off” in detail.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o8o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020100.jpg": "Castat2o4c68oB3oANent DecumeiWeo4 , FIlGASH)lBade4Pagfel Bf 4\n\nLarticle 3 du Traite bilateral d’extradition signe le 23 avril l996 entre les Etats-Unis\nd’Amerique et la France stipule que «/Etat requis n'est pas tenu daccorder Textradition de l'un de ses\nressortassants, mais le Pouvoir executif des Etats-Unis a la Jaculte de te faire, discretionnairement, sil le fuse\napproprie ».\n\nEn application de ce Traite et du principe general de non-extradition des nationaux en dtoit\nfrancais, la France tefuse systematiquement d’accorder Vextradition de ressortissants francais aux\nautorites judiciaires americaines tandis que les autorites americaines acceptent regulierement d’extrader\nleurs ressortissants vers la France.\n\nIl convient de faire observer que le principe de non-extradition des nationaux vaut non\nseulement a legard des Etats-Unis mais egalement de tous les autres Etats A Pexception des Etats-\nmembres de Union europeenne, aux termes de la loi du 9 mars 2oo4 transposant la decision-cadre\ndu l3 juin 2oo2 sur le mandat d’arret europeen qui prevoit que la remise de la personne reclamee ne\npourra pas etre refusee au seul motif de sa nationalite francaise.\n\nCe temperament au principe de non-extradition des nationaux s’inscrit dans le contexte\npaticulier de la construction de espace judiciaire europeen qui s’inscrit lui-meme dans un processus\nd’<span class=\"highlight\">integration</span> politique tres specifique entre les Etats-membres de l’Union europeenne.
