Chapter V of the French Code of Criminal Procedure (Articles 696 to 696-47-l) sets out\nlegislative provisions pertaining to extradition.\n\n53. The rule against the extradition of nationals is set out under Article 696-4, which states\nthat extradition shall not be granted when the requested person is a French national, and\nthat nationality shall be assessed at the time of the facts in respect of which extradition\nis sought (« Extradition is not granted: l° When the person sought has the French\nnationality, the later being assessed at the time of the offence for which extradition is\nrequested. »»”’),\n\n54. The rule under Article 696-4 only applies “in the absence of an international\nconvention stipulating otherwise”*®, Therefore, we must determine whether the rule\nagainst the extradition of nationals contained in the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure applies in respect of an extradition request made by the USA.\n\n55. Extradition requests between the United States and France are governed by the\nExtradition Treaty between the USA and France l996”, which supersedes French law\nas mentioned explicitly in Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure.\n\n56. Article 3(l) of the Extradition Treaty between France and the United States provides:\n\n“There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the extradition of a\nperson who is a national of the Requested State, but the executive authority of the\nUnited States shall have the pouer to surrender a national of the United States if,\nin its discretion, it deems it proper to do so.

In fact,\nundersigned counsel and Ms. Maxwell’s trial team have been very careful to keep the\nrepresentation separate. I have not been provided any of the trial discovery.\n\nThe local rules do not and could not reach lawyers who do not represent a client\n(or witness) in a pending case because of the First Amendment. Gentile v. State Bar of\nNevada, 5ol U.S. lo3o, lo74 (l99l) (stating that “lawyers representing clients in\npending cases may be <span class=\"highlight\">regulated</span>” by substantial prejudice standard and not\nheightened general First Amendment standard of clear danger) (emphasis added); id.\nat lo76 (“The regulation of atorneys’ speech is limited—it applies only to speech that\nis substantially likely to have a materially prejudicial effect ... applying equally to all\natorneys participating in a pending case’) (emphasis added); see also United\nStates v. Broun, 2l8 F.3d 4l5 (5th Cir. 2ooo) (discussing the factors to consider in\nentering a gag order for “trial participants’).\n\nThe Government, houever, argues that because Local Rule 23.l(a) states that\nlawyers “associated” with the “pending criminal litigation” are subject to the\nrestrictions in local rules, the rule applies to undersigned counsel because of the\nappellate litigation in the Second Circuit regarding bail. As explained above, that\nlitigation is concluded. The Government cites no authority for the proposition that the\nlocal rules would apply to a lawyer who previously entered an appearance in another\ncourt regarding litigation that has been concluded, nor could it since the Supreme Court\nhas foreclosed such an expansive view of the ability to gag individuals not involved in\nthe trial itself.\n\nRecognizing the weakness of its position, the Government states that because I\nasked for permission to bring my cell phone into the courtroom for the arraignment,! I\nmust be associated with the litigation. But that example disproves the Government’s\nclaim that I am associated with this case. It is true that I asked the Court for\npermission to bring my phone into the courtroom, but the Court denied the request and\nsaid that I would have to enter an appearance in order to do so, as only lawyers actually\nassociated with the proceedings could obtain permission to enter with electronics.\nBecause I had not entered an appearance for Ms. Maxwell in this Court, I was not given\nsuch permission.\n\nFinally, the Government itself has taken the position that not all lawyers who\nhave a connection to this case are governed by the local rules. For example, Ms.\nMaxwell’s trial lawyers brought to the Government’s atention that one of the accuser’s\nl At that time, I represented Ms. Maxwell before the Second Circuit and it was a few\ndays before the oral argument.
