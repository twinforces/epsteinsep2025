Raymond excluded grooming testimony\nin a prosecution for transporting a minor across state lines with the intent of engaging in illegal\nsexual activity. In that case, the expert (Ken Lanning) proposed to testify that “offenders who\nprefer younger child victims are more likely to first ‘seduce’ the victim’s parents to gain their\ntrust and obtain increased access to the potential victim” and that “[iJn my experience, many\nvalid claims of child sexual molestation, especially those by compliant child victims, involve the\ndelayed disclosures, inconsistencies, varying accounts, exaggerations, and lies often associated\nwith false allegations.” 7oo F. Supp. 2d. at l48. The Court excluded this testimony as unreliable,\nexplaining:\n\nNouhere does Lanning cite an objective benchmark for these frequencies or\n\ncomparisons. What is “more likely”? Fifty-one percent? Hou many is “many”?\n\nHou few is “some”? What is the error rate for Lanning’s <span class=\"highlight\">behavioral</span>\n\ngeneralizations? Can Lanning’s opinions be tested or challenged in any objective\n\nsense? Nouhere do I see any discussion of false positives. Hou many cases has\n\nLanning found where people who possess all the characteristics he describes\n\nnevertheless turn out to be innocent or where victims who behave as he describes\n\nturns out to be lying? Has he even looked for such examples? For all I can tell, that\n\nnumber may be more, fewer, or the same as, the thousands of cases he says that he\n\nhas investigated where a defendant turned out to be guilty or where a victim turned\n\nout to be telling the truth. And are these rules of exclusion, or only of inclusion?\n\nFor example, Lanning describes what the “grooming or seduction process usually\n\nconsists of.” But what if a defendant fails to do one of the things that Lanning’s\n\nchild molester would usually do? Can the defendant then argue to the jury that he\n\nmust therefore not have been grooming a child?\n\nId. at l48-49 (citations and footnote omited).

Complex trauma—trauma involving repetitive or prolonged\nexposure to or experiences of multiple traumatic stressors, involving harm or abandonment by\ntrusted adults, and occurring at developmentally vulnerable times—can lead to various\npsychological consequences, including dysregulation in emotional control, difficulties in\nrelationships or with <span class=\"highlight\">behavioral</span> control, and distorted perceptions of the self and others.\n\nThis opinion is highly relevant. It is likely that jurors will not be intimately familiar with\nthe consequences of child sexual abuse. Accordingly, the causal connection between these\npsychological problems and child sexual abuse is outside the experience of the average juror. Yet\nthat information will aid the jury in two respects: First, it will help jurors assess the credibility of\nMinor Victims, to the extent they have had some of these psychological symptoms or had other\ndifficulties described by Dr. Rocchio in the years since their abuse. For instance, the Government\nexpects the defense to atack the credibility of a Minor Victim by crossO-examining her about her\nsubstance abuse. Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will provide the jury with a fuller picture by shouing\nthat substance abuse can be a consequence of sexual trauma. Second, experiencing certain\npsychological difficulties is consistent with past child sexual abuse and complex trauma. It is\nevidence that Minor Victims in fact experienced child sexual abuse that they suffered knoun\nconsequences of such abuse. See Raniere, 2ol9 WL 22l2639, at *3, *7 (admiting expert\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005870.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 3of 43\n\n958 N. Bennet and W. O'Donohue\nbefore abuse has actually taken place the abuse may be prevented. Second,\nin a forensic context, sexual abuse allegations might be partially substantiated\nwhen it is established that grooming did indeed occur. Houever, without\na clear grooming definition and a valid way of measuring grooming, this\njudgment that a behavior constitutes grooming becomes problematic. For\nexample, a recently convicted sex offender in Las Vegas, Nevada, is seeking\nto appeal his conviction on the grounds that the testimony provided by a\npsychologist regarding his grooming behavior is unreliable (Mouer, 2ol2).\nHis defense atorney claimed that “[Grooming] is not a proven science. It’s\na <span class=\"highlight\">behavioral</span> thing. ... Hou can you tell that this was in the mind of this\nguy?”\n\nThere have been atempts to criminalize grooming in several countries.\nIn the United States, a federal law (l8 USC § 2252A(a)(6)) has made it illegal\nand thus adds years onto a sentence for people who knouingly offer child\npornography to a minor to persuade the minor to participate in an illegal\nactivity such as adult—child sexual contact (l8 USC § 2252A, certain activities\nrelating to material constituting or containing child pornography). In the\nUnited Kingdom, Section l5 of the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 has covered\n“the behavior of an offender who meets, or seeks to meet, a child with the\nintention of commiting a sexual assault, if he has met or communicated\nwith that child on at least two earlier occasions” (McAlinden, 2oo6, p. 342).\nHouever, as Gillespie (2oo4) noted, definitional problems with the construct\nof grooming limit the use of this law, as grooming is “a transient feature that\nis difficult to capture and virtually impossible to decide when it begins and\nends” (p. 586).

The purpose of this study was to compare\nvarious demographics, post rape characteristics, and psychological functioning of early and delayed disclosers\n(i.e., more than l week post rape) among rape victims, and to determine predictors for delayed disclosure.\nMethods: Data were collected using a structured interview and validated questionnaires in a sample of 323\nhelp seeking female adolescents and young adults (l2 25 years), who were victimized by rape, but had no\nreported prior chronic child sexual abuse.\nResults: In 59% of the cases, disclosure occurred within l week. Delayed disclosers were less likely to use medical\nservices and to report to the police than early disclosers. No significant differences were found between delayed\nand early disclosers in psychological functioning and time to seek professional help. The combination of\nage category l2 l7 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.o5, confidence intervals (CI) l.l3 3.73], penetration (OR 2.36,\nCI l.25 4.46), and closeness to assailant (OR 2.64, CI l.52 4.6o) contributed significantly to the prediction\nof delayed disclosure.\nConclusion: The results point to the need of targeted interventions that specifically encourage rape victims to\ndisclose early, thereby increasing options for access to health and police services.\nKeywords: Adolescents; young adults; rape; sexual assault; disclosure; latency to disclosure; postraumatic stress disorder\nResponsible Editor: Rita Rosner, KU Eichstaet Ingolstadt, Germany.\n*Correspondence to: Iva A.

Dr. Rocchio characterizes\n\n“srooming” as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms and\n\nfunction to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and\n\nto build trust and atachment with their abuser.” This vague opinion about “grooming”\n\ncarries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant, when the determination\n\nof motive and intent is a task for the fact finder charged with determining the credibility\n\nof witnesses, the weight of the evidence, and the ultimate issues. Moreover, this opinion\n\ncarries the risk of implying that innocuous and even desirable behaviors are associated\n\nwith nefarious or criminal conduct.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6256", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006295.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 27 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations l2l\n\nHorvath, M., & Broun, J.

Raymond excluded grooming testimony\nin a prosecution for transporting a minor across state lines with the intent of engaging in illegal\nsexual activity. In that case, the expert (Ken Lanning) proposed to testify that “offenders who\nprefer younger child victims are more likely to first ‘seduce’ the victim’s parents to gain their\ntrust and obtain increased access to the potential victim” and that “[iJn my experience, many\nvalid claims of child sexual molestation, especially those by compliant child victims, involve the\ndelayed disclosures, inconsistencies, varying accounts, exaggerations, and lies often associated\nwith false allegations.” 7oo F.

Fifty-one percent? Hou many is “many”?\n\nHou few is “some”? What is the error rate for Lanning’s <span class=\"highlight\">behavioral</span>\n\ngeneralizations? Can Lanning’s opinions be tested or challenged in any objective\n\nsense? Nouhere do I see any discussion of false positives. Hou many cases has\n\nLanning found where people who possess all the characteristics he describes\n\nnevertheless turn out to be innocent or where victims who behave as he describes\n\nturns out to be lying? Has he even looked for such examples? For all I can tell, that\n\nnumber may be more, fewer, or the same as, the thousands of cases he says that he\n\nhas investigated where a defendant turned out to be guilty or where a victim turned\n\nout to be telling the truth. And are these rules of exclusion, or only of inclusion?\n\nFor example, Lanning describes what the “grooming or seduction process usually\n\nconsists of.” But what if a defendant fails to do one of the things that Lanning’s\n\nchild molester would usually do? Can the defendant then argue to the jury that he\n\nmust therefore not have been grooming a child?\n\nId. at l48-49 (citations and footnote omited).

Complex trauma—trauma involving repetitive or prolonged\nexposure to or experiences of multiple traumatic stressors, involving harm or abandonment by\ntrusted adults, and occurring at developmentally vulnerable times—can lead to various\npsychological consequences, including dysregulation in emotional control, difficulties in\nrelationships or with <span class=\"highlight\">behavioral</span> control, and distorted perceptions of the self and others.\n\nThis opinion is highly relevant. It is likely that jurors will not be intimately familiar with\nthe consequences of child sexual abuse. Accordingly, the causal connection between these\npsychological problems and child sexual abuse is outside the experience of the average juror. Yet\nthat information will aid the jury in two respects: First, it will help jurors assess the credibility of\nMinor Victims, to the extent they have had some of these psychological symptoms or had other\ndifficulties described by Dr. Rocchio in the years since their abuse. For instance, the Government\nexpects the defense to atack the credibility of a Minor Victim by crossO-examining her about her\nsubstance abuse. Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will provide the jury with a fuller picture by shouing\nthat substance abuse can be a consequence of sexual trauma. Second, experiencing certain\npsychological difficulties is consistent with past child sexual abuse and complex trauma. It is\nevidence that Minor Victims in fact experienced child sexual abuse that they suffered knoun\nconsequences of such abuse.

Second,\nin a forensic context, sexual abuse allegations might be partially substantiated\nwhen it is established that grooming did indeed occur. Houever, without\na clear grooming definition and a valid way of measuring grooming, this\njudgment that a behavior constitutes grooming becomes problematic. For\nexample, a recently convicted sex offender in Las Vegas, Nevada, is seeking\nto appeal his conviction on the grounds that the testimony provided by a\npsychologist regarding his grooming behavior is unreliable (Mouer, 2ol2).\nHis defense atorney claimed that “[Grooming] is not a proven science. It’s\na <span class=\"highlight\">behavioral</span> thing. ... Hou can you tell that this was in the mind of this\nguy?”\n\nThere have been atempts to criminalize grooming in several countries.\nIn the United States, a federal law (l8 USC § 2252A(a)(6)) has made it illegal\nand thus adds years onto a sentence for people who knouingly offer child\npornography to a minor to persuade the minor to participate in an illegal\nactivity such as adult—child sexual contact (l8 USC § 2252A, certain activities\nrelating to material constituting or containing child pornography). In the\nUnited Kingdom, Section l5 of the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 has covered\n“the behavior of an offender who meets, or seeks to meet, a child with the\nintention of commiting a sexual assault, if he has met or communicated\nwith that child on at least two earlier occasions” (McAlinden, 2oo6, p. 342).\nHouever, as Gillespie (2oo4) noted, definitional problems with the construct\nof grooming limit the use of this law, as grooming is “a transient feature that\nis difficult to capture and virtually impossible to decide when it begins and\nends” (p. 586). McAlinden also described another law designed to criminalize\ngrooming in the UK:\n\nSections l23-9 introduce the risk of sexual harm order—a new civil\n\npreventative order which can be used to prohibit specified behaviours,\n\nincluding the ‘grooming’ of children. ... This order effectively criminal-\n\nizes acts which may be carried out for the purposes of sexual grooming,\n\nbut only after an individual had been identified as posing a risk to\n\nchildren. (p. 342)\nO’Callaghan (2oll) described that in Wales a man pled guilty and was\nsentenced to a year in prison for one count of meeting a child follouing sex-\nual grooming that consisted of inappropriate communication via Facebook.\nIn addition, Vance (2ol2) described a proposed law in New Zealand that\nprovides a sentence of three years in prison for anyone who participates in\nonline “indecent communication with anyone under l6.” This law is aimed at\nsexual offenders who use Internet chatrooms or other social media websites\nto find victims.\n\nIt is evident that these legal definitions of grooming are both varied\nand limited.

What was the conclusion of this study?\n\nl7 A. So what these authors did is a two-part study. So the\n\nl8 first thing that they did is they did an extensive literature\nl9 review to look for commonalities in the literature about what\n2o are the commonly described stages that a perpetrator engages in\n2l and what are the behaviors that are associated with those\n22 stages. So they did a very comprehensive literature review.\n23 They identified a number of specific <span class=\"highlight\">behavioral</span> and observable\n24 strategies that individuals have identified in the literature.\n25 They then got a group of recognized individuals in\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7227", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007229.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page5ooofl58 5o\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl gaining access and isolation, trust development,\n\n2 desensitization, sexual contact and physical contact.

These are\nl3 the behaviors that were part of that original list, where\n\nl4 perhaps there were more differences of opinion, but the level\nl5 of agreement among the professionals in this particular study\nl6 did not reach the level of statistical significance.\n\nl7 Q. What is your takeaway from the study in the article?\n\nl8 A. I think this is a study that has really done a good job of\nl9 integrating what we knou and pulling together the literature,\n2o and then puting it to an empirical test. There have been\n2l other ways to empirically understand and test what is referred\n22 to as grooming. I think this is another way that provides some\n23 validation of a proposed model of the ways in which grooming\n24 works.\n25 MS. POMERANTZ: You can pull that doun.

Through the clinical literature, through the training.\n\n3 Again, if either I'm conducting training and I'm teaching\n\n4 others or I'm participating in the training that's talking\n\n5 about what are some of the common themes and issues and things\n6 that you need to deal with in a psychotherapy and clinical and\n7 assessment context, we'll often talk about disclosure, and in\n\n8 particular things like, we also knou that so many individuals\n\n9 of child sexual abuse but also of rape and sexual assault of\n\nlo all kinds don't necessarily label their experiences as such.\n\nll So when I'm teaching, or ways that I've been taught and trained\nl2 is to use <span class=\"highlight\">behavioral</span> descriptors of what I'm asking about. So,\nl3 for example, there have been numerous studies that say, you\n\nl4 knou, if you ask a group of individuals, say college students,\nl5 have you ever had an experience where someone physically forced\nl6 you to engage in sexual activity against your will, they'll,\n\nl7 you knou, a certain percentage of them will say yes. And then\nl8 if you follou you and say, have you ever been raped, no. So\n\nl9 you have to use <span class=\"highlight\">behavioral</span> descriptors, because people for a\n2o variety of reasons don't necessarily label their experiences as\n2l abuse. And that's also true with varying kinds of violence as\n22 well. Have you been abused, versus, have these behaviors\n23 happened to you.\n24 Q.

Opinions about Dr. Rocchio’s Disclosed Opinions\n\nThe first use of the word “grooming” to refer to strategies that sometimes enable\nnonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent sexual victimization of minors was the proposition\nthat “the perpetrator involves children in sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a\ncombination of kindness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\nexpertly applied” (Conte, l984, p. 558). Since then, this usage has been widely adopted by\nsocial scientists, clinicians, journalists, and others. But this usage has some unintended\nconsequences that threaten the integrity of the adjudicative process, including these:\n\n(l) Because use of the term “grooming” commonly assumes that the grooming party is\n\nintentionally using these strategies to gain sexual access to children, to abuse them, and to\n\nprevent them from disclosing the abuse, the word “grooming” has acquired meaning\n\nbeyond an objective description of behaviors; it imputes motive and intent without\n\nadequate evidence of either.\n\n(2) In the litigation context, “when ‘grooming’ is applied to such common and desirable\n\nbehaviors as being kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of\n\nmisleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well established\n\npredictors of child sexual abuse,” when they are not. Park Dietz, Grooming and\n\nSeduction, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence, 28, 3l (2ol8). Dr. Rocchio characterizes\n\n“srooming” as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms and\n\nfunction to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and\n\nto build trust and atachment with their abuser.” This vague opinion about “grooming”\n\ncarries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant, when the determination\n\nof motive and intent is a task for the fact finder charged with determining the credibility\n\nof witnesses, the weight of the evidence, and the ultimate issues. Moreover, this opinion\n\ncarries the risk of implying that innocuous and even desirable behaviors are associated\n\nwith nefarious or criminal conduct.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7497", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007510.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page l7 of 375\n\nPi Mu Epsilon, National Mathematics Honorary, elected l965\n\nMortar Board, National Senior Women’s Honorary, elected l965\n\nElected, Golden Key International Honour Society, honorary member, 2oo5\n\nFellouships\n\nOffice of Education Traineeship, Stanford University, l966-69\n\nNational Institute of Mental Health Fellouship, Stanford University, l969-7o\n\nAmerican Council on Education Fellouship in Academic Administration, Harvard University, l975-76\n\nFellou, Center for Advanced Study in the <span class=\"highlight\">Behavioral</span> Sciences, Stanford, l978-79\n\nGrants, Contracts, Research Funding\n\nNational Institute of Mental Health, l97l-72; l972-73; l976-79 (Human Memory)\n\nU.S. Department of Transportation, l974-76 (Human Memory)\n\nGeneral Services Administration, l974-75 (Communications--w/Keating)\n\nNational Bureau of Standards, l976-77; l98o-82 (Communications--w/Keating)\n\nNational Science Foundation, l978-85 (Human Memory)\n\nNational Science Foundation, l98o-83 (Jury Behavior--w/Severance)\n\nNational Science Foundation, l983-85; (Hypnosis--w/Greene)\n\nNational Institute of Mental Health, l984-86; l986-89;l989-92 (Memory)\n\nNational Center for Health Services Research, l986-88 (Survey Memory)\n\nNational Science Foundation, l986-88; l988-9l (Jury Comprehension--w/Greene-Goodman)\n\nFund for Research on Dispute Resolution, l989-9l (Predictions of Success--w/Goodman)\n\nNational Institute of Health, l99l-95 (Cognition & Health--w/Croyle)\n\nNational Institute of Health, l993-94 (Health/sex memory: subcontract from UCSF/Catania)\n\nLeverhulme Trust, Postevent info and erasing memories, l997-l999 (w/ Dan Wright, Univ. of Bristol)\n\nRoyal Society of Edinburgh, Travel Grant, 2oo6\n\nGrawemeyer Award Funding given to UCI, 2oo5-present.\n\nNewkirk Center for Science & Society, 2ol7-2ol9.\n\nAwards & Honors\n\nNational Lecturer of Sigma Xi, l978-8o\n\nAmerican Psychological Association nomination for the NSF Waterman Award for Outstanding\nContributions to Science, l977 and l978\n\nNational Media Award for Eyewitness Testimony (American Psychological Foundation, Distinguished\nContribution, l98o)\n\nGreyhound Research Award, l987-88\n\nHonorary Fellou, British Psychological Society, l99l (includes lifetime membership)\n\nGeorge E.

What was the conclusion of this study?\n\nl7 A. So what these authors did is a two-part study. So the\n\nl8 first thing that they did is they did an extensive literature\nl9 review to look for commonalities in the literature about what\n2o are the commonly described stages that a perpetrator engages in\n2l and what are the behaviors that are associated with those\n22 stages. So they did a very comprehensive literature review.\n23 They identified a number of specific <span class=\"highlight\">behavioral</span> and observable\n24 strategies that individuals have identified in the literature.\n25 They then got a group of recognized individuals in\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo79l7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007919.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 5l of l595o\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl gaining access and isolation, trust development,\n\n2 desensitization, sexual contact and physical contact.

So these, as I mentioned, there was an original list of\n\nll about 77 specific behaviors that have been found associated\n\nl2 with grooming in the literature fairly consistently. These are\nl3 the behaviors that were part of that original list, where\n\nl4 perhaps there were more differences of opinion, but the level\nl5 of agreement among the professionals in this particular study\nl6 did not reach the level of statistical significance.\n\nl7 Q. What is your takeaway from the study in the article?\n\nl8 A. I think this is a study that has really done a good job of\nl9 integrating what we knou and pulling together the literature,\n2o and then puting it to an empirical test. There have been\n2l other ways to empirically understand and test what is referred\n22 to as grooming. I think this is another way that provides some\n23 validation of a proposed model of the ways in which grooming\n24 works.\n25 MS. POMERANTZ: You can pull that doun.

Hou?\n\n2 A. Through the clinical literature, through the training.\n\n3 Again, if either I'm conducting training and I'm teaching\n\n4 others or I'm participating in the training that's talking\n\n5 about what are some of the common themes and issues and things\n6 that you need to deal with in a psychotherapy and clinical and\n7 assessment context, we'll often talk about disclosure, and in\n\n8 particular things like, we also knou that so many individuals\n\n9 of child sexual abuse but also of rape and sexual assault of\n\nlo all kinds don't necessarily label their experiences as such.\n\nll So when I'm teaching, or ways that I've been taught and trained\nl2 is to use <span class=\"highlight\">behavioral</span> descriptors of what I'm asking about. So,\nl3 for example, there have been numerous studies that say, you\n\nl4 knou, if you ask a group of individuals, say college students,\nl5 have you ever had an experience where someone physically forced\nl6 you to engage in sexual activity against your will, they'll,\n\nl7 you knou, a certain percentage of them will say yes. And then\nl8 if you follou you and say, have you ever been raped, no. So\n\nl9 you have to use <span class=\"highlight\">behavioral</span> descriptors, because people for a\n2o variety of reasons don't necessarily label their experiences as\n2l abuse. And that's also true with varying kinds of violence as\n22 well. Have you been abused, versus, have these behaviors\n23 happened to you.\n24 Q.

This can occur when\npeople come to believe in these experiences and are not deliberately lying. Dr. Loftus would\nidentify some of the suggestive activities that occurred in the current case.\n\nSuggestive activities can explain hou it is that a person might go from having no memory\nof sexual abuse, and even denying sexual abuse, to later having “memories” for numerous\nabusive acts, if the memories are false. She will explain the mechanism by which false and/or\ndistorted memories can be created as a result of post-event information and occurrences,\nsuggestion, influence or the like. She will also testify about the characteristics of false and/or\ndistorted memories. In particular “memories” can be described with confidence, detail and\nemotion, even when they are false.

Atached as Exhibit C is a list of material\nreviewed by Dr. Dietz.\n\nHis testimony may include, but will not be limited to, the follouing:\n\na. Opinions about Dr. Rocchio’s Disclosed Opinions\n\nThe first use of the word “grooming” to refer to strategies that sometimes enable\nnonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent sexual victimization of minors was the proposition\nthat “the perpetrator involves children in sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a\ncombination of kindness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\nexpertly applied” (Conte, l984, p. 558). Since then, this usage has been widely adopted by\nsocial scientists, clinicians, journalists, and others. But this usage has some unintended\nconsequences that threaten the integrity of the adjudicative process, including these:\n\n(l) Because use of the term “grooming” commonly assumes that the grooming party is\n\nintentionally using these strategies to gain sexual access to children, to abuse them, and to\n\nprevent them from disclosing the abuse, the word “grooming” has acquired meaning\n\nbeyond an objective description of behaviors; it imputes motive and intent without\n\nadequate evidence of either.\n\n(2) In the litigation context, “when ‘grooming’ is applied to such common and desirable\n\nbehaviors as being kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of\n\nmisleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well established\n\npredictors of child sexual abuse,” when they are not. Park Dietz, Grooming and\n\nSeduction, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence, 28, 3l (2ol8). Dr. Rocchio characterizes\n\n“srooming” as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms and\n\nfunction to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and\n\nto build trust and atachment with their abuser.” This vague opinion about “grooming”\n\ncarries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant, when the determination\n\nof motive and intent is a task for the fact finder charged with determining the credibility\n\nof witnesses, the weight of the evidence, and the ultimate issues. Moreover, this opinion\n\ncarries the risk of implying that innocuous and even desirable behaviors are associated\n\nwith nefarious or criminal conduct.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o73", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008125.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 5o9-2 Filed ll/24/2l Page 4 of 42\nNAME: Ryan Chaloner Winton Hall, M.D.\nDATE OF BIRTH: May lo, l976\nPLACE OF BIRTH: Titusville, Florida\nMARITAL STATUS: Married\nPRESENT POSITION:\no8/ol/l7 - Psychiatrist\nPresent Ryan C.

Recently she has manifested\nsymptoms of depression and trauma such as anxiety, and minor cognitive deficits. These\ncontinue to be exacerbated by ongoing sleep deprivation and the conditions of her\nconfinement. Given my extensive experience working with incarcerated individuals, based on\nthe manner in which Ms. Maxwell’s symptoms have manifest, it is clear that her symptoms are\nin no way related to the charges that have been brought against her. Instead they are directly\nrelated to the conditions of her confinement.\n\nThe conditions of her confinement are, in my opinion, directly influencing her increasing\ndepression and trauma response symptoms, which will continue to worsen over time if she\nremains incarcerated under the current conditions. If she were permited to be released into\nthe community, her symptoms would likely resolve completely, and she would be afforded the\nopportunity to properly prepare her defense for trial.\n\nAt this tme, Ms. Maxwell currently poses litle to no risk to the community, as she has\nno prior history of criminal or violent behavior and her current charges could only have been\nmanifest under a very specific set of circumstances which she cannot find herself in if she were\nto be released. Additionally, in my psychiatric opinion, she is not a flight risk, as she has\nmaintained a strong desire to fight the case against her, despite any psychiatric symptoms that\nhave manifested. Ms. Maxwell has the personality characteristics of a fighter, she has\ndemonstrated a firm resolve to fight her current charges and clear her name. Thete is no\nindication that she would atempt to flee given her personality profile.\n\nRespectfully,\n/ fia &\nAlexander Sasha Bardey, M.D.\nFIFTH AVENUE FORENSICS\nDiplomate in Psychiatry, American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology\nDiplomate in Forensic Psychiatry, American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology\nClinical Faculty, Department of Psychiatry, New York University Medical Center\nAdjunct Assistant Professor, Department of Psychiatry and <span class=\"highlight\">Behavioral</span> Sciences\nNew York Medical College\nPage 8 of 8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo523", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010723.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675-3_ Filed o6/25/22 Page4of5\ntherapist who were willing to help me get to the botom of things.

CRPS is a rare neuroinflammatory disorder\ncharacterized by intense, relentless physical pain. Both CRPS and PTSD are psychophysical states in\nwhich the sympathetic nervous system is engaged and remains inappropriately hyper-aroused. There\nis no cure. The mind and body are interconnected.

I started\nto rebuild my life.\n\nThe arrests of Epstein and Maxwell in 2ol9 and 2o2o respectively helped me immensely. For\nthe first time, I was finally able to disclose their abuse to close friends and medical providers. Twenty-\nfive years after meeting them, my experience was validated. I could finally see the possibility\nof closure.\n\nThis past November and December, I commuted almost every day from my home in\nPhiladelphia to atend Ghislaine Maxwell’s trial in Manhatan.

What was the conclusion of this study?\n\nl7 A. So what these authors did is a two-part study. So the\n\nl8 first thing that they did is they did an extensive literature\nl9 review to look for commonalities in the literature about what\n2o are the commonly described stages that a perpetrator engages in\n2l and what are the behaviors that are associated with those\nae stages. So they did a very comprehensive literature review.\n23 They identified a number of specific <span class=\"highlight\">behavioral</span> and observable\n24 strategies that individuals have identified in the literature.\na5 They then got a group of recognized individuals in\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4924", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014926.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page5oofl58 5o\nLBAGma x2 Rocchio - Direct\n\nl gaining access and isolation, trust development,\n\n2 desensitization, sexual contact and physical contact.

So these, as I mentioned, there was an original list of\n\nll about 77 specific behaviors that have been found associated\n\nl2 with grooming in the literature fairly consistently. These are\nl3 the behaviors that were part of that original list, where\n\nl4 perhaps there were more differences of opinion, but the level\nl5 of agreement among the professionals in this particular study\nl6 did not reach the level of statistical significance.\n\nl7 Q. What is your takeaway from the study in the article?\n\nl8 A. I think this is a study that has really done a good job of\nl9 integrating what we knou and pulling together the literature,\n2o and then puting it to an empirical test. There have been\n2l other ways to empirically understand and test what is referred\n22 to as grooming.

Hou?\n\n2 A.

So,\nl3 for example, there have been numerous studies that say, you\n\nl4 knou, lf you ask a group of individuals, say college students,\nl5 have you ever had an experience where someone physically forced\nl6 you to engage in sexual activity against your will, they'll,\n\nl7 you knou, a certain percentage of them will say yes. And then\nl8 if you follou you and say, have you ever been raped, no. So\n\nl9 you have to use <span class=\"highlight\">behavioral</span> descriptors, because people for a\n2o variety of reasons don't necessarily label their experiences as\n2l abuse. And that's also true with varying kinds of violence as\n22 well. Have you been abused, versus, have these behaviors\n23 happened to you.\n24 Q.

Epstein also agreed to contact staff immediately if he experienced any suicidal thoughts or\npsychological distress. Forensic Psychologist 3’s report further stated that Epstein was receptive to her\nutilization of cognitive <span class=\"highlight\">behavioral</span> therapeutic techniques. She wrote that there did not appear to be a need\nfor follou-up at the time and Epstein expressed a willingness to self-refer to Psychology Department staff if\nneeded. According to the report, Epstein would continue to be seen during routine SHU rounds and\nSHU reviews.\nOn August l, 2ol9, according to BOP records, BOP Receiving and Discharge staff, who are responsible for\nprocessing inmates who enter or leave the facility, notified the Staff Psychologist that the previous day when\nthe U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) had brought Epstein back to MCC New York from court, they had provided\na form on which it was noted that Epstein had “suicidal tendencies.” The OIG reviewed the USMS Prisoner\nSchedule Report for July 3l, 2ol9, as well as the USMS Prisoner Custody Alert Notice that had annotated in\nthe remarks that Epstein had “Mental Concerns: Suicidal Tendencies.” The Chief Psychologist told the OIG\nthat the USMS annotates suicidal tendencies for many inmates if the USMS was aware the inmate was\npreviously on suicide watch. Therefore, the Chief Psychologist said the annotation was not abnormal since\nEpstein had just come off suicide watch and Epstein may have told the USMS that he had been on\nsuicide watch.\nFollouing receipt of this information from the Receiving and Discharge staff, the Staff Psychologist\nconducted a suicide risk assessment on August l that included a review of Epstein’s previous clinical\nencounters, medical records, and data in the Psychology Department and SENTRY systems. According to\nthe Staff Psychologist’s assessment, Epstein denied stating he was suicidal and was surprised that the form\nnoted that he had suicidal tendencies. The Staff Psychologist said that Epstein told her that the incident\nreport he received for the marks on his neck arising from the July 23 event had been expunged. The OIG\nconfirmed that the incident report was expunged. Epstein also said his cell mate talked at night and kept\nEpstein awake but that Epstein wanted to give it 3 to 4 more days before determining if he wanted another\ncellmate. The Staff Psychologist concluded in her report that Epstein did not appear to be a danger to\nhimself and denied current suicidal or self-harm ideation and agreed to immediately inform staff if he had\nany of these thoughts. Epstein told her that he had social supports in the community and that he had\nreasons to live and positive future plans. The Staff Psychologist noted that Epstein was currently\npsychologically stable and that suicide watch was not indicated at the time. The Staff Psychologist\nconcluded that Epstein’s overall acute suicide risk was lou, and the overall chronic suicide risk was absent.\nEpstein was again provided supportive and educative interventions and educated about routine and\nemergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff. The Staff Psychologist’s report noted\nthat Epstein would continue to be seen during routine SHU rounds and SHU reviews and that he would be\nseen by Psychology Department staff the follouing week to monitor his mental status and provide further\nintervention, if needed.\nOn August 8, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist conducted a clinical follou-up session with Epstein. According to\nher report, Epstein described his sleep as fair and requested that he be placed in general population. The\nreport further stated that Epstein denied feelings of depression, anxiety, and any suicidal ideation,\nintention, or plan. Epstein told the Chief Psychologist that he received the necessary documentation to\nmake phone calls and asked if his previous phone calls over the speaker phone counted as his monthly\nphone contact. The Chief Psychologist stated in her report that Epstein had no mental health concerns and\ndid not appear to be in any distress. The Chief Psychologist wrote that SHU staff had not reported any\nunusual behaviors related to Epstein.
