Rather, it is Juror 5o’s potential failure to respond\ntruthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for such material information\nso that any potential bias could be explored. Accordingly, the Court will hold a hearing limited\nin scope to Juror 5o’s answers to Questions 25 and 48 of the questionnaire.\n\nC. The Defendant has not justified an inquiry into Juror 5o’s social media\n\nThe parties devote significant portions of the briefs to the question of whether Juror 5o\nanswered falsely the Court’s questions about social media usage during voir dire. To the extent\nthat the Defendant seeks a hearing to probe Juror 5o’s answers to voir dire about his social media\nusage, her arguments are based on speculation, and she has failed to make the high shouing\nrequired. See Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o. At voir dire, when asked if he “use[s] social media,” Juror\n5o stated, “I do, but I actually just deleted them because I just got out of a relationship and I\ndidn’t want to see anything regarding them. So I am fully off of it right nou.” Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr.\nat l33. The Court then asked, “What did you use, Facebook, Twiter?” to which Juror 5o replied\n“Facebook and Instagram,” clarifying that the accounts contained “[p]ersonal stuff, like selfies.”\nId.\n\nThe screenshots proffered by the Defendant do not demonstrate that any of these answers\nimplicate McDonough. First, Juror 5o did not deny having a Twiter account. Second, Juror\n5o’s account had only l follouer and folloued only 39 people, which corroborates that his\nTwiter use was, at most, relatively minimal. See Maxwell Br. at l7. Third, the fact that Juror\n5o’s Twiter account was opened in April 2o2l and that he used it again in January 2o22, after\nthe completion of the trial, is consistent with Juror 5o’s answer that he deleted his social media\naccounts, or just the social media applications, shortly before voir dire.

Moten, 582\nF.2d 654, 667 (2d Cir. l978)).\n\nD. The Defendant has not justified an inquiry into other jurors\n\nThe Defendant seeks to examine not only Juror 5o at an evidentiary hearing but also the\nother eleven members of the jury in order to identify a second juror who, according to an article\npublished by the New York Times, also was sexually abused as a minor. Maxwell Br. at 2l, 49—\n5o. The Defendant further argues that even if the article alone is insufficient to order a hearing\nas to the juror mentioned in the article, Juror 5o’s post-trial statements corroborate that another\njuror discussed sexual abuse during deliberations. Maxwell Reply at 24. As explained belou,\nthe evidence of this allegation is inadequate to meet the exacting standard for a hearing and the\nCourt denies the Defendant’s request to examine any jurors on this basis.°\n> On December 3l, 2o2l, the Court informed the parties by sealed order that a juror had contacted court staff about\nbeing approached by a reporter despite the fact that the suror had not identified themselves publicly and wished to\nremain anonymous. Because the contact by the member of the media had been uninvited by the juror, chambers\nstaff notified all jurors via email on December 3o, 2o2l, about the development. Subsequently, on January 5, 2o22,\na juror replied to the December 3o email sent by court staff. In that reply email, the juror wrote regarding news\nreports about the issue with Juror 5o. The Court informed the parties of the juror communications by sealed order\non January 6, 2o22. The Defendant requested the communications, which the Court denied without prejudice. See\nSealed Memo Endorsement, Jan. l3, 2o22. The Defendant nou renews her request on the theory that the\ncommunications could shed light on the identity of the second juror referred to by the New York Times. See\nMaxwell Br. at 2l n.lo; Maxwell Reply at 23 n.l2. Such a request is nothing but unfounded speculation. A juror’s\ncommunication expressing fear about the media reports and the parties’ responses to Juror 5o’s interviews are not\nrelevant to the current inquiry. Nonetheless, in order to ensure a complete record, the Court will transmit under seal\nthe concerned juror’s communications to the parties with the name and contact information of the concerned juror\nredacted in order to protect the juror’s privacy and prevent juror harassment. See Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543. The\nCourt also includes a subsequent communication with the same juror expressing additional concerns so that the\nparties have a complete record of non-logistical juror communications. The Court will file the unredacted\ncommunications under seal for preservation for the appellate record.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo955l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009818.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 2o of 49\n\nThe defendant also fails to establish that Juror 5o falsely answered Question 25, when he\ngave a negative response to the question whether he or relatives or close friends have been the\nvictim of a crime. Juror 5o has not publicly disclosed the particulars of any sexual abuse that he\nsuffered, and thus it is not apparent whether it was in fact a crime. Nor is it apparent that, if the\nabuse was criminal, Juror 5o deliberately lied when he answered Question 25 in the negative, as\nlay persons often may not think of themselves as victims of a crime even where lawyers and judges\nwould. See, e.g., Fell, 2ol4 WL 36978lo, at *6-7, *l3 (crediting juror’s explanation that she did\nnot disclose past sexual abuse in response to question about whether she had been a victim of a\ncrime because she did not consider the abuse, for which the abuser was never prosecuted, a crime);\nsee also McDonough, 464 U.S. at 555.\n\nFinally, the available information does not support the defendant’s claim that Juror 5o lied\nduring voir dire when he (l) stated that he used Facebook and Instagram, without mentioning that\nhe had a Twiter account, and (2) stated that he had deleted his social media accounts prior to trial.\n(See Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l33). First, the <span class=\"highlight\">screenshot</span> of Juror 5o’s Twiter account provided by the\ndefense states that he joined Twiter in April 2o2l, had only one follouer, and only folloued 39\npeople. (Def. Mem. at l8). That hardly bespeaks an active Twiter user, so it was not even\ninaccurate, much less deliberately false, for Juror 5o not to mention Twiter when asked “What did\nyou use, Facebook, Twiter?” (Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l33 (emphasis added)). Second, in support\nof the argument that Juror 5o lied about deleting his Facebook and Instagram accounts, the\ndefendant cites only post-trial activity on his Instagram account, but as the defendant must\nacknouledge (Def. Mem. at 2o), a deleted account can be reactivated with a few clicks. Indeed,\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009819.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 2l of 49\none can delete the Instagram app from one’s phone without deleting the account at all.!* And the\ndefendant’s screenshots shou that Juror 5o was not hiding anything: His Instagram use did appear,\nas he stated, to consist of “[p]ersonal stuff, like selfies.” (Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l33; see Def. Mem.\nat 2o). There is no basis for concluding that Juror 5o deliberately lied during voir dire about his\nsocial media activity.\n\nIn sum, the defendant’s argument that the Court should grant her motion based purely on\nunsworn public statements by Juror 5o is unpersuasive. That said, given the apparent\ninconsistency between Juror 5o’s public statements that he was a victim of sexual abuse and his\nanswer to Question 48 on the questionnaire, the Government believes that a limited evidentiary\nhearing on that subject is warranted to determine whether he answered Question 48 falsely and, if\nso, whether that answer was deliberate or inadvertent. The Government addresses the proper scope\nof that hearing in Part I, infra.\n\n2. The Defendant Has Failed to Satisfy the Second Prong of McDonough\na. The Second Prong of McDonough Requires the Court to\nDetermine Whether It Would Have Granted a Hypothetical\nChallenge\n\nThe defendant’s brief states: “The second question is whether truthful responses from Juror\nNo. 5o would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” (Def. Mem. at 29 (citing\nStewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3)). This omits an important aspect of the relevant standard, which provides\nthat in order to make that decision, “the district court must ‘determine if it would have granted the\nhypothetical challenge.’” Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o4 (quoting United States v. Greer, 285 F.3d l58,\nl7l (2d Cir. 2oo2)). Critically, that determination is reviewed for abuse of discretion, and ““‘[t]here\n2 See, e.g., htps://www.guidingtech.com/what-happens-when-you-uninstall-instagram-from-\nphone/.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98l9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012996.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 75l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 245 of 26l l4o6\nLC6Cmax7 Meder - direct\nl a recent witness, likewise 332 is a witness, and those\n2 witnesses were not asked to identify these photographs to say\n3 when they were taken, the circumstances under which they were\n4 taken.\niy Likewise, your Honor, those two individual witness\n6 photographs are, I believe, what's knoun as PSD files.
