Accordingly, any danger that Mr. Epstein may have once posed to the\ncommunity has long since abated. At the very least, this enormous gap in time precludes a\nfinding by clear and convincing evidence that no conditions of release can reasonably assure the\ncommunity’s safety.°\nThe rebutable presumption of a risk of flight is negated by the evidence that the\n\ngovernment had stated it believed it could prosecute Mr. Epstein for the very same conduct for\nwhich he was immunized, albeit in a second jurisdiction, despite the protections conferred upon\nhim under the NPA. Mr. Epstein’s continuous presence in the United States even while he had a\nresidence out of the country reinforces the point. As detailed belou, Mr. Epstein understood the\nNPA as a global resolution of any charges arising from the alleged conduct at issue here,\nincluding conduct in New York. Indeed, the government, in a Southern District of Florida filing\n® The government vastly overreaches in painting Mr. Epstein as dangerous based on musty plea\ndiscussions. The government’s argument that Mr. Epstein’s release would risk obstructive\nbehavior, at pages 8-9 of its submission, rests primarily upon statements made between Mr.\nEpstein’s prior counsel and an <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> U.S. Atorney while they searched for a federal offense,\nat the government’s behest, with a one-year statutory maximum or guideline during the give-and-\ntake of those of plea negotiations. The communication from prior counsel about a potential\nproffer for a federal charge was met with the response that there was no sufficient evidence to\ncharge such an offense. These purported facts were mere allegations that did not ultimately\nmanifest themselves in any agreement by Mr. Epstein — nor in any agreement that probable cause\nexisted to support any obstruction or assault charge. And the documents from the Southern\nDistrict of Florida litigation referenced by the government in support of its argument on this\npoint expressly acknouledge this lack of substantiation. See Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2 v.\nUnited States, o8-CV-8o736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkt. 36l-lo (prosecutor stating, “[o]n the obstruction\ncharges, many of the facts that I included in that first proffer were hypothesized based upon our\ndiscussions and the agents’ observations of [redacted]. We will need to interview her to confirm\nthe accuracy of those facts. . . .”), Dkt. 36l-ll (prosecutor stating, “I knou that someone\nmentioned there being activity on an airplane, I just wanted to make sure that there is factual\nbasis for the plea that the agents can confirm”), Dkt. 36l-9 (prosecutor stating, “I don’t knou the\nfactual basis for the alleged [redacted] because we have no independent evidence of that’). In\nshort, these were suggested hypotheses not facts, and the government itself ultimately did not\nbelieve there was factual support for the allegations. They do not provide a sufficiently reliable\nfactual basis for any finding by clear and convincing evidence. As to the suggestion by the\nprosecutor that a charge could be predicated on a prior incident where it was alleged that an\ninvestigator forced a family member of a witness off the road, the defense is without knouledge\nas to the basis for this allegation and the conduct, if it occurred, was not atributable to or\nauthorized by Mr. Epstein.\n\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo279\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000297.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6-l Filed o7/ll/l9 Page8ofl5\nCase 9:o8-cv-8o736-KAM Document 36l-62 Entered on FLSD Docket o2/lo/2ol6 Page 8 of |\n- | l5 |\n|\n|\nBy signing this agreement, Epstein asserts and certifies that the above has been read\nand explained to him.

Far from being “musty,” Release\nMotion at 6 n.6, the defendant’s past behavior in connection with being investigated for sexually\nabusing children is the best predictor of his likely incentives and activities in connection with being\ncharged with sexually abusing children. For example, in the incident the defendant nou claims\nwas not atributable to or authorized by him, the contemporaneous police report indicates that\npressure tactics were at the very least coordinated closely with individuals in the defendant’s orbit.\nSee Palm Beach Police Report (the “Police Report’) (Ex. B). According to the Police Report, the\nparent of one of the defendant’s victims was driven off the road by a private investigator. The\nPolice Report provides further information regarding victim and witness threats and intimidation\nreported against an individual who was directly in contact with an <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span> of the defendant,\nfolloued “immediately” by a call to that same individual from a phone number associated with the\ndefendant’s businesses and associates.\n\nSeparately, and in addition, there are also extensive allegations of obstruction and\ntampering in connection with civil lawsuits brought against the defendant follouing his 2oo8\nconviction. See Doe v. United States, o8 Civ. 8o736 (S.D.

Specifically, one victim reported that “she was\npersonally contacted through a source that has maintained contact with Epstein,” who “assured\n[the victim] that she would receive monetary compensation for her assistance in not cooperating\nwith law enforcement.” Indeed, the victim reported having been told: “Those who help him will\nbe compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with.”’ See Palm Beach Police Report\n(Ex. C).\n\nAnd Epstein’s efforts to influence witnesses continue to this day. As in the past, within\nrecent months. he paid significant amounts of money to influence individuals who were close to\nhim during the time period charged in this case and who might be witnesses against him at a trial.\nBy way of background, on or about November 28, 2ol8, the Miami Herald began publishing a\nseries of articles relating to the defendant, his conduct, and the circumstances of his prior\nconviction and the non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”). Records obtained by the Government\nfrom Institution-l appear to shou that just two days later, on or about November 3o, 2ol8, the\ndefendant wired $loo,ooo from a trust account he controlled to an individual named as a possible\nco-conspirator in the NPA. The same records appear to shou that just three days after that, on or\nabout December 3, 2ol8, the defendant wired $25o,ooo from the same trust account to another\nindividual named as a possible co-conspirator in the NPA and also identified as one of the\ndefendant’s employees in the Indictment. Neither of these payments appears to be recurring or\nrepeating during the approximately five years of bank records presently available to the\nGovernment. This course of action, and in particular its timing, suggests the defendant was\natempting to further influence co-conspirators who might provide information against him in light\nof the recently re-emerging allegations\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo339\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000342.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll Filed o7/l2/l9 Page l4 of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage l4\nSecond, he is also wrong on the law. Courts have found that Section l59l applied to both\nsuppliers and consumers of commercial sex acts. See, e.g., United States v. Jungers, 7o2 F.3d\nlo66, lo69 (8th Cir. 2ol3) (upholding the conviction of a defendant who atempted to pay for oral\nsex from an underage girl and explaining: “The sole issue raised on appeal is whether ‘[t]he plain\nand unambiguous provisions of l8 U.S.C. § l59l apply to both suppliers and consumers of\ncommercial sex acts.” We conclude they do.”) (alteration in original). The lone case cited by the\ndefendant, Fierro v. Taylor, No. ll Civ. 8573, 2ol2 WL l3o4263o (S.D.N.Y. July 2, 2ol2), relied\nheavily on the statutory interpretation undertaken by two district courts in the District of South\nDakota, United States v. Bonestroo, No. ll Cr. 4ool6, 2ol2 WL l37o4 (D.S.D. Jan. 4, 2ol2), and\nUnited States v. Jungers, ll Cr. 4ool8, 2oll WL 6o46495 (D.S.D. Dec. 5, 2oll), both of which\nwere explicitly overruled by the Eighth Circuit decision in Jungers, 7o2 F.3d lo66. In the seven\nyears since Fierro has been decided, it does not appear to have been cited by a single other court.\nAdditionally, other cases in this Circuit and elsewhere have upheld convictions of procurers or\ncustomers. See United States v. O’Connor, 65o F.3d 839 (2d Cir. 2oll) (upholding convictions\nunder Section l59l of both the buyer and seller of a child); United States v. Cook, 782 F.3d 983\n(8th Cir. 2ol5) (rejecting a constitutional challenge that Section l59l would be void for vagueness\nif applied to purchasers); United States v. Mikoloyck, No. o9 Cr. o36, 2oo9 WL 47989oo (W.D.\nMo. Dec. 7, 2oo9) (“contrary to defendant’s argument, l8 U.S.C. § l59l clearly applies to those\nwho atempt to purchase underage sex, not merely the pimps of actual exploited children”) (citing\nUnited States v. Roberts, l74 F. App’s 475 (llth Cir. 2oo6) (in which defendant was convicted\nunder sections l59l(a) and l594(a) even though no actual children were involved)).\nCONCLUSION\nAs set forth above, the defendant’s proposed bail package is insufficient and insubstantial.\nPretrial Services, victims, and the Government all recommend pretrial detention due to the unusual\nand concerning confluence of factors in this case, including the defendant’s extraordinary wealth,\ndemonstrated willingness to interfere with victims and witnesses, continued possession of lewd\nphotographs of young females, and both the incentive and means to flee prosecution.\nVery truly yours,\nGEOFHREY S.

The\ndefendant is extremely wealthy, has extensive foreign contacts, and is charged with serious\noffenses that carry a potential statutory sentence of up to 45 years’ imprisonment—even a fraction\nof which could result in the defendant, who is 66 years old, spending the rest of his life in jail. In\nsum, the defendant’s transient lifestyle, his lack of family or community ties, his extensive\ninternational travel and ties outside the country, and his vast wealth, including his access to and\nounership of private planes, all provide the defendant with the motive and means to become a\nsuccessful fugitive. Further, the nature of the offenses he is alleged to have perpetrated—the abuse\ndozens of underage, vulnerable girls—along with his demonstrated willingness to harass,\nintimidate and otherwise tamper with victims and other potential witnesses against him, render his\ndangerousness readily apparent.\nAccordingly, the Government respectfully submits that the defendant cannot and will not\nbe able to meet his burden of overcoming the strong presumption in favor of detention, that there\nare no conditions of bail that would assure the defendant’s presence in court proceedings in this\ncase or protect the safety of the community, and that any application for bail should be denied.\nVery truly yours,\nGEOFHREY S.

Cash and Diamonds\nAt the Detention Hearing, the Government informed the Court that diamonds and cash\nwere seized from a safe in the defendant’s Manhatan residence. The Court inquired as to the value\nof these items. After conferring with law enforcement agents who have reviewed the materials\nfrom the safe, the Government has learned that the safe contained more than $7o,ooo in cash. In\naddition, the safe contained 48 loose diamond stones, ranging in size from approximately l carat\nto 2.38 carats, as well as a large diamond ring. The Government is currently unaware of whether\nthe defendant maintains similar stashes of cash and/or jewels at his multiple properties, or in other\nlocations. Such ready cash and loose diamonds are consistent with the capability to leave the\njurisdiction at a moment’s notice.\nV. Conclusion\nFor the reasons set forth herein, in the Government’s July 8, 2ol9 and July l2, 2ol9\ndetention memoranda, and on the record at the Detention Hearing, the Court should order that the\ndefendant be detained pending trial.

A. The Court requested from the Defense all application materials that Mr. Epstein may |\nhave submited to the New Mexico Department of Public Safety, believing that the Department |\nwould not initiate the waiver of Mr. Epstein’s sex offense registration on its oun. No such |\nmaterials have been received by the Court as of this date.\nThe Court understands that Mr. Epstein is also registered as a sex offender in the Virgin\nIslands (Level I) and in Florida (Level J). It has received no materials from the Defense\nregarding sex offender applications or proceedings in those two jurisdictions.\nIn sum, based upon all of the proffers and evidence set forth at pp. lo-2l above, the Court\nfinds by clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Epstein poses a danger to other persons and to\nthe community.\nG. Mr. Epstein Also Poses A Risk Of Flight\nIn the section that follous, the Court considers “risk of flight” even though it has already\ndetermined that Mr. Epstein presents a danger to the community. “[A] finding of either danger :\n| to the community or risk of flight will be sufficient to detain the defendant pending trial.” |\n2l\n|\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo492\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000505.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document32-lI-~ Filed o7/l8/l9” Page I of 47\nCase 9:o8-cv-8o736-KAM Document 36l-ll Entered on FLSD Docket o2/lo/2ol6 Page 2 of 3\nVillafana, Ann Marie C.

It is not accessible on-line via PACER, but someone can go to the\nClerk’s Office to obtain a copy.\nA non-prosecution agreement would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would remain part of our\ncase file. It probably would be subject to a FOIA request, but it is not something that we would distribute\nwithout compulsory process.\nOn the obstruction charges, many of the facts I included in that first proffer were hypothesized based upon our |\ndiscussions and the agents’ observations of EE: = We will need to interview her to confirm the accuracy of |\nthose facts. On a second count, we could rely on the incident where Mr, Epstein’s private investigators\nfolloued MMM father, forcing him off the road.

The defendant will not, houever, be permited to meet in person with her\nlawyers until she tests out of quarantine.\n\nAfter the defendant tests out of quarantine, she will resume the same schedule that the\nMDC implemented approximately three months ago. Specifically, from 7am to 8pm every day,\nthe defendant will be permited out of her isolation cell. During those thirteen hours, the defendant\nwill have access to a computer on which to review her discovery outside of her cell. Also during\nthe day, the defendant will be permited to, among other things, make legal calls, make personal\ncalls, access CorrLinks, and shouer. From 8pm to 7am, the defendant will remain in her isolation\ncell.

On days when the defendant does not have in-person\nlegal visits, she will have access to legal calls for up to three hours per day.\n\nAs was the case three months ago, the defendant continues to have more time to review her\ndiscovery than any other inmate at the MDC, even while in quarantine.

Due to the large number of MDC inmates and the\nvolume of mail received at the MDC, this process can take multiple days. As noted above,\nhouever, the defendant is able to send and receive emails with defense counsel every day and has\nregular communication with counsel via VTC.\n\nMDC staff conduct two pat-doun searches of the defendant per day: once when she is\nmoved from her isolation cell to the day room each morning, and once when returns from the day\nroom to her isolation cell each night. As part of those searches, the defendant is required to remove\nher mask and open her mouth briefly so that MDC staff, who remain masked during the searches,\ncan confirm she has not hidden contraband in her mouth. These pat-doun and mouth searches are\nconsistent with MDC’s policy that all inmates be searched whenever they move to a different\nlocation within the jail facility. Previously, the defendant atended VTC conferences in a separate\npart of the MDC, requiring that she be searched when taken to and from her VTC calls with\ncounsel. Recently, houever, the MDC changed the location of the defendant’s VTC calls so that\nthe defendant does not need to leave her unit in order to atend VTC calls with her counsel, thereby\nreducing the number of searches. During the suspension of visitation, the defendant has not been\nstrip searched. When visitation resumes, the defendant, like all other inmates, will be strip\nsearched after any in-person visit.\n\nIn addition, MDC staff search the defendant’s cell for contraband once per day. MDC staff\nalso conduct a body scan on the defendant once per week to check for any secreted contraband.\nAt night, MDC staff are required to confirm that the defendant is not in distress every fifteen\nminutes. To do so, staff point a flashlight to the ceiling of the defendant’s cell to illuminate the\ncell sufficiently to confirm that the defendant is breathing every fifteen minutes. The MDC\ncontinues to assess that these searches are all necessary for the safety of the institution and the\ndefendant.\n\nShould the Court have any questions or require any additional details regarding this topic,\nthe Government will promptly provide additional information.\n\nRespectfully submited,\nAUDREY STRAUSS\nUnited States Atorney\nMaurene Comey / Alison Moe / Lara Pomerantz\n<span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> United States Atorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nTel: (2l2) 637-2324\nCc: All Counsel of Record (By ECF)\nDOJ-OGR-ooool358\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001364.jpg": "CaSesb:2o-cr/oo8BG+AN Nt B6euMesnt 296 2 Filed/o4/o6/PragPage bar 6\nPage 6\nShould the Court have any questions or require any additional details regarding this topic,\n\nthe Government will promptly provide additional information.\nRespectfully submited,\nAUDREY STRAUSS\nUnited States Atorney\nMaurene Comey / Alison Moe / Lara Pomerantz\n<span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> United States Atorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nTel: (2l2) 637-2324\n\nCc: All Counsel of Record (By ECF)\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool364\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001369.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 5o-2, o4/l5/2o2l, 3o78ll6, Page2 of 2\n5.

The Government and defense counsel were in discussions — as recently as 6 p.m. last\nnight — in the hopes of jointly proposing a protective order. Until seeing the filing on ECF this\nmorning, the Government had understood those discussions to be ongoing.

The defendant\nidentifies no basis for the Court to disturb that determination by the BOP, particularly given that,\nas detailed belou, her housing assignment will not negatively affect her ability to review discovery\nin this case.\n\nRegarding the defendant’s request in connection with access to discovery, the Government\nunderstands from BOP that the defendant had not even yet received her copy of the Government’s\nfirst discovery production at the time the Defense Leter was filed—she received the materials on\nTuesday, August ll. While it is correct that BOP’s initial plan was to provide three hours per day\nof access to the discovery—the same access that is granted to every other pretrial inmate, including\nthose with trial dates scheduled for far earlier than July 2o2l—as of earlier this week, and given\nthe volume of expected discovery, BOP informed the defendant that she will have the opportunity\nto access to her discovery from 7:oo a.m. to 8:oo p.m. every day of the week.

Nathan\n\nOctober 7, 2o2o\n\nPage 6\nAlthough the PBSA is not part of the Prosecution Team, the Government has nevertheless\ncommunicated with the PBSA and requested that the PBSA provide the Prosecution Team with its\nentire investigative file, to the extent it still exists. In response, on September l4, 2o2o, the PBSA\nprovided the Prosecution Team with an electronic copy of its entire case file regarding the Florida\nInvestigation, which consists of 4,42l pages of documents, 43 audio files, and 6 video files. The\nGovernment is reviewing that file for any material that is non-duplicative of other material\npreviously obtained and that warrants disclosure in this case.\n\nThird, the FBI Florida Office conducted a prior federal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein\nbetween approximately 2oo6 and 2olo. As noted above, the electronic files from the FBI Florida\nOffice are accessible by the FBI New York Office, which has provided the Government with a\ncomplete set of FBI electronic files from both its Florida Office and its New York Office for this\ncase. The Government has reviewed those files for discoverable materials. The physical files\nfrom the FBI Florida Office, which are contained in approximately 24 boxes, have all been\ntransferred to the FBI New York Office and are in the possession of the Prosecution Team. Those\nfiles have been scanned and put into an electronic review platform. The Government has\npreviously reviewed those files and is continuing to do so for discoverable materials. In addition,\nand as noted above, some items from the FBI Florida Office file have already been produced as\npart of prior discovery productions in this case.\n\nFourth, the USAO-SDFL participated in the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein\nbetween approximately 2oo6 and 2olo. Before today, the Prosecution Team had never received\nany documents from the USAO-SDFL and did not have the USAO-SDFL’s investigative file.\nIndeed, aside from notifying the SDFL at an executive level that the SDNY was opening its oun\nEpstein investigation in 2ol8, the Prosecution Team had no substantive communications with the\nUSAO-SDFL about the Prosecution Team’s investigation or prosecution until after indicting this\ncase. Houever, after the initiation of this prosecution, the Government communicated with the\nUSAO-SDFL and requested that the USAO-SDFL provide the Prosecution Team with a copy of\nits entire investigative file, so that the Prosecution Team could review the files for material that\nwarrants disclosure in this case. The USAO-SDFL agreed to provide its entire file, which is\ncontained in approximately 28 boxes, to the Prosecution Team. Accordingly, the Government\nhired a vendor to copy the entire USAO-SDFL file and load that file into an electronic review\nplatform. The Government received the electronic copy of the USAO-SDFL file from the vendor\ntoday and intends to review that file for materials that warrant disclosure in this case.\n\nFifth, internal Department of Justice emails relating to the prior Florida Investigation have\nbeen gathered by the Department of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility (“OPR”), as\npart of its unrelated investigation into the resolution of the prior Florida Investigation.* In\nparticular, during the course of its investigation, OPR gathered a significant volume of emails, to\nthe extent they had been preserved and remained accessible, from a number of USAO-SDFL\natorneys, including a number of supervisors in that office and the primary line <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> U.S.\nAtorney who worked on the Florida Investigation (“Atorney-l’).\n> This OPR investigation has been publicly acknouledged by the Department of Justice.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool792\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001793.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 63 Filed lo/o7/2o Page 7 of 8\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nOctober 7, 2o2o\nPage 7\n\nAlthough the Government does not believe it has any obligation to gather or review emails\nsent or received by atorneys at the USAO-SDFL as part of their separate, prior investigation, the\nGovernment nonetheless intends to gather and review the emails sent to or from Atorney-l to the\nextent those emails were preserved and gathered by OPR. As noted, Atorney-l was the primary\nline <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span> on that investigation, and Atorney-l’s emails are thus the most likely to contain\ncommunications with or regarding potential witnesses. The Government has already obtained\nAtorney-l’s emails from OPR, and given the volume, the Government intends to load those emails\ninto an electronic review platform and then conduct targeted searches of those emails for terms\nrelevant to this case, including the defendant’s name and the names of victims and witnesses.\nBased on our understanding of the USAO-SDFL investigation, we do not believe that there are a\nsubstantial number of overlapping victims or witnesses between that investigation and this\nprosecution. But to the extent searches of Atorney-l’s emails reveal non-duplicative Giglio or\n35oo material for any such victims or witnesses, the Government will produce any such identified\nmaterial consistent with any schedule for pre-trial disclosures set by the Court. The Government\ndoes not intend to request or review emails for any other USAO-SDFL or Department of Justice\natorney or otherwise perform a comprehensive review of the internal e-mails of that prosecutor’s\noffice from its wholly separate investigation, including by asking for any other material gathered\nby OPR as part of its investigation.\n\nSixth, beginning in or about 2ol9, atorneys with the United States Atorney’s Office for\nthe Southern District of Georgia (“USAO-SDGA”) were designated to participate in the\nrepresentation of the United States in civil litigation brought by Epstein victims for violations of\nthe Crime Victim Rights Act (“CVRA”) by the USAO-SDFL in connection with the Florida\nInvestigation after the USAO-SDFL was recused from that civil litigation. The Government\nintends to contact the USAO-SDGA and ask whether it (a) had any substantive communications\nwith witnesses relevant to this prosecution during its participation in the CVRA civil litigation, or\n(b) gathered any information regarding the defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell. If so, the Government\nwill request any and all records regarding those topics and will review those records for materials\nthat warrant disclosure in this case. Otherwise, the Government does not intend to request or\nreview any materials from the USAO-SDGA.\n\n%* %* XK\n\nAs noted above, none of these other offices or agencies has played any role in the\ninvestigation or prosecution of this case. In particular, none of these offices and agencies has\nparticipated in witness interviews or taken any other investigative steps with the Prosecution Team.\nNor did any representative of these other offices or agencies play any role in developing strategy,\nmaking charging decisions, or presenting this case to the grand jury. Accordingly, although the\nGovernment maintains that none of these agencies is part of the Prosecution Team in this case,\ngiven the similarity of the nature of the conduct investigated in this case and the conduct\ninvestigated by those other offices and agencies, the Government is prepared to undertake the\nextensive efforts described above to obtain and review additional material. The Government will\ncontinue to produce any portion of those materials that warrants disclosure in this case, including\nin connection with its production of Giglio and 35oo material.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool793\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001794.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 63 Filed lo/o7/2o Page 8 of 8\nHonorable Alison J.

Moreover, the requirement that any evidence of any victim’s abuse by Jeffrey\nEpstein at any point in time must be immediately disclosed to the defense in this case, even when\nit has no bearing on the charges in the Indictment, risks deterring additional victims from coming\nforward to assist in the Government’s investigation.

The Government has reviewed the proposed redactions to the defense leters\ndated November 25, 2o2o and November 3o, 2o2o.

As\ndemonstrated by the defense’s recent leters, any request for sealing of third party information can\nbe made in writing with narrouly tailored redactions. Based on defense counsel’s proffers\nregarding the potential harms that may come from publicly identifying proposed cosigners, the\nGovernment has no objection to the redaction and sealed filing of any identifying information for\nthose individuals. Given the availability of redacted filings, the Government sees no reason for an\nentire hearing to be conducted without the opportunity for the public or the victims in this case to\nobserve.

The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged\nin illegal sexual activity with girls.! OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors commited\nprofessional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was\nsigned or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.\nl. OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein\nin 2oo5, after the parents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.\nEpstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and\nother United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. Ata July 3l,\n2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if Epstein pled\nguilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration, registered as a\nsexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain monetary\ndamages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications with\nEpstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7. The\n! As used in this Report, including in quoted documents and statements, the word “girls” refers to females who\nwere under the age of l8 at the time of the alleged conduct.

OPR also collected\nand reviewed materials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein. OPR also\nexamined extensive publicly available information, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and\nother court records, and reviewed media reports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books\nrelating to the Epstein case.\n\nIn addition to this extensive documentary review, OPR conducted more than 6o interviews\nof witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI administrative personnel;\ncurrent and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former Department atorneys and senior\nmanagers, including a former Deputy Atorney General and a former <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General\nfor the Criminal Division; and the former State Atorney and former <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney in\ncharge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed several victims and atorneys\nrepresenting victims, and reviewed writen submissions from victims, concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and the FBI.\n\nOPR identified former U.S. Atorney Acosta, three former USAO supervisors, and the\nAUSA as subjects of its investigation based on preliminary information indicating that each of\nthem was involved in the decision to resolve the case through the NPA or in the negotiations\nleading to the agreement. OPR deems a current or former Department atorney to be a subject of\nits investigation when the individual’s conduct is within the scope of OPR’s review and may result\nin a finding of professional misconduct. OPR reviewed prior public statements made by Acosta\nand another subject. All five subjects cooperated fully with OPR’s investigation. OPR requested\nthat all of the subjects provide writen responses detailing their involvement in the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions relating to victim\nnotification and consultation. OPR received and reviewed writen responses from all of the\nsubjects, and subsequently conducted extensive interviews of each subject under oath and before\na court reporter. Each subject was represented by counsel and had access to relevant\ncontemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview. The subjects reviewed and\nprovided comments on their respective interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report. OPR\n6 The federal government was closed from December 22, 2ol8, to January 25, 2ol9.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.® Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nTW. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\ni In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\n8 OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nvil\nDOJ-OGR-oooo254l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002601.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 29 of 38\ndrafted and executed by the government’s agents in the SDFL, and because Epstein performed\nunder the contract by entering a plea in a Florida court, any conflict of laws between the Second\nCircuit and the Eleventh Circuit should be resolved in favor of the application of Eleventh\nCircuit law to the NPA.\n\nThe Eleventh Circuit has not directly addressed whether a plea agreement or non-\nprosecution agreement signed by one USAO is binding on a USAO in another district. But it\nmay be presumed, as it frequently is when predicting hou a state’s highest court would rule in a\ncase of first impression, that the Eleventh Circuit would follou the weight of authority. See, e.g.,\nCrutsinger v. Hess, 4o8 F. Supp. 548, 554 (D.

See, e.g., United States v. Gebbie, 294 F.3d 54o, 547-49 (3d Cir. 2oo2) (characterizing\nthe Second Circuit’s statement in Annabi as an “illogical posture” unsupported by the prior\nSecond Circuit cases on which it relied); United States v.

The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged\nin illegal sexual activity with girls.! OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors commited\nprofessional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was\nsigned or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.\nI. OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein\nin 2oo5, after the parents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.\nEpstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and\nother United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. Ata July 3l,\n2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if Epstein pled\nguilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration, registered as a\nsexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain monetary\ndamages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications with\nEpstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7. The\n: As used in this Report, including in quoted documents and statements, the word “girls” refers to females who\nwere under the age of l8 at the time of the alleged conduct. Under Florida law, a minor is a person under the age\nof l8.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2629\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002634.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42-2 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 8 of l4\nan investigation into the mater and would review the USAO’s decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through the NPA.°\n\nAfter the district court issued its ruling in the CVRA litigation, on February 2l, 2ol9, OPR\nincluded within the scope of its investigation an examination of the government’s conduct that\nformed the basis for the court’s findings that the USAO violated the CVRA in failing to afford\nvictims a reasonable right to confer with the government about the NPA before the agreement was\nsigned and that the government affirmatively misled victims about the status of the federal\ninvestigation.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department components, including the Office of\nthe Deputy Atorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys.\nThe records included emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected\nand reviewed materials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein. OPR also\nexamined extensive publicly available information, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and\nother court records, and reviewed media reports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books\nrelating to the Epstein case.\n\nIn addition to this extensive documentary review, OPR conducted more than 6o interviews\nof witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI administrative personnel;\ncurrent and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former Department atorneys and senior\nmanagers, including a former Deputy Atorney General and a former <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General\nfor the Criminal Division; and the former State Atorney and former <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney in\ncharge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed several victims and atorneys\nrepresenting victims, and reviewed writen submissions from victims, concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and the FBI.\n\nOPR identified former U.S. Atorney Acosta, three former USAO supervisors, and the\nAUSA as subjects of its investigation based on preliminary information indicating that each of\nthem was involved in the decision to resolve the case through the NPA or in the negotiations\nleading to the agreement. OPR deems a current or former Department atorney to be a subject of\nits investigation when the individual’s conduct is within the scope of OPR’s review and may result\nin a finding of professional misconduct. OPR reviewed prior public statements made by Acosta\nand another subject. All five subjects cooperated fully with OPR’s investigation. OPR requested\nthat all of the subjects provide writen responses detailing their involvement in the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions relating to victim\nnotification and consultation. OPR received and reviewed writen responses from all of the\nsubjects, and subsequently conducted extensive interviews of each subject under oath and before\na court reporter. Each subject was represented by counsel and had access to relevant\ncontemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview. The subjects reviewed and\nprovided comments on their respective interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report. OPR\n. The federal government was closed from December 22, 2ol8, to January 25, 2ol9. After initiating its\ninvestigation, OPR also subsequently received other leters from U.S. Senators and Representatives inquiring into the\nstatus of the OPR investigation.\n\nvl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2634\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002635.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42-2 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 9 of l4\ncarefully considered the comments and made changes, or noted comments, as OPR deemed\nappropriate; OPR did not, houever, alter its findings and conclusions.\n\nFinally, OPR reviewed relevant case law, statutes, regulations, Department policy, and\natorney professional responsibility rules as necessary to resolve the issues presented in this case\nand to determine whether the subjects commited professional misconduct.\n\nAs part of its investigation, OPR examined the interactions between state officials and the\nfederal investigators and prosecutors, but because OPR does not have jurisdiction over state\nofficials, OPR did not investigate, or reach conclusions about, their conduct regarding the state\ninvestigation.’ Because OPR’s mission is to ensure that Department atorneys adhere to the\nstandards of professional conduct, OPR’s investigation focused on the actions of the subject\natorneys rather than on determining the full scope of Epstein’s and his assistants’ criminal\nbehavior. Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.* Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\nL In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\nE OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nVil\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2635\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002728.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l58 Filed o2/o5/2l Page 2 of 2\nPage 2\nbefore being provided to the inmate recipient. Due to the large number of MDC inmates and the\nvolume of mail received at the MDC, this process can take multiple days. As noted above,\nhouever, the defendant is able to send and receive emails with defense counsel every day and has\nregular communication with counsel via VTC.\n\nMDC staff conduct two pat-doun searches of the defendant per day: once when she is\nmoved from her isolation cell to the day room each morning, and once when returns from the day\nroom to her isolation cell each night. As part of those searches, the defendant is required to remove\nher mask and open her mouth briefly so that MDC staff, who remain masked during the searches,\ncan confirm she has not hidden contraband in her mouth. These pat-doun and mouth searches are\nconsistent with MDC’s policy that all inmates be searched whenever they move to a different\nlocation within the jail facility. Previously, the defendant atended VTC conferences in a separate\npart of the MDC, requiring that she be searched when taken to and from her VTC calls with\ncounsel. Recently, houever, the MDC changed the location of the defendant’s VTC calls so that\nthe defendant does not need to leave her unit in order to atend VTC calls with her counsel, thereby\nreducing the number of searches. During the suspension of visitation, the defendant has not been\nstrip searched. When visitation resumes, the defendant, like all other inmates, will be strip\nsearched after any in-person visit.\n\nIn addition, MDC staff search the defendant’s cell for contraband once per day. MDC staff\nalso conduct a body scan on the defendant once per week to check for any secreted contraband.\nAt night, MDC staff are required to confirm that the defendant is not in distress every fifteen\nminutes.

Mot. 3 at lo).

(/d. at 2, 8).\n\nThat is not so. While a nou former <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> United States Atorney (““AUSA-l”) met\nwith a lawyer from Boies Schiller and two other atorneys about Epstein in February 2ol6, that\nmeeting was not focused on the defendant, and AUSA-l did not participate in a second meeting\nwith those atorneys. Moreover, that February 2ol6 meeting pre-dated the depositions that gave\nrise to the perjury counts in the Indictment, which itself was obtained more than four years\nthereafter.° The Indictment was instead the product of an investigation that was not opened until\nlate 2ol8 and that had nothing to do with a meeting that had taken place nearly three years earlier\nwith an AUSA who played no part in the decision to open the 2ol8 investigation and similarly\nplayed no part in the 2ol8 investigation itself.\n\nl.

The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged\nin illegal sexual activity with girls.' OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors commited\nprofessional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was\nsigned or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.\nl. OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein\nin 2oo5, after the parents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.\nEpstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and\nother United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. At a\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if\nEpstein pled guilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration,\nregistered as a sexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain\nmonetary damages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications\nwith Epstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7.

OPR deems a current or former Department atorney to be a subject of\nits investigation when the individual’s conduct is within the scope of OPR’s review and may result\nin a finding of professional misconduct. OPR reviewed prior public statements made by Acosta\nand another subject. All five subjects cooperated fully with OPR’s investigation.

OPR received and reviewed writen responses from all of the\nsubjects, and subsequently conducted extensive interviews of each subject under oath and before\na court reporter. Each subject was represented by counsel and had access to relevant\ncontemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea.

OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\ni In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\n8 OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nvil\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l85\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003203.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27 of 348\nCHAPTER ONE\nSIGNIFICANT ENTITIES AND INDIVIDUALS\nl.

Alexander Acosta was appointed Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally nominated\nAcosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially appointed in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and child sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide supervisory oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8. On December 8, 2oo8, after the presidential election and while Epstein was serving his state\nprison sentence, Acosta was formally recused from all maters involving the law firm of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003207.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l of 348\nKirkland & Ellis, which was representing Epstein, because Acosta had begun discussions with the\nfirm about possible employment.\n\nAfter leaving the USAO in June 2oo9, Acosta became the Dean of the Florida International\nUniversity College of Law. In April 2ol7, Acosta became the U.S. Secretary of Labor, but he\nresigned from that post effective July l9, 2ol9, follouing public criticism of the USAO’s handling\nof the Epstein case.\n\nJeffrey H. Sloman joined the USAO in l99o as a line AUSA. In 2ool, he became Deputy\nChief of the USAO’s Fort Lauderdale branch office Narcotics and Violent Crimes Section, and in\n2oo3, became the Managing AUSA for that branch office. In early 2oo4, Sloman was appointed\nChief of the USAO’s Criminal Division. In October 2oo6, Sloman became the FAUSA, and\nSloman’s office was located with Acosta’s in the Miami office’s executive suite.\n\nAs FAUSA, Sloman was responsible for supervising the Civil, Criminal, and Appellate\nDivisions, and he was part of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein investigation.\nAlthough Sloman had relatively litle involvement in the decisions and negotiations that led to the\nNPA and did not review it before it was signed, he personally negotiated an addendum to the NPA,\nwhich he signed on behalf of the USAO in October 2oo7. After subordinates Mathew Menchel\nand Andrew Lourie left the USAO, Sloman directly engaged with the line AUSA, Marie Villafafia,\non Epstein maters, and participated in meetings and other communications with defense counsel.\nAfter Acosta was formally recused from the Epstein mater in December 2oo8, Sloman became\nthe senior USAO official supervising the mater. When Acosta left the USAO, Sloman became\nthe Acting U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida, and in January 2olo, the Atorney\nGeneral appointed Sloman to be the Interim U.S. Atorney for the district. Sloman left the USAO\nto enter private practice in June 2olo.\n\nMathew I. Menchel joined the USAO in l998 after having served as a New York County\n(Manhatan) <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> District Atorney for ll years. After several years as a line AUSA, Menchel\nbecame Chief of the USAO’s Major Crimes Section. In October 2oo6, Menchel became the Chief\nof the USAO’s Criminal Division, based in Miami. As Criminal Division Chief, Menchel was\npart of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein investigation, and he participated in meetings\nand other communications with defense counsel. Menchel participated in the decision to extend a\ntwo-year state-based plea proposal to Epstein and communicated it to the defense. Shortly after\nthat plea offer was extended to Epstein in early August 2oo7, and before the precise terms of the\nNPA were negotiated with defense counsel, Menchel left the USAO to enter private practice.\n\nAndrew C. Lourie joined the USAO as a line AUSA in l994, after having served for three\nyears as an AUSA in New Jersey. During his l3-year tenure at the USAO, Lourie served two\nterms on detail as the Acting Chief of the Department’s Criminal Division’s Public Integrity\nSection, first from September 2ool until September 2oo2, and then from February 2oo6 until July\n2oo6. Between those two details, and again after his return to the USAO in July 2oo6, Lourie was\na Deputy Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, serving as the Managing AUSA for the West\nPalm Beach branch office. Lourie was part of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein\ninvestigation and negotiated the NPA, participating in meetings and other communications with\ndefense counsel. During September 2oo7, while the NPA was being negotiated, Lourie\ntransitioned out of the USAO to serve on detail as the Principal Deputy <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003208.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 32 of 348\nfor the Department’s Criminal Division, a position in which he served as Chief of Staff to <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span>\nAtorney General Alice Fisher. Lourie left the Department in February 2oo8 to enter private\npractice.\n\nAnn Marie C. Villafaia joined the USAO in September 2ool as a line AUSA. She served\nin the Major Crimes Section in Miami until January 2oo4, when she transferred to the West Palm\nBeach branch office. Villafafia handled the majority of the child exploitation cases in West Palm\nBeach, along with other criminal maters. In 2oo6, she was designated as the USAO’s first\ncoordinator for Project Safe Childhood, a new Department initiative focusing on child sexual\nexploitation and abuse.”\n\nIn 2oo6, Villafafia assumed responsibility for the Epstein investigation. As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s compliance with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct. After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking enforcement of their rights\nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l (“the CVRA litigation” or “the\nCVRA case”), in July 2oo8, Villafafia served as co-counsel to the lead atorney representing the\nUSAO until February 2ol9, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.?

JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.4 Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span> to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime.° He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n+ Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media. See, e.g., Landon Thomas\nJr., “Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery,” New York, Oct. 28, 2oo2; Vicky Ward, “The Talented Mr.\nEpstein,” Vanity Fair, Mar. 2oo3; James Barron, “Who Is Jeffrey Epstein?

OVERVIEW\nIn the follouing sections in this chapter, the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR)\n\ndetails the significant events leading to, and during, the federal investigation of Epstein; the\nnegotiation and signing of the NPA; and the defense’s subsequent nine-month effort to stop the\nNPA from taking effect. OPR also describes more briefly the events occurring after Epstein pled\nguilty in state court, as the USAO sought to hold him to the terms of the agreement. In describing\nevents, OPR relies heavily on contemporaneous documents, particularly emails. In many\ninstances, the emails not only describe meetings and identify the participants, but also set forth the\nissues under discussion, the alternatives considered, and the basis for certain decisions. When\nhelpful to explain the actions taken by the subjects, OPR also includes the subjects’ explanations\nas provided in their writen responses to, or interviews with, OPR, or explanations provided by\nwitnesses.\n\nA timeline of key events is set forth on the follouing page.\n\nIl. MARCH 2oo5 — MAY 2oo6: EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM\nBEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE\nATTORNEY’S OFFICE\nA. The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, identified as the recipient of the massage, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\n6 As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per massage. The girl claimed that there were nude photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed.\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\ninvestigate prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003214.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 38 of 348\n. . . . .\nTimeline of Key Events for Federal Epstein Investigation — May 2oo6 through October 2oo8\nMay 23 — Villafafia opens Sept 7 — Acosta, Sloman, Villafaia May l9 — Epstein’s counsel sends\nfederal investigation into [+others] meet with Epstein’s counsel leter to Deputy Atorney General's\nJeffrey Epstein Office requesting review\nSept l2 — Lourie, Villafafia [+others]\nJuly l4 — Villafafia meet with Epstein’s counsel and the\nfirst briefing to State Atorney's Office to discuss June 23 — Deputy Atorney\nAcosta and Sloman state-based resolution General’s Office sends leter\nto Epstein’s counsel\nese 5 Slian Haceines declining to intervene\nFirst <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> United Sept 24 —NPA is signed, Lourie\nStates Atorney; Menchel leaves USAO for position in |\nbecomes Criminal Chief DOJ Criminal Division | June 3o — Epstein pleads\nguilty in state court and is\n| sentenced\n2oo6 2oo7 2oo8\nMay l — Villafaia Oct l2 — Acosta has July 7 — Jane Doe files an\ncompletes draft breakfast meeting emergency petition against\nprosecution memorandum | with Lefkouitz the United States asserting\n= violations of the CVRA\nJune 26 — Sloman, Menchel, Oct 29/3o —NPA : :\nLourie, Villafatia, and FBI meet Addendum signed\nwith Epstein’s counsel\nFeb 25-29 — DOJ sect oats\nJuly 26 Villafatia learns from Menchel Criminal Division/CEOS | begins work\nthat Acosta decided to offer Epstein a begins review release program\ntwo-year state-based resolution\nJuly 3l — Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, Villafafia, May l5 — Criminal Division leter\nand FBI agents meet with Epstein’s counsel to to Epstein’s counsel supporting =|\npropose two-year state-based resolution federal Epstein prosecution\nAug 3 — Menchel’s last day at USAO; sends\nleter to Epstein’s counsel reiterating terms\nl2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo32l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003215.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 39 of 348\nand some of the victims as well, regularly recruited local high-school-age girls to give him\nmassages in his home that, in some cases, led to sexual activity.\n\nThrough their interviews with victims, the police learned more about Epstein’s conduct.\nSome girls had only one encounter with Epstein, while others had many encounters with him.

According to\nthe information provided to, and evidence gathered by, the PBPD, Epstein’s assistants scheduled\nup to three massage appointments each day, often contacting the girls to make an appointment\nwhile Epstein was en route to Palm Beach from one of his other residences. Typically, when a girl\narrived at Epstein’s home for a massage, she was taken upstairs to the master bedroom and\nbathroom area by one of Epstein’s assistants, who set up a massage table and massage oils. When\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span> left the room, Epstein entered, wearing only a robe or a touel. After removing his\nclothing, Epstein lay face doun and nude on the massage table, instructed the girl to remove her\nclothing, and then explained to her hou he wished her to perform the massage. During the\nmassage, Epstein masturbated himself, often while fondling the girl performing the massage.\nWhen Epstein climaxed, the massage was over. Usually, Epstein paid the girl $2oo for the\nmassage, and if she had not been to his home before, Epstein asked for her phone number to contact\nher in the future. Epstein encouraged the girls who performed these massages to find other girls\ninterested in performing massages for him, and promised that if a girl brought a friend along to\nperform a massage, each girl would receive $2oo. Several of the victims acknouledged to the\nPBPD that they had recruited other girls on Epstein’s behalf.\n\nThe evidence regarding Epstein’s knouledge of the girls’ ages was mixed. Some girls who\nrecruited other girls reportedly instructed the new recruits to tell Epstein, if asked, that they were\nover l8 years old. Houever, some girls informed the PBPD that they told Epstein their real ages.\nPolice were able to corroborate one girl’s report that Epstein sent flouers to her at her high school\nafter she performed in a school play. In addition, an employee of Epstein told the PBPD that some\nof the females who came to Epstein’s residence appeared to be underage.\n\nEpstein was aware of the PBPD investigation almost from the beginning. He retained local\ncriminal defense counsel, who in turn hired private investigators. In October 2oo5, the PBPD,\nwith the assistance of the State Atorney’s Office, obtained a search warrant for Epstein’s\nresidence. When police arrived at Epstein’s home on October 2o, 2oo5, to execute the warrant,\n7 According to the PBPD records, investigators obtained no allegations or evidence that any person other than\nthis female <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span> participated in the sexual activity with the girls.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003216.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 4o of 348\nthey found computer monitors and keyboards in the home, as well as disconnected surveillance\ncameras, but the computer equipment itself—including video recordings and other electronic\nstorage media—were gone. Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home,\nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a\ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments. The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, ““Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.”\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\n8 Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n? In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003217.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 4l of 348\ntold OPR that Epstein’s local counsel brought atorney Alan Dershouitz to see Krischer and the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney, but Dershouitz was “overly aggressive” and threatened, “We’re going\nto destroy your witnesses; don’t go to court because we’re going to destroy those girls.” According\nto Krischer, Dershouitz so “tainted the waters” that Epstein also hired local atorney Jack\nGoldberger, with whom Krischer had “a working relationship.” Because the husband of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney was Goldberger’s law partner, Belohlavek recused the <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State\nAtorney to remove “even the appearance of any kind of conflict” of interest, and Belohlavek took\nover the case. Goldberger, together with Gerald Lefcourt, a nationally knoun New York criminal\ndefense atorney also representing Epstein, then directed their efforts at Belohlavek and Krischer\nto dissuade the office from prosecuting Epstein, largely by atacking the credibility of the victim\nwitnesses.\n\nMeanwhile, the State Atorney’s Office took the unusual step of preparing to present the\ncase to a grand jury. Krischer told OPR that under state law as it existed until changed in 2ol6,\nhis office prosecuted minors as young as l4 for prostitution.!° The possibility that Epstein’s\nvictims themselves could have been prosecuted caused “great consternation within the office,” and\naccording to Krischer, resulted in the decision to put the case before the grand jury.'' Belohlavek\ntold OPR that her office took the allegations against Epstein “seriously, because . . . it was an\norganized scheme to involve young girls by offering them money. And I wouldn’t say that we...\nthought they were prostitutes . . . [but] I think there was solicitation.”” Houever, she said, although\nEpstein’s “behavior was reprehensible, . . . I’m limited by . . . the state statutes as to what I can\ncharge.” Krischer told OPR, “There were so many issues involving the victim-witnesses that to\nmy mind, in consultation with my [prosecutors], the only way to achieve, to my mind, real justice\nwas to present the case to the grand jury and not to direct-file” criminal charges against Epstein.\n\nC. Florida State Procedure for Bringing Criminal Charges\n\nFederal criminal procedure requires that a felony charge—that is, any charge punishable\nby imprisonment for one year or more—be brought by a grand jury unless waived by a defendant.”\nUnder Florida law, houever, a grand jury is required to bring criminal charges only in a death\npenalty case.'? For all other cases, a State Atorney has concurrent authority to file criminal\ncharges by means of a document called an “information” or to seek a grand jury indictment.\nAlthough Florida criminal cases are routinely charged by information, state grand juries are often\nutilized in sensitive or high-profile cases, such as those involving allegations of wrongdoing by\npublic officials.'* Florida grand jury proceedings are subject to strict secrecy rules that, among\nlo Belohlavek told OPR that prostitution was a misdemeanor charge, and she did not handle misdemeanors.\nA Because the Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigation into the State Atorney’s Office’s\nhandling of the Epstein case was pending at the time OPR interviewed Krischer, he declined to further explain to OPR\nhis office’s prosecutive decisions.\nlB U.S. Const. amend.

PBPD Chief Reiter Becomes Concerned with the State Atorney’s Office’s\n\nHandling of the State Investigation and Seeks a Federal Investigation\n\nIn 2oo6, PBPD Chief Reiter perceived that Krischer’s atitude had changed and, according\n\nto Reiter’s statements in his 2oo9 deposition, Krischer said that he did not believe the victims were\ncredible. Reiter was disturbed when Krischer suggested that the PBPD issue a notice for Epstein\nto appear in court on misdemeanor charges, leading Reiter to begin questioning Krischer’s\nobjectivity and the State Atorney’s Office’s approach to the case. As Reiter explained in his\ndeposition:\n\nThis was a case that I felt absolutely needed the atention of the State\n\nAtorney’s Office, that needed to be prosecuted in state court. It’s\n\nnot generally something that’s prosecuted in a federal court. And I\n\nknew that it didn’t really mater what the facts were in this case, it\n\nwas prety clear to me that Mr. Krischer did not want to prosecute\n\nthis case.\n\nOn May l, 2oo6, Reiter submited to Krischer probable cause affidavits and a case filing\npackage relating to Epstein, one of his personal assistants, and a young local woman whom Epstein\nfirst victimized and then used to recruit other girls. In his transmital leter, which was later made\npublic, Reiter criticized Krischer, noting that he found the State Atorney’s Office’s “treatment of\nthese cases [to be] highly unusual.”!© Reiter urged Krischer “to examine the unusual course that\nyour office’s handling of this mater has taken” and to consider disqualifying himself from\nprosecuting Epstein. !’\n\nIW. THE FBI AND THE USAO INVESTIGATE EPSTEIN, AND THE DEFENSE\n\nTEAM ENGAGES WITH THE USAO\n\nA. May 2oo6 — February 2oo7: The Federal Investigation Is Initiated, and the\n\nUSAO Opens a Case File\n\nIn early 2oo6, a West Palm Beach FBI Special Agent who worked closely with\nAUSA Ann Marie Villafafia on child exploitation cases—and who is referred to in this Report as\n“the case agent”—mentioned to Villafafia in “casual conversations” having learned that the PBPD\nwas investigating a wealthy Palm Beach man who recruited minors for sexual activity. The case\nagent told Villafafia that the PBPD had reached out to the FBI because the State Atorney’s Office\nwas considering either not charging the case or allouing the defendant to plead to a misdemeanor\nls Fla. Stat. § 9o5.27 (2oo7).\n\nl6 See Larry Keller, “Palm Beach chief focus of fire in Epstein case,” Palm Beach Post, Aug. l4, 2oo6.\nM7 As noted, Krischer generally declined in his OPR interview to explain his office’s prosecutive decisions;\nhouever, regarding allegations of favoritism to Epstein’s defense counsel, Krischer told OPR, “I just don’t play that\nway.”\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003219.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 43 of 348\ncharge. Villafafia suggested meeting with the PBPD, but the case agent explained that before\nformally presenting the case to the FBI, the PBPD wanted to see hou the State Atorney’s Office\ndecided to charge Epstein.\n\nl. The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'* At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his background.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the Detective expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.'? The Detective\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose relationship with the <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span>\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\nDetective told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the Detective acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The Detective died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003222.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 46 of 348\n4. Late July 2oo6: The State Indicts Epstein, and the USAO Moves\nForward with a Federal Investigation\n\nSeveral days after Villafafia spoke with Acosta and Sloman, on July l9, 2oo6, <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span>\nState Atorney Belohlavek presented the case to the state grand jury.> Krischer told OPR that\n“the whole thing” was put before the grand jury. According to a statement made at the time by the\nState Atorney’s Office spokesman, the grand jury was presented with a list of charges from highest\nto louest, without a recommendation by the prosecutor, and deliberated with the prosecutor out of\nthe room.”* The state grand jury returned an indictment charging Epstein with one count of felony\nsolicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7, a felony under state law because\nit alleged three or more instances of solicitation.” The indictment did not identify the person or\npersons solicited and made no mention of the fact that Epstein had solicited minors.”® On July 23,\n2oo6, Epstein self-surrendered to be arrested on the indictment, but was not detained, and the\ncharges were made public.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she decided to move forward with the federal investigation at that\npoint because she believed the State Atorney’s Office would permit Epstein to enter a plea to a\nreduced misdemeanor charge and that once he entered a guilty plea, the Department’s Petite policy\nmight preclude a federal prosecution.?’ Villafafia told OPR that at the time, she “definitely\nbelieved that we were going to proceed to [a federal] indictment, assuming that ...we had\nsufficient evidence.”\neS Villafafia and the FBI obtained and examined records of the state grand jury proceeding, and Lourie reviewed\nthem. Because the grand jury records have not been ordered released publicly, OPR does not discuss their substance\nin this Report.\nat Larry Keller, “Police say lawyer tried to discredit teenage girls,” Palm Beach Post, July 29, 2oo6, citing\nstatement by State Atorney’s Office spokesman Michael Edmondson.\n28 Indictment in State v. Epstein, 2oo6CF9454AXX (July l9, 2oo6), atached as Exhibit l to this Report.\n26 In pertinent part, the state indictment read, “[B]etween the lst day of August [2oo4] and October 3l, 2oo5,\n[Epstein] did solicit, induce, entice, or procure another to commit prostitution lewdness, or assignation, . . . on three\nor more occasions.” The l5-month time frame and lack of detail regarding the place or manner of the offense made\nit impossible to identify from the charging document which victim or victims served as the basis for the charge in the\nstate indictment. Belohlavek explained to OPR that the charge did not list specific victims so that she could go forward\nat trial with whichever victim or victims might be available and willing to testify at that time.\n27 The Petite policy is a set of guidelines used by federal prosecutors when considering whether to pursue federal\ncharges for defendants previously prosecuted for state or local offenses. The Constitution does not prohibit the federal\ngovernment from prosecuting defendants who have been charged, acquited, or convicted on state charges based on\nthe same criminal conduct. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing principle that the prohibition\nagainst double jeopardy does not apply to prosecutions brought by different sovereigns. See, e.g., Gamble v. United\nStates, 587 U.S. ___, l39 S. Ct. l96o, l966-67 (2ol9) (and cases cited therein); Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S.\nl87, l95 (l959) (and cases cited therein); and United States v. Lanza, 26o U.S. 377, 382 (l922). Nonetheless, to\nbeter promote the efficient use of criminal justice resources, the Department developed policies in l959 and l96o to\nguide federal prosecutors in the use of their charging discretion. See Chapter Two, Part Two, Section IT.A.2, for a\nmore detailed discussion of the Petite policy.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3222\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003235.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 59 of 348\n\nfor meetings was to cause delay, but “the people in my office either couldn’t see that or didn’t\nwant to see that,” perhaps because of “their lack of experience with these types of cases” or a\nmisguided belief “that [Epstein’s] atorneys would not engage in this behavior.” Villafafia told\nOPR that she “could not seem to get [her supervisors] to understand the seriousness of Epstein’s\nbehavior and the fact that he was probably continuing to commit the behavior, and that there was\na need to move with necessary speed.” Nonetheless, Villafafia folloued the guidance of her\nimmediate supervisor and did not send the email.\n\nLike Lourie, Menchel told OPR that he believed meeting with defense counsel was good\npractice. Menchel told OPR that he saw “no dounside” to hearing the defense point of view.\nDefense counsel might make a persuasive point “that’s actually going to change our mind,” or\nalternatively, present arguments the defense would inevitably raise if the case went forward, and\nMenchel believed it would be to the USAO’s advantage to learn about such arguments in advance.\nMenchel also told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia ever articulating a concern that Epstein was\ncontinuing to offend, and in Menchel’s view, Epstein was “already under a microscope, at least in\nFlorida,” and it would have been “the height of stupidity” for Epstein to continue to offend in those\ncircumstances.\n\nE. June 2oo7: Villafaia Supplements the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nWhile Villafafia’s supervisors were considering whether to go forward with the proposed\ncharges, Villafafia took additional steps to support them. On June l4, 2oo7, she supplemented the\nprosecution memorandum with an addendum addressing “credibility concerns” relating to one of\nthe victims. In the email transmiting the addendum to Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her\nimmediate supervisor, Villafafia reported, “another Jane Doe has been identified and interviewed,”\nand the “different strategies” about hou to structure the charges left Villafafia unsure whether “to\nmake . . . changes nou or wait until we have received approval of the current charging strategy.”\nThe addendum itself related to a particular victim referred to as the minor who “saw Epstein most\nfrequently” and who had allegedly engaged in sexual activity with both Epstein and an Epstein\n<span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span>. In the addendum, Villafafia identified documents she had found corroborating four\nseparate statements made by this victim.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that the only victim about whom any supervisor ever articulated\nspecific credibility issues was the victim discussed in the addendum. Lourie told OPR that he had\nno specific recollection of the addendum, but it was “reasonable” to assume that the addendum\naddressed one particular victim because no one had identified specific concerns relating to any\nother victim. Villafafia’s immediate supervisor similarly told OPR that to her recollection, the\ndiscussions about credibility issues were generic rather than tied to specific victims.\n\nF. The June 26, 2oo7 Meeting with Defense Counsel\n\nMenchel agreed to meet with defense counsel on June 26, 2oo7, communicating directly\nwith Sanchez about the arrangements. At Menchel’s instruction, on June l8, 2oo7, Villafafia sent\na leter to defense counsel identifying what she described as “the statutes under consideration.”””!\n3 Villafafia sent copies of this leter to both Menchel and Sanchez. Villafafia told OPR that she objected to\nsending this information to the defense. Although Menchel did not recall directing Villafafia to send the leter to\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3235\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003242.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 66 of 348\nMenchel could not recall who initially suggested a state plea, but noted to OPR that his\n\noun “emails . .. make clear that this course of action was ultimately decided by Alex Acosta.” He\nreferenced, among others, his May l4, 2oo7 email to Villafafia informing her that Acosta was\ndeciding hou he wanted to handle the case. Menchel surmised that a state resolution accomplished\ntwo things that Acosta viewed as important: first, it resolved any Petite policy concerns, and\nsecond, it afforded more flexibility in sentencing than a federal plea would have alloued. Menchel\ntold OPR that the state plea proposal did not reflect any minimization of Epstein’s conduct and\nthat any state plea would have been to an offense that required sexual offender registration. He\ntold OPR, “I don’t think anybody sat around and said, you knou, it’s not that big a deal. That was\nnot the reaction that I think anybody had from the federal side of this case.” Rather, Menchel said,\n“The concern was if we charge him [as proposed], there’s going to be a trial.”\n\nDe July 2oo7: Villafaia and Menchel Disagree about the Proposed State\n\nResolution\nVillafafia told OPR that she was angry when she received Menchel’s July email explaining\n\nthat he had proposed to Sanchez resolving the federal investigation through a state plea. In\nVillafafia’s view, the proposed state resolution “didn’t make any sense” and “did not correspond”\nto Department policy requiring that a plea offer reflect “the most serious readily provable\noffense.”® In her view, a plea to a state charge “obviously” would not satisfy this policy. Villafafia\nalso told OPR that in her view, the USAM required the USAO to confer with the investigative\nagency about plea negotiations, and Villafafia did not believe the FBI would be in favor of a state\nplea. Villafafia also believed the CVRA required atorneys for the government to confer with\nvictims before making a plea offer, but the victims had not been consulted about this proposal.\nVillafafia told OPR she had met with some of the victims during the course of the investigation\nwho had negative impressions of the State Atorney’s Office, and she believed that “sending them\nback to the State Atorney’s Office was not something” those victims would support.\n& This policy was set forth in a September 22, 2oo3 memorandum from then Atorney General John Ashcroft\nregarding “Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and Sentencing”\n(knoun as the “Ashcroft Memo”), which provided, in pertinent part:\n\n[I]n all federal criminal cases, federal prosecutors must charge and pursue the\n\nmost serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts\n\nof the case, except as authorized by an <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General, United States\n\nAtorney, or designated supervisory atorney in the limited circumstances\n\ndescribed belou. The most serious offense or offenses are those that generate the\n\nmost substantial sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, unless a mandatory\n\nminimum sentence or count requiring a consecutive sentence would generate a\n\nlonger sentence. A charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor has a good\n\nfaith doubt, for legal or evidentiary reasons, as to the Government’s ability readily\n\nto prove a charge at trial. Thus, charges should not be filed simply to exert\n\nleverage to induce a plea. Once filed, the most serious readily provable charges\n\nmay not be dismissed except to the extent permited [elsewhere in this\n\nMemorandum].\nSee also Chapter Two, Part Two, Section II.B.l.\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3242\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003244.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 68 of 348\nMenchel’s reply email began with a rebuke:\nBoth the tone and substance of your email are totally inappropriate\nand, in combination with other maters in the past, it seriously calls\nyour judgment into question.\nAs you well knou, the US Atorney has not even decided whether\nto go forward with a prosecution in this mater, thus you should have\nrespected his position before engaging in plea negotiations.\nAlong that same line, despite whatever contrary representations you\nmade to the agents in this mater, it was made clear to you by the US\nAtorney and the First <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> from the time when you were first\nauthorized to investigate Mr. Epstein that the office had concerns\nabout taking this case because of petit [sic] policy and a number of\nlegal issues. Despite being told these things, you prepared a pros\nmemo and indictment that included a definitive date for indictment.\nIt has come to my atention that you led the agents to believe that\nthe indictment of this mater was a foregone conclusion and that our\ndecision to put off that date and listen to the defense atorneys’\nconcerns is indicative of the office having second thoughts about\nindicting. As you well knew, you were never given authorization\nby anyone to seek an indictment in this case. °°\nIn the email, Menchel went on to explain the circumstances of his conversation with\nSanchez and respond to Villafafia’s complaints:\nLilly Sanchez called me before, not after, the June 26th meeting. It\nwas an informal discussion and not in the nature of an official plea\noffer but rather a feeling out by both sides as to what it might take\nto resolve the mater. As you are also well aware, the only reason\nwhy this office even agreed to look into the Epstein mater in the\nfirst instance was because of concerns that the State had not done an\nadequate job in vindicating the victims’ rights. As you and the\nagents conceded, had Epstein been convicted of a felony that\nresulted in a jail sentence and sex offender status, neither the FBI\nnor our office ever would have interceded. You should also knou\nthat my discussion with Lilly Sanchez was made with the US\nAtorney’s full knouledge. Had Lilly Sanchez expressed interest in\npursuing this avenue further, I certainly would have raised it with all\nthe interested individuals in this case, including you and the agents.\nIn any event, I fail to see hou a discussion that went nouhere has\nhurt our bargaining position.

If you\nwant to work major cases in the district you must understand and\naccept the fact that there is a chain of command — something you\ndisregard with great regularity.\n\nVillafafia acknouledged to OPR that as Criminal Division Chief, Menchel had authority to\ndeviate from the Ashcroft Memo requiring that guilty pleas be to the most serious readily provable\noffense. She disagreed, houever, with his representation about her initial meeting with Acosta\nand Sloman regarding the Epstein investigation, noting that Menchel had not been at that\nmeeting. Villafafia told OPR that no one had communicated to her the “concerns” Menchel\nmentioned, and she had not been given an opportunity to respond to those concerns.”\n\nA week later, Villafafia replied to Menchel’s email, reiterating her concerns about the\nprocess and that filing charges against Epstein was not moving forward:\n\nHi Mat -- My trial is over, so I nou have [ ] time to focus back on\n\nthis case and our e-mail exchange. There are several points in your\n6? Neither Menchel nor Villafafia could recall for OPR to what concerns they were referring. In commenting\non OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney noted that Acosta’s concerns were “the possibility that bringing a case with\nserious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal issues could result in an outcome that set back the development of\ntrafficking laws and result in an aggregate greater harm to trafficking victims.”\nob Menchel confirmed to OPR that he was not involved in the decision to initiate the federal investigation.\n69 Villafafia characterized Menchel’s email as “meant to intimidate” and told OPR that she felt “put in [her]\nplace” by him. She perceived that Menchel was making it clear that she should not “jump the chain of command.”\nMenchel, houever, asserted to OPR that Villafafia had a “history of resisting supervisory authority” that warranted.\nhis strong response.\n\n43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3245\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003247.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 7l of 348\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt of Epstein’s criminal culpability.\nLastly, I was not trying to “dictate” a meeting with the U.S. Atorney\nor anyone else.

She viewed Menchel’s\nmessage as a rejection of her request to make a presentation to Acosta, and she told OPR that even\nthough she regarded Sloman as a friend, she did not feel she could reach out even to him to raise\nher concerns.’! Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not “order” Villafafia to refrain from\nraising her concerns with Acosta, Sloman, or Lourie, and he did not believe his email to Villafafia\nforeclosed her from meeting with Acosta. Rather, “the context of this exchange is, she is running\nroughshod over the U.S. Atorney, and what I am saying to her is, there is a process. You’re not\nin charge of it. I’m not in charge of it. [Acosta’s] in charge of it.” Acosta, who was apparently\nnot aware of Villafafia’s email exchange with Menchel, told OPR that from his perspective,\nVillafafia was not “frozen out” of the case and that he would have met with her had she asked him\ndirectly for a meeting.\nB. Villafana Atempts to Obtain the Computer Equipment Missing from\nEpstein’s Palm Beach Home, but the Defense Team Opposes Her Efforts\nAs the USAO managers considered in July 2oo7 hou to resolve the federal investigation,\none item of evidence they did not have available to assist in that decision was the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s home before the PBPD executed its search warrant. Although\nVillafafia took steps to obtain the evidence, defense counsel continued to oppose her efforts.\n» Menchel forwarded this email to Sloman.\n4 Villafafia told OPR that she later spoke to Menchel, asking Menchel to redirect Sanchez to Villafafia, but that\nMenchel responded it was not Villafafia’s “place” to tell him to whom he should direct communications.\n45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3247\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003248.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 72 of 348\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n2 In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span>, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

Acosta Decides on a Resolution That Includes a Two-Year Term of\nIncarceration\n\nThe next critical step in the development of the NPA was the decision to propose a two-\nyear term of imprisonment. Although presented to the defense as the “minimum” the USAO would\naccept, in actuality the two-year proposal became only the starting point for the negotiations, with\nthe result that the defense continued to chip away at it as the negotiations continued. The\ncontemporaneous emails make no mention of any rationale for the decision to propose two years\nas the government’s beginning negotiating position, and nobody with whom OPR spoke was able\nto recall hou the decision was made. As discussed belou, Acosta did offer OPR an explanation,\nbut OPR was unable to find contemporaneous evidence supporting it.”°\n\nWhile the defense was communicating its objections to the federal investigation to\nVillafafia, Lourie, Menchel, and Sloman, Villafafia continued moving touard filing charges. On\nJuly l9, 2oo7, the day after receiving Oosterban’s email supporting a potential prosecution,\nVillafafia emailed Lourie and Menchel seeking approval to take further investigative steps\nregarding three of Epstein’s assistants. Houever, Menchel directed Villafafia to “hold off... until\nwe decide what course of action we are going to take on [E]pstein which should happen next\nweek.” Menchel told OPR that he did not specifically recall why he asked Villafafia to wait, but\nhe assumed it was because Acosta was deciding what course of action to take on the case.\n\nOn Monday, July 23, 2oo7, Menchel submited a resignation notice to Acosta, stating that\nhe would be leaving the USAO effective August 6, 2oo7.77\n\nl. The July 26, 2oo7 Meeting in Miami\n\nEarly on the morning of Thursday, July 26, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Menchel that she was\npreparing a new draft indictment containing revisions he had suggested, including removal of all\nbut three of the “travel counts” and “a large number of [the] overt acts,” and the addition of overt\nacts and counts relating to two additional victims; she would not, houever, have the revised\nindictment ready in time “for our discussion today” at their 2:oo p.m. meeting. Menchel told OPR\nthat the fact that he had both proposed revisions to the indictment and also directed Villafafia to\ndelay the investigative steps involving the assistants indicated that he was “trying to do something”\nwith the case, but was waiting for Acosta to decide the “underlying issue” of whether to proceed\nwith federal charges.\n\nAcosta made that decision on or before July 26, 2oo7. On that afternoon, Villafafia met in\nMiami with Menchel. She told OPR that Sloman, as well as the FBI case agents and their\nsupervisors, were also present, with Lourie participating by telephone. Villafafia told OPR that\nshe expected that the meeting, requested by Menchel, would address the direction of the\ninvestigation. Houever, Villafafia told OPR that after everyone had assembled, Menchel entered\nthe room and stated that Acosta “has decided to offer a two-year state deal.” According to\nSee Section IV.D.2 in this Part.\na As early as May 4, 2oo7, Menchel had informed Acosta that he was intending to leave the USAO to enter\nprivate practice.\n\n48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo325o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003260.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 84 of 348\nLILLY ANN SANCHEZ, Esq.\nAUGUST 3, 2oo7\nPAGE 2\nPlease let us knou your client's decision by no later than August l7.

Alexander Acosta\nUnited States Atorney\nMathew Menchel\nChief, Criminal Division\nce: Roy Black\nGerald B. Lefcourt\nR. Alexander Acosta\nJeffrey Sloman\nAndrew Louric\nA. Marie Villafafia\n\nMenchel told OPR that in his view, the two-year sentence established a “floor” for\nnegotiations and if Epstein rejected the offer, subsequent offers would require him to accept more\njail time rather than less. Menchel told OPR that the USAO was “leaving our options open” by\nretaining the option of a federal plea because he thought the defense was “trying . . . to get him\ninto a federal penitentiary.” The leter’s deadline of August l7, 2oo7, for acceptance of the\ngovernment’s offer was intended to accommodate Villafafia’s request that the deadline provide\nher with enough time to go to New York, pursue investigative steps involving two of Epstein’s\nassistants, do witness interviews, and take additional legal steps to obtain Epstein’s computers if\nEpstein rejected the deal. Menchel told OPR he considered August l7 to be a firm deadline: “[I]f\nyou tell someone they have two weeks, it should be two weeks.” Menchel signed and sent the\nleter on Friday, August 3, 2oo7, which was his last day at the USAO before joining a private law\nfirm.”\n\nThe follouing Monday, August 6, 2oo7, Villafafia contacted Menchel by email at his new\nfirm to inquire whether the leter to Epstein’s counsel had gone out on Friday. Villafafia explained\n92 Menchel told OPR that the timing of the leter to Sanchez was a “total coincidence,” and had nothing to do\nwith his impending departure from the USAO.\n\n58\nDOJ-OGR-oooo326o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003262.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 86 of 348\njurisdiction), while making clear that we are not talking about the\ndetails of the case, and (i) asking [CEOS Chief] Oosterba[an] to\nparticipate by teleconference, thereby intercepting the DC meeting.\nThoughts?\nAcosta told OPR that he had no concern about Departmental “scrutiny of the NPA scheme” and\nthat “[i]f anything,” he was concerned whether the Department might direct the USAO to “drop\nthis case.””°\n2. Leading to the Meeting with Defense Counsel, Investigative Steps Are\nPostponed, and the Defense Continues to Oppose Villafana’s Efforts to\nObtain the Computer Evidence\n\nOn August 8, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Acosta that she had spoken with Oosterban, who\nwas willing to join a meeting with the defense; although he could not do so in person until after\nAugust 2l, he was willing to participate by phone in order “to stay firm on our August l7th\ndeadline.” Villafafia also reiterated that she wanted to contact Epstein’s assistants in New York\nand to interview some of Epstein’s colleagues and former employees there. Noting that “there was\nsome concern about [taking the proposed investigative steps] while we are trying to negotiate a\nplea,” Villafafia asked Acosta for guidance. Lourie also emailed Acosta and Sloman, asking that\nthe USAO “stick to our deadline if possible.” Lourie pointed out that CEOS “has no approval\nauthority” and opined it was ‘“‘a bit extreme to allou the defense to keep arguing this [case] to\ndifferent agencies.” Acosta replied, “This will end up [at the Department] anyhou, if we don’t\nmeet with them. I’d rather keep it here. Brin[g]ing [the Chief of CEOS] in visibly does so. If our\ndeadline has to slip a bit . . . it’s worth it.”\n\nAs aresult, the investigative steps were postponed. On August lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLourie inquiring whether she could “still go ahead” with the New York trip and whether she could\noppose Black’s request to stay the litigation concerning the government’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s computer equipment until after Acosta’s meeting with the defense team. Villafafia was\nreluctant to delay the litigation and reported to Lourie that agents recently had interviewed a girl\nwho began seeing Epstein at age l4 and who was photographed in the nude by an Epstein <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span>.\nOn August l3, 2oo7, Villafafia advised Black that the USAO was not willing to agree to a stay of\nthe litigation. Houever, Sanchez reached out to Lourie on August 22, 2oo7, and obtained his\nagreement to a joint request for a stay until the week after Acosta’s meeting with defense counsel,\nwhich was scheduled for September 7, 2oo7.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, in her opinion, the defense efforts to put off the litigation\nconcerning the computers was “further evidence of the importance of [this] evidence.”?’ Villafafia\nsuspected the computers contained evidence that “would have put this case completely to bed.”\na In context, Acosta appeared to mean that although he was not concerned about the Department reviewing the\nNPA or its terms, he did have concerns that the Department would decide the USAO should not have accepted the\ncase because of a lack of federal interest and might direct the USAO to end its involvement in the mater.\n\na Menchel told OPR, on the other hand, “there could be a lot of reasons why” defense counsel would resist\n“turn[ing] over an entire computer.”\n6o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3262\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003264.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 88 of 348\nVillafafia added that the PBPD Chief had alerted the FBI that an upcoming news article would\nreport that Epstein was “going to plead to a state charge” and the PBPD Chief “wanted to knou if\nthe victims had been consulted about the deal.” Sloman forwarded Villafafia’s email to Acosta\nwith a note that read simply, “fyi.”\n\nLater that evening, Villafafia circulated to Sloman, Lourie, and Oosterban two alternative\ndocuments: a draft federal plea agreement and a draft NPA.!” The draft federal plea agreement,\nfollouing the USAO’s standard format, called for Epstein to plead guilty to a five-year conspiracy\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 37l to entice minors to engage in prostitution, an offense requiring registration\nas a sexual offender, with a Rule ll(c) binding sentence of two years’ imprisonment. The draft\nNPA contained the terms presented to the defense team on July 3l, 2oo7, and called for Epstein to\nenter a state plea by September 28, 2oo7. Villafafia told OPR that because she had never seen a\nnon-prosecution agreement before, she relied on a template she found either using USAO or the\nDepartment’s internal online resources, but she did not do any additional research regarding the\nuse of non-prosecution agreements. !°!\n\n3. September 7, 2oo7: Acosta, Other USAO Atorneys, and FBI\nSupervisors Meet with Epstein Atorneys Starr, Lefkouitz, and\nSanchez\n\nOn Friday, September 7, 2oo7, Acosta, Sloman, Villafafia, Villafafia’s co-counsel,\nOosterban, and one or two supervisory FBI agents met at the USAO’s West Palm Beach office\nwith defense atorneys Sanchez and, for the first time, Starr and Lefkouitz.' This was Acosta’s\nfirst meeting with Epstein’s defense team. Villafafia understood the purpose of this meeting was\nto afford Epstein’s counsel an opportunity to “make a pitch” as to why the case should not be\nprosecuted federally. Villafafia recalled that at a “pre-meet” before defense counsel arrived,\nAcosta did not express concern about the viability of the prosecution or the strength of the case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that the meeting was not “‘a negotiation,” but a chance for the defense to\npresent their arguments, which were made by Starr and focused primarily on federalism. Villafafia\nsimilarly recalled that the meeting mainly consisted of the defense argument that the Epstein case\nshould remain a state mater in which the USAO should not interfere. Both Villafafia and her\nco-counsel recalled that Starr addressed himself directly to Acosta, and that Starr, who had held\nSenate-confirmed positions in the government, commented to Acosta that he and Acosta were “the\nonly people in this room who have run the [gantlet] of confirmation by the Senate.” Acosta did\nnot recall the comment, but he told OPR, “[B]Jack in July, we had decided that we were going\nChapter Three, the Department’s position at the time was that victim consultation was not required in maters in which\nthe government did not pursue a federal charge.

When defense counsel\nobjected to the registration requirement, Acosta held firm, and he also rejected the defense proposal\nfor a sentence of home confinement. In a subsequent email exchange with Criminal Division\nDeputy <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General Sigal Mandelker, who supervised CEOS, Oosterban reported\nthat the meeting was “non-eventful,” noting that defense counsel argued “federalism” and might\napproach Criminal Division <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General Alice Fisher to present that argument\ndirectly to her.\n\nVI. SEPTEMBER 2oo7: THE PLEA NEGOTIATIONS INTENSIFY, AND IN THE\n\nPROCESS, THE REQUIRED TERM OF IMPRISONMENT IS REDUCED\n\nAcosta had dispensed with the August l7, 2oo7 plea deadline specified in Menchel’s\nAugust 3, 2oo7 leter, in order to allou the defense to meet with him. After that meeting, and\nalthough Villafafia continued to plan to file charges on September 25, no new plea deadline was\nestablished, and the negotiations continued through most of September.\n\nThe defense used that time to push the USAO to make concessions. Because Acosta was\nnot willing to compromise on the issue of sexual offender registration or providing a means\nthrough which the victims could seek monetary damages, the negotiations focused on the term of\nimprisonment. As the contemporaneous emails shou, the USAO did not hold to its position that\na two-year term of imprisonment was “the minimum” that the USAO would accept. To reach an\nagreement with the defense on Epstein’s sentence, the USAO explored possible pleas in either\nfederal or state court, or both, and Villafafia spent considerable time and effort working with\ndefense counsel on developing alternative pleas with various outcomes. In the course of that\nprocess, the agreement was revised to require that Epstein accept a sentence of l8 months, with\nthe understanding that under the state’s sentencing procedures, he would likely serve just l5\nmonths.\n\nA. The Incarceration Term Is Reduced from 24 Months to 2o Months\n\nShortly after the September 7, 2oo7 meeting, Epstein atorney Gerald Lefcourt, who had\nnot been present at the meeting, spoke with both Acosta and Lourie, and made a new counteroffer,\nproposing that Epstein serve l5 months in jail folloued by l5 months in home confinement. On\nthe afternoon of Monday, September lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, identifying issues she\nwanted to discuss with him, including her concern that defense counsel was pushing for a\nresolution that would allou Epstein to avoid incarceration and possibly sexual offender\nregistration. Villafafia stated that Lefcourt’s counteroffer was “a reasonable counteroffer in light\nof our starting position of 24 months,” but added that it was “a really lou sentence.” Villafafia\nlo3 Sloman echoed this point, telling OPR that Starr’s presentation focused on the issue of federalism, but the\nUSAO had already decided to defer prosecution to the state and after the meeting, the USAO continued on that path.\n\n63\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3265\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003266.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 9o of 348\nnoted that the revised charges involved l9 victims, so the defense proposal for a l5-month sentence\namounted to less than one month per victim. Villafafia requested that “whatever the U.S. Atorney\ndecides to do,” the agreement with Epstein should “follou . .. a version of my writen non-\nprosecution agreement” in order to “avoid any state shenanigans and . . . keep the defense on a\nstrict timeline.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia circulated to Acosta and Sloman a revised NPA that called for a\n2o-month jail sentence to be folloued by lo months of home confinement. This redrafted NPA\ncontained a provision that specified, “With credit for gain time, Epstein shall serve at least\nl7 months in a state correctional institution.”'°* Acosta reviewed the revised NPA and amended\nit to include a statement clarifying that it was Epstein’s obligation “to undertake discussions with\nthe State of Florida to ensure compliance with these procedures.” Villafafia sent her version of the\nrevised NPA to Lefcourt that afternoon and forwarded Acosta’s proposed change to him the\nfollouing day, after she learned of it.\n\nOn September ll, 2oo7, the court contacted Villafafia to inquire whether the USAO would\nbe prepared to proceed with the litigation concerning the computers the follouing day. At\nSloman’s direction, Villafafia asked the court to delay the hearing, and the court rescheduled it for\nthe follouing week. At the same time, anticipating that plea negotiations would fail, Villafafia\ncirculated a revised indictment to her co-counsel and Oosterban, seeking their feedback before\nsending it “through the chain of command.” Villafafia also sent Oosterban the revised NPA and\ntold him she was “still shooting for 9/25” to bring charges, assuming the defense declined the\nUSAO’s offer. Oosterban responded, “The counter-offering is unfortunate, but I suppose it’s\nunderstandable.”!\n\nThat afternoon, Lourie asked Villafafia, “What is our latest offer?” Villafafia responded,\n“Plead to the three specified [state] charges, a 3o-month sentence, split 2o in jail and lo in\n‘community control,’ and agree that the girls are victims for purposes of damages. We also put in\ndeadlines for a plea and sentencing date.”\n\nB. September l2, 2oo7: The USAO and Defense Counsel Meet with the State\n\nAtorney\n\nAlthough the USAO and defense counsel had been discussing resolving the federal\ninvestigation with a plea to state charges, there is no evidence that the USAO involved the State\nAtorney’s Office in those discussions until September l2, 2oo7. On that day, Lourie, Villafafia,\nand another USAO supervisor who would be replacing Lourie as manager of the USAO’s West\nPalm Beach office, and Epstein atorneys Lefkouitz, Lefcourt, and Goldberger met with State\nAtorney Barry Krischer and <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek. Other than Villafajia,\nfew of the participants had any memory of the meeting or the results of it. The available evidence\nindicates that the USAO made additional concessions during the meeting.\nlos Through “gain time,” Florida inmates can earn a reduction in their sentence for good behavior.\n\nlo5 Oosterban told OPR that he did not recall having read the NPA at this juncture and “had no involvement\nwith it.”\n64\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3266\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003270.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 94 of 348\nD. The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “‘victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: harassment to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month recommendation, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding recommendation that he be sentenced to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of community control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be appointed\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”'\"! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\nul The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR-oooo327o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003271.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 95 of 348\nto the assault charge” and suggesting a different factual scenario to support a federal charge.!’? At\nthis point, Sloman left on vacation, and he informed Acosta and Villafafia that in his absence\nLourie had agreed “to help finalize this.” Lourie spent the follouing work week at his new post\nat the Department in Washington, D.C., but communicated with his USAO colleagues by phone\nand email.\n\nIn a Sunday, September l6, 2oo7 email, Villafafia informed Lefkouitz that she had drafted\na factual proffer to accompany a revised “hybrid” federal plea proposal. In that email, Villafafia\nalso noted that she was considering filing charges in the federal district court in Miami, “which\nwill hopefully cut the press coverage significantly.” This email received considerable atention l2\nyears later when it was made public during the CVRA litigation and was viewed as evidence of\nthe USAO’s efforts to conceal the NPA from the victims. Villafafia, houever, explained to OPR\nthat she was concerned that news media coverage would violate the victims’ privacy. She told\nOPR, “[I]f [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into\nthe courthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper,” and that such publicity\nwas less likely to happen in Miami, where the press “in general does not care about what happens\nin Palm Beach.”\n\nLefkouitz responded to Villafafia with a revised version of her latest proposed “hybrid”\nplea agreement, in a document entitled “Agreement.” Significantly, this defense proposal\nintroduced two new provisions. The first related to four female assistants who had allegedly\nfacilitated Epstein in his criminal scheme. The defense sought a government promise not to\nprosecute them, as well as certain other unnamed Epstein employees, and a promise to forego\nimmigration proceedings against two of the female assistants:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also\n\nprecludes the initiation of any and all criminal charges which might\n\notherwise in the future be brought against [four named female\n\nassistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate\n\nentity] for any criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal\n\ninvestigation . . . . Further, no immigration proceeding will be\n\ninstituted against [two named female assistants] as a result of the\n\nongoing investigation.\n\nThe second new provision related to the USAO’s efforts to obtain Epstein’s computers:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement\n\nresolves any and all outstanding [legal process] that have requested\n\nwitness testimony and/or the production of documents and/or\n\ncomputers in relation to the investigation that is the subject of the\n\nAgreement. Each [legal process] will be withdrawn upon the\n\nexecution of the Agreement and will not be re-issued absent reliable\nM2 Villafafia told OPR that she sometimes used her home email account because “[n]egotiations were occurring\nat nights, on weekend[s], and while I was [away from the office for personal reasons], . . . and this occurred during a\ntime when out of office access to email was very limited.” Records shou her supervisors were aware that at times she\nused her personal email account in communicating with defense counsel in this case.\n\n69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo327l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003272.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 96 of 348\nevidence of a violation of the agreement. Epstein and his counsel\nagree that the computers that are currently under [legal process] will\nbe safeguarded in their current condition by Epstein’s counsel or\ntheir agents until the terms and conditions of the Agreement are\nfulfilled.\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a lengthy email to convey two options Lourie had\nsuggested: “the original proposal” for a state plea but with an agreement for an l8-month sentence,\nor pleas to state charges and two federal obstruction-of-justice charges. Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year conspiracy\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding recommendation for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\nsentenced in the state after he is sentenced in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be sentenced after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the resolution of all criminal liability, ‘and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she understood\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.!\"\n\nWith regard to immigration, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on immigration issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in connection with\ntheir immigration paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status. So there wasn’t any reason\nM3 OPR understood Villafafia’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry\ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to\ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3272\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003275.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 99 of 348\ntwelve months, with six served in home confinement, to run\nconsecutively.\n\nI just received an e-mail asking if Mr. Epstein could just do l2\nmonths imprisonment instead.\nAs you can see, Mr. Epstein is having second thoughts about doing\njail time. I would like to send Jay Lefkouitz an e-mail stating that\nif we do not have a signed agreement by tomorrou at 5:oo,\nnegotiations will end.

When [Epstein] gets out, he has to plead to state\noffenses, including against minor, registrable, and then take one year house arrest/community\nconfinement.” By reply email, Villafafia asked Lourie to call her, but there is no record of whether\nthey spoke.\n\nF. Defense Counsel Offers New Proposals Substantially Changing the Terms of\n\nthe Federal Plea Agreement, which the USAO Rejects\n\nApproximately an hour after Lourie’s email reporting the deal he had reached with\nLefkouitz, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a revised draft plea agreement. Despite the agreement Lourie\nbelieved he and Lefkouitz had reached that morning, Lefkouitz’s proposal would have resulted\nin a l6-month federal sentence folloued by 8 months of supervised release served in the form of\nhome detention. Lefkouitz also inserted a statement in his proposal explicitly prohibiting the\nUSAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration authorities to institute immigration\nproceedings against two of Epstein’s female assistants.\n\nVillafafia circulated the defense’s proposed plea agreement to Lourie and two other\nsupervisors, and expressed frustration that the new defense version incorporated terms that were\n“completely different from what Jay just told Andy they would agree to.” Villafafia also pointed\nout that the defense “wants us to recommend an improper calculation” of the sentencing guidelines\nll8 The manager told OPR that he probably meant this as a joke because in his view the continued back-and-\nforth communications with defense counsel “was ridiculous,” and the only way to “get this deal done” might be to\nhave a direct conversation with Epstein.\n\n73\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3275\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003277.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lol of 348\nmessage, “That is fine. [The West Palm Beach manager] and I will nail everything doun, we just\nwant to get a final blessing.”\n\nNegotiations continued throughout the day on Wednesday, September l9, 2oo7, with\nVillafafia and Lefkouitz exchanging emails regarding the factual proffer for a plea and the\nscheduling of a meeting to finalize the plea agreement’s terms. During that exchange, Villafafia\nmade clear to Lefkouitz that the time for negotiating was reaching an end:\n\nI hate to have to be firm about this, but we need to wrap this up by\nMonday. I will not miss my [September 25 charging] date when this\nhas dragged on for several weeks already and then, if things fall\napart, be left in a less advantageous position than before the\nnegotiations. I have had an 82-page pros memo and 53-page\nindictment siting on the shelf since May to engage in these\nnegotiations. There has to be an ending date, and that date is\nMonday.\n\nEarly that afternoon, Lourie—who was participating in the week’s negotiations from his\nnew post at the Department in Washington, D.C.—asked Villafafia to furnish him with the last\ndraft of the plea agreement she had sent to defense counsel, and she provided him with the “l8/l2\nsplit” draft she had sent to Lefkouitz the prior afternoon. After reviewing that draft, Lourie told\nVillafafia it was a “[g]ood job” but he questioned certain provisions, including whether the\nUSAO’s agreement to suspend the investigation and hold all legal process in abeyance should be\nin the plea agreement. Villafafia told Lourie that she had added that paragraph at the “insistence”\nof the defense, and opined, “TI don’t think it hurts us.” Villafafia explained to OPR that she held\nthis view because “Alex and people above me had already made the decision that if the case was\nresolved we weren’t going to get the computer equipment.”\n\nAt 3:44 p.m. that afternoon, Lefkouitz emailed a “redline” version of the federal plea\nagreement shouing his new revisions, and noted that he was “also working on a deferred [sic]\nprosecution agreement because it may well be that we cannot reach agreement here.” The defense\nredline version required Epstein to plead guilty to a federal information charging two misdemeanor\ncounts of atempt to intentionally harass a person to prevent testimony, the pending state\nindictment charging solicitation of prostitution, and a state information charging one count of\ncoercing a person to become a prostitute, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o4 (without regard\nto age). Neither of the proposed state offenses required sexual offender registration. Epstein\nwould serve an l8-month sentence and a concurrent 6o months on probation on the state charges.\nThe redline version again deleted the provisions relating to damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and\nreplaced it with the provision requiring creation of a trust administered by the state court. It\nretained language proposed by Villafafia, providing that the plea agreement “resolves the federal\ncriminal liability of the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida\ngrouing out of any criminal conduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this\nplea agreement,” but also re-inserted the provision promising not to prosecute Epstein’s assistants\nand the statement prohibiting the USAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration\nproceedings. It also included a provision stating the government’s agreement to forgo a\npresentence investigation and a promise by the government to suspend the investigation and\nwithdraw all pending legal process.\n\n75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3277\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003279.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo3 of 348\neverything, but I really do not think that Mr. Epstein is going to engage in serious negotiations\nuntil he sees the Indictment and shous up in mag [federal magistrate judge] court.” She suggested\ncharging Epstein on a federal conspiracy charge, and if he refused to plead to that offense,\nsuperseding with additional charges and going to trial. She complained that after seven weeks of\nnegotiations, “we are just spinning our wheels.” Her proposed email to Lefkouitz detailed all of\nthe objectionable provisions in his draft, and concluded, “If you or your client insists on these,\nthere can be no plea agreement.”\n\nH. Acosta Edits the Federal Plea Agreement, and Villafana Sends a Final Version\n\nto the Defense\n\nThe next day, Thursday, September 2o, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney\nBelohlavek and informed her:\n\nOur deadline is Monday evening for a signed agreement and\narraignment in the federal system. At this time, things don’t look\npromising anyway, but I will keep you posted. In their latest draft,\nthey changed what they agreed to plead to in the state from\nsolicitation of minors for prostitution (a registrable offense) to\nforcing adults into prostitution (a non-registrable offense). We will\nnot budge on this issue, so it is looking unlikely that we will reach a\nmutually acceptable agreement. If that changes, I will let you knou.\n\nAcosta sent Lourie “[s]ome thoughts” about the USAO version of the proposed “hybrid”\nfederal plea agreement he had received from Lourie the evening before, commenting that “it seems\nvery straightforward” and “we are not changing our standard charging language” for the\ndefense.!?° Noting that the draft was prepared for his signature, Acosta told Lourie that he did not\ntypically sign plea agreements and “this should not be the first,” adding that the USAO “should\nonly go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement.” !*! Lourie forwarded the email\nto Villafafia with a transmital message simply reading, “I think Alex’s changes are all good ones.\nPlease try to incorporate his suggestions, change the signature block to your name and send as\nfinal to Jay.” Lourie also noted to Acosta and Villafafia that he believed the defense would want\nto go back to the initial offer of a state plea with a non-prosecution agreement. When Villafafia\nsent the revised plea agreement to Lefkouitz later that afternoon, she advised him that if the\ndefense wanted to return to the original offer of a state plea only, the draft NPA she had sent to\nhim on September l7, 2oo7, would control.\n\nl2o The USAO had standard federal plea agreement language, from which this “hybrid” plea agreement had\nsubstantially diverged.\n\nVl The standard procedure was for documents such as plea agreements to be signed by an AUSA under the\nname of the U.S. Atorney. In his OPR interview, Acosta further explained that wanted to give “the trial team” an\nopportunity to voice any objections because “if it’s something they don’t feel comfortable with we . . . shouldn’t go\nforward with it.”\n\n77\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3279\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003281.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo5 of 348\n\nI think Jay [Lefkouitz] will try to talk you out of a registrable\noffense. Regardless of the merits of his argument, in order to get us\ndoun in time they made us an offer that included pleading to an\noffense against a minor (encouraging a minor into prostitution) and\ntouted that we should be happy because it was registrable. For that\nreason alone, I don’t think we should consider allouing them to\ncome doun from their oun offer, either on this issue or on time of\nincarceration.\n\nLefkouitz atempted to reach Acosta that night, but Acosta directed Villafafia to return the\ncall, and told Lourie that he did not want to open ‘“‘a backchannel” with defense counsel. Lourie\ninstructed Villafafia, “U can tell [JJay that [A]lex will not agree to a nonregistration offense.”\n\nOn the morning of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Acosta informing him\nthat “it looks like we will be [filing charges against] Mr. Epstein on Tuesday,” reporting that the\ncharging package was being reviewed by the West Palm Beach manager, and asking if anyone in\nthe Miami office needed to review it. Villafafia also alerted Lourie that she had spoken that\nmorning to Lefkouitz, who “was waffling” about Epstein pleading to a state charge that required\nsexual offender registration, and she noted that she would confer with Krischer and Belohlavek\n“to make sure the defense doesn’t try to do an end run.”\n\nThat same morning, Epstein atorney Sanchez, who had not been involved in negotiations\nfor several weeks, emailed Sloman, advising, “[I] want to finalize the plea deal and there is only\none issue outstanding and [I] do not believe that [A]lex has read all the defense submissions that\nwould assist in his determination on this point . . . [U]pon resolution, we will be prepared to sign\nas soon as today.” From his out-of-toun vacation, Sloman forwarded the email to Acosta, who\nreplied, “Enjo[y] vacation. Working with [M]arie on this.” Sloman also forwarded Sanchez’s\nemail to Lourie and asked, “Do you knou what she’s talking about?” Lourie responded that\nSanchez “has not been in any negotiations. Don’t even engage with yet another cook.”\n\nJ. The USAO Agrees Not to Criminally Charge “Potential Co-Conspirators”\n\nLefkouitz, in the meantime, sent Villafafia a revised draft NPA that proposed an l8-month\nsentence in the county jail, folloued by l2 months of community control, and restored the\nprovision for a trust fund for disbursement to an agreed-upon list of individuals “who seek\nreimbursement by filing suit pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 2255.” This defense draft retained the\nprovision promising not to criminally charge Epstein’s four female assistants and unnamed\nemployees of the specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity, but also extended the provision to “any\npotential co-conspirators” for any criminal charge arising from the ongoing federal investigation.\nThis language had evolved from similar language that Villafafia had included in the USAO’s\nearlier proposed draft federal plea agreement.!?? Lefkouitz also again included the sentence\nl22 The language in the USAO’s draft federal plea agreement stated, “This agreement resolves the federal\ncriminal liability of the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any\ncriminal conduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO]... .”\n\n79\nDOJ-OGR- oooo328l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003282.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo6 of 348\nprecluding the government from requesting, initiating, or recommending immigration proceedings\nagainst the two assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAt this point, Lefkouitz again sought to speak to Acosta, who replied by email: “I am\nhappy to talk. My caveat is that in the middle of negotiations, u try to avoid[] undermining my\nstaff by allouing ‘interlocutor[]y’ appeals so to speak so I’d want [M]arie on the call[.] I'll have\nher set something up.”\n\nVillafafia sent to Lefkouitz her oun revised NPA, telling him it was her “atempt at\ncombining our thoughts,” but it had not “been approved by the office yet.” She inserted solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, a registrable offense, as the charge to which Epstein would\nplead guilty; proposed a joint recommendation for a 3o-month sentence, divided into l8 months\nin the county jail and l2 months of community control; and amended the § 2255 provision.!”3\nVillafafia’s revision retained the provision suspending the investigation and holding all legal\nprocess in abeyance, and she incorporated the non-prosecution provision while slightly altering it\nto apply to “any potential co-conspirator of Epstein, including” the four named assistants, and\ndeleting mention of the corporate entity employees. Finally, Villafafia deleted mention of\nimmigration proceedings, but advised in her transmital email that “we have not and don’t plan to\nask immigration” proceedings to be initiated. !*4\n\nLater that day, Villafafia alerted Lourie (who had arrived in Florida from Washington, D.C.\nearly that afternoon) and the new West Palm Beach manager (copying her first-line supervisor and\nco-counsel) that she had included language that defense counsel had requested “regarding\npromises not to prosecute other people,” and commented, “I don’t think it hurts us.” There is no\ndocumentation that Lourie, the West Palm Beach manager, or anyone else expressed disagreement\nwith Villafafia’s assessment. Rather, within a few minutes, Villafafia re-sent her email, adding\nthat defense counsel was persisting in including an immigration waiver in the agreement, to which\nLourie responded, “No way. We don’t put that sort of thing in a plea agreement.” Villafafia replied\nto Lourie, indicating she would pass that along to defense counsel and adding, “Any other\nthoughts?” When Lourie gave no further response, Villafafia informed defense counsel that Lourie\nhad rejected the proposed immigration language.\n\nOPR questioned the subjects about the USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Lourie did not recall why the USAO agreed to it, but he speculated that he left\nthat provision in the NPA because he believed at the time that it benefited the government in some\nway. In particular, Lourie conjectured that the promise not to prosecute “any potential\nco-conspirators” protected victims who had recruited others and thus potentially were\nco-conspirators in Epstein’s scheme. Lourie also told OPR, “I bet the answer was that we weren’t\ngoing to charge” Epstein’s accomplices, because Acosta “didn’t really want to charge Epstein” in\nl23 Villafafia noted that she had consulted with a USAO employee who was a “former corporate counsel from a\nhospital” about the § 2255 language, and thought that the revised language “addresses the concern about having an\nunlimited number of claimed victims, without me trying to bind girls who I do not represent.”\n\nl4 Villafafia gave OPR an explanation similar to that given by the case agents—that an ICE Special Agent had.\nbeen involved in the early stages of the federal investigation of Epstein, and Villafafia believed the agent knew two of\nEpstein’s female assistants were foreign nationals and would have acted appropriately on that information. Villafafia\nalso said that the USAO generally did not get involved in immigration issues.\n8o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3282\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003288.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll2 of 348\nit had identified as victims.'°!

Epstein Further Delays His Guilty Plea\n\nThe addendum did not bring the case to conclusion. Instead, the mater entered a new,\nprotracted phase, which involved the upper echelons of the Department of Justice. Despite the\nfact that Epstein and his atorneys had signed the NPA, they pursued a new strategy of appealing\nto senior Department managers with the goal of seting aside the NPA entirely. Although\nultimately unsuccessful, the strategy delayed the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea by months.\n\nOn October 29, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, raising several issues that she wanted\nSloman to address with Lefkouitz. Among other things, Villafafia pointed out that the NPA\nrequired Epstein to use his “best efforts” to comply with the agreement, but he had failed to comply\nwith the timeline established by the NPA when he sought and obtained a plea hearing\npostponement from October 26 to November 2o. Responding to Lefkouitz’s atempts to limit the\nUSAO’s communications with various entities and individuals, Villafafia noted that the USAO\nneeded to be able to communicate with the State Atorney’s Office and the victims’ atorney “to\n[e]nsure that Epstein is abiding by the terms of the agreement.”\n\nThat same day, <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney Belohlavek informed Sloman that the state judge\nassigned to the case had scheduled Epstein’s plea and sentence in early January 2oo8. Belohlavek\nassured Sloman that the “plea and sentence will definitely occur before the January 4th date that\nwas agreed on by all for the sentencing.”'“” Nonetheless, emails over the course of the next month\nshou that the USAO, the State Atorney’s Office, and defense counsel continued to communicate\nregarding the date of the guilty plea, with the USAO asserting that a proposed January 7, 2oo8\ndate for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea was “unacceptable,” while the defense contended that\nEpstein had not agreed to any date. Finally, after multiple communications referring to various\npotential dates, on December 7, 2oo7, Epstein atorney Jack Goldberger issued a Notice of\nHearing, seting the case for January 4, 2oo8.!°°\n\nE. Epstein Seeks Departmental Review of the NPA’s § 2255 Provision Relating to\n\nMonetary Damages for the Victims\n\nWith Epstein’s plea hearing delayed, he launched a new effort to undermine the validity of\nthe NPA, this time within the Department. On November l6, 2oo7, Epstein atorney Kenneth Starr\ncalled the office of <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General for the Criminal Division Alice Fisher and left a\nmessage that he was calling regarding Epstein.'*! At Fisher’s request, Lourie, who in late\nSeptember 2oo7 had begun serving his detail as Fisher’s Principal Deputy and Chief of Staff,\nreturned the call.

'*”\n\nOn November 28, 2oo7, Starr requested, by leter, a meeting with Fisher. In his leter, Starr\nargued that the USAO improperly had compelled Epstein to agree to pay civil damages under\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 as part of a state-based resolution of a criminal case. On the same day, Lefkouitz\nemailed Sloman, complaining about the USAO’s plan to notify victims about the § 2255 provision\nand alerting Sloman that Epstein’s counsel were seeking a meeting with the <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney\nGeneral “to address what we believe is the unprecedented nature of the section 2255 component”\nof the NPA. After Lourie sent to Sloman a copy of the Starr leter, Sloman forwarded it to\nVillafafia, asking her to prepare a chronology of the plea negotiations and hou the § 2255 provision\nevolved. Villafafia responded that she was “going through all of the ways in which they have tried\nto breach the agreement to convince you guys to let me indict.”\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Lourie consulted with CEOS Chief Oosterban, asking for his\nthoughts on defense counsel’s arguments. At the same time, at Lourie’s request, Villafafia sent\nthe NPA and its addendum to Lourie and Oosterban. Oosterban responded to Lourie that he was\n“not thrilled” about the NPA; described Epstein’s conduct as unusually “egregious,” particularly\nbecause of its serial nature; and observed that the NPA was “prety advantageous for the defendant\nand not all that helpful to the victims.” He opined, houever, that the <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General\nwould not and should not consider or address the NPA “other than to say that she agrees with it.”\nDuring her OPR interview, Fisher did not recall reading Starr’s leter or discussing it with\nOosterban, but believed the comment about her “agree[ing] with it” referred to a federal\nprosecution of Epstein, which she believed was appropriate. She told OPR, houever, that she\n“played no role in” the NPA and did not review or approve the agreement either before or after it\nwas signed.\n\nAs set forth in more detail in Chapter Three of this Report, Villafafia planned to notify the\nvictims about the NPA and its § 2255 provision, as well as about the state plea hearing, and she\nprovided a draft of the notification leter to Lefkouitz for comments. On November 29, 2oo7,\nLefkouitz sent Acosta a leter complaining about the draft notification to the victims. Lefkouitz\nasked the USAO to refrain from notifying the victims until after defense counsel met with <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span>\nAtorney General Fisher, which he anticipated would take place the follouing week. Internal\nemails indicate that Lourie contacted Oosterban about his availability for a meeting with Starr,\nbut both Fisher and Lourie told OPR that such a meeting never took place, and OPR found no\nevidence that it did.\n\nAcosta promptly responded to Lefkouitz by leter, directing him to raise his concerns about\nvictim notification with Villafafia or Sloman. Acosta also addressed Epstein’s evident efforts to\nstop the NPA from being enforced:\n\nl52 In a short email to Fisher, the next day, Lourie reported simply: “He was very nice.

No more;\nno less.” Acosta documented the USAO’s understanding of the operation of the NPA’s § 2255\nl53 The USAO may have been asked to respond because Starr’s leter raised issues that had not been previously\nraised with the USAO, and it would normally fall to the USAO to address them in the first instance.\n\n96\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3298\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003301.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l25 of 348\n\nNotwithstanding these voluminous submissions, Lefkouitz added that Epstein\n“unconditionally re-asserts his intention to fulfill and not seek to withdraw from or unwind” the\nNPA.\n\n2. As a Result of the Starr and Lefkouitz Submissions, the New USAO\nCriminal Chief Begins a Full Review of the Evidence, and Acosta\nAgrees to Meet Again with Defense Counsel\n\nAfter reviewing Starr’s and Lefkouitz’s leters, Sloman notified Villafafia that “in light of\nthe recent Kirkland & Ellis correspondence” he had asked Robert Senior, who had succeeded\nMenchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, to review de novo the evidence underlying\nthe proposed revised indictment, and Sloman asked Villafafia to provide Senior with all the state\nand FBI investigative materials.\n\nIn the meantime, Acosta agreed to meet with Starr and other Epstein defense atorneys to\ndiscuss the defense complaints raised in Lefkouitz’s December ll, 2oo7 submissions.'°° The\nmeeting took place in Miami on December l4, 2oo7. The defense team included Starr,\nDershouitz, Lefcourt, and Boston atorney Martin Weinberg. The USAO side included Acosta,\nSloman, Villafafia, and another senior AUSA, with the Miami FBI Special Agent in Charge and\n<span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Special Agent in Charge also present. In addition to previously raised arguments, during\nthis meeting, Epstein’s atorneys raised a new argument—that the state charge to which Epstein\nhad agreed to plead guilty did not apply to the facts of the case.\n\n3. The Defense Notifies Acosta That It May Pursue a Department Review\nof the USAO’s Actions\n\nShortly after the December l4, 2oo7 meeting, Lefkouitz notified Acosta that if the issues\nraised at the meeting could not be resolved promptly, the defense team may “have no alternative\nbut to seek review in Washington.” Acosta notified <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General Fisher that the\ndefense team might make an appeal to her, and he asked her to grant such a request for review and\n“to in fact review this case in an expedited manner [in order] to preserve the January 4th plea date.”\nStarr and Lefkouitz then sent to Acosta a lengthy leter, with numerous previously submited\ndefense submissions, reviewing issues discussed at the meeting, and advising that Epstein sought\na “prompt, independent, expedited review” of the evidence by “you or someone you trust.” The\nleter reiterated Epstein’s position that his conduct did not amount to a registrable offense under\nstate law or a violation of federal law, and with respect to the NPA’s § 2255 provision, that it was\n“improper” to require Epstein to pay damages “‘to individuals who do nothing but simply assert a\nclaim” under the statute.\n\nl56 As <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General Fisher’s Chief of Staff, Lourie had informed Starr that Fisher hoped Starr\nwould speak to Acosta to “resolve the[] fairly narrou issues” raised in Starr’s correspondence with Acosta.

Acosta Atempts to Revise the NPA § 2255 Language concerning\nMonetary Damages, but the Defense Does Not Accept It\nAcosta undertook to respond to defense counsel’s continuing concern about the § 2255\nprovision. He sent to Deputy <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General Sigal Mandelker language that he\nproposed including in a revision to the NPA’s § 2255 implementation section. Mandelker\nforwarded the language to her counterpart in the Civil Division, who responded to Mandelker and\nAcosta that he did not have “any insight” to offer. On December l9, 2oo7, after Acosta and\nSloman had a phone conversation with Starr and Lefkouitz, Acosta sent to Sanchez a leter\nproposing to resolve “our disagreements over interpretation[]” by replacing the existing language\nof the NPA relating to § 2255 with a provision that would read:\nAny person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an\noffense enumerated in Title l8, United States Code, Section 2255,\nwill have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she\nwould have had, if Mr. Epstein [had] been tried federally and\nconvicted of an enumerated offense.

Any\njudicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority\ndetermining which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet,\nshall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these\nidentified victims in the same position as they would have been had\nMr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.\n\nAcosta also noted that he had resisted his prosecutors’ urging to declare the NPA breached by the\n\ndefense delays. !°’\n\nLefkouitz responded by leter a few days later, suggesting that Acosta’s proposal raised\n“several troubling questions” and that “the problem arises from the incongruity that exists when\natempting to fit a federal civil remedies statute into a criminal plea agreement.” °* In a follou-up\nleter to Acosta, to address the USAO’s concern that Epstein was intentionally delaying the entry\nof his guilty plea, Lefkouitz asserted that “any impediment to the resolution at issue is a direct\ncause of the disagreements between the parties,” and that defense counsel had “at all times made\nand will continue to make sincere efforts to resolve and finalize issues as expeditiously as\npossible.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that despite this assurance from defense counsel, he was “increasingly\nfrustrated” by Epstein’s desire to take an “llth hour appeal” to the Department so soon before the\nl57 As described in detail in Chapter Three, Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter also addressed defense objections\nto notifying the victims about the NPA and the state plea.\n\nl58 After Starr and Lefkouitz had another conversation with Acosta and Sloman, Lefkouitz sent a second leter\nto Acosta reiterating concerns with the § 2255 provision and asserting that the provision was “inherently flawed and\nbecoming truly unmanageable.” In the end, the defense team rejected Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 NPA modification\nleter.\nloo\nDOJ-OGR- oooo33o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003303.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l27 of 348\nscheduled January 4, 2oo8 plea hearing. As soon became apparent, Acosta was unable to achieve\nan expedited review so that Epstein could plead guilty and be sentenced by\nJanuary 4, 2oo8, and the plea and sentencing date was rescheduled. On January 2, 2oo8, Sloman\nspoke with <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney Belohlavek, who confirmed that the change of plea hearing\nhad been postponed. In an email reporting this to Acosta and Villafafia, Sloman said that Epstein’s\nlocal defense atorney Goldberger had told Belohlavek the postponement was because the facts\n“did not fit the proposed state charge,” and that Belohlavek told Sloman she agreed with that\nassessment.’ The next day, Villafafia sent to Acosta and Sloman a local newspaper article\nreporting that Epstein’s state plea hearing was reset for March and in exchange for it the federal\nauthorities would drop their investigation of him. Acosta also sent to Sloman and Villafafia an\nemail memorializing a statement made to him by Lefkouitz in a phone call that day: “‘I\n[Lefkouitz] may have made a mistake 6 months ago. [Belohlavek] told us solicitation [is] not\nregistrable. It turns out that the actual offense charged is.’”!®°\n\n5. January 7, 2oo8: Acosta and Sloman Meet with Sanchez, Who Makes\nAdditional Allegations of USAO Misconduct\n\nOn January 7, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman met with defense atorney Sanchez at her request.\nAccording to meeting notes made by Sloman, among other things, Sanchez alleged that the\nUSAO’s media spokesperson had improperly disclosed details of the Epstein case to a national\nnews reporter, and Sanchez “suggested that the USAO could avoid any potential ugliness in DC\nby agreeing to a watered-doun resolution for Epstein.” After Acosta excused himself to atend\nanother meeting and Sloman refused to speak further with Sanchez “without a witness present,”\nshe left. Later that day, Acosta and Sloman spoke by phone with Starr, Lefkouitz, and Sanchez,\nwho expressed concern about the “leak” to the news media, reiterated their objections to the NPA,\nand pressed for the “‘watered-doun resolution,” which they specified would mean allouing Epstein\nto plead to a charge of coercion instead of procurement, avoid serving time in jail, and not register\nas a sexual offender. A note in the margin of Sloman’s handwriten notes of the conversation\nreads: “We’re back to where we started in September.”\n\nThat evening, Villafafia expressed concern that the delay in resolving the mater was\naffecting the USAO’s ability to go forward with a prosecution should Epstein renege on his\nagreement, and she outlined for Acosta and Sloman the steps she proposed to take while Epstein\nwas pursuing Departmental review. Those steps included re-establishing contact with victims,\ninterviewing victims in New York and one victim who lived in a foreign country, making contact\nwith “potential sources of information” in the Virgin Islands, and re-initiating proceedings to\nobtain Epstein’s computers.\n\nIn the meantime, USAO Criminal Division Chief Robert Senior performed a “soup to nuts”\nreview of the Epstein investigation, reviewing the indictment package and all of the evidence\nVillafafia had compiled. He told OPR that he could not recall the reason for his review, but opined\nl5?

Sloman emailed Lefkouitz that CEOS was\n“ready to proceed immediately” with a review of the mater. Sloman advised Lefkouitz that “in\nthe event CEOS decides that a federal prosecution should not be undertaken against Mr. Epstein,\nthis Office will close its investigation,” but that, “should CEOS disagree with Mr. Epstein’s\nposition, Mr. Epstein shall have one week to abide by [the NPA].” Sloman forwarded this email\nto Villafafia, who responded, “Why would we possibly let him keep the same deal after all he has\nput us through? And after we have discovered 6 new girls... .”\n\nThe defense soon signaled that the CEOS review would not end Epstein’s requests for the\nDepartment’s involvement. On February 29, 2oo8, Lefkouitz requested a defense meeting with\nOosterban on March l2, 2oo8.'% Starr spoke to <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General Fisher and “made it\nclear that [the defense team would] want an audience with her if [CEOS] decid[ed] to support the\nprosecution.” On March 6, 2oo8, Acosta alerted Sloman and Oosterban that Starr and Lefkouitz\nhad called him to express “concern” about Oosterban’s participation in the case, and indicated\nthat “they may ask for more senior involvement.” Acosta “informed them that they certainly had\nthe right to ask whomever they wanted for whatever they thought appropriate, and that whatever\nprocess would be given them was up to whomever they asked.”\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz folloued up with Acosta in an email:\n\nWe appreciate that you will afford us as much time as Main Justice\n\ndetermines is appropriate for it to conduct a review of this mater.\n\nAs you have suggested, we will initiate that review process with\n\nDrew Oosterban, and engage in a discussion with him about all of\n\nthe facts and circumstances, as well as the legal and policy issues\n\nassociated with this case... .

'®\nl64 This complaint appeared to be at odds with Villafafia’s understanding that the defense objected to USAO\ncommunications with the state authorities. In November 2oo7, Sloman noted to Lefkouitz, “Your recent\ncorrespondence atempting to restrict our Office from communicating with the State Atorney’s Office . . . raises\nconcern.” In a March 2oo8 email reporting to CEOS about the state case, Villafafia noted that she did not knou\nwhether a state “misdemeanor deal [was] back on the table because the defense demanded that we have no contact\nwith the State Atorney’s Office, so I haven’t spoken with the [<span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney] in over 6 months.” Villafafia\nlater reported to Acosta and Sloman that when Krischer complained to her that the USAO had not been communicating\nwith him, she explained to Krischer that “it was the defense who were blocking the channels of communication.”\n\nl65 In approximately 2ool, Sloman briefly left the USAO and for a few months was in private practice with a\nMiami atorney, whose practice specialized in plaintiffs’ sexual abuse claims.

Finally, in a leter to <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General Fisher on\nMay l4, 2oo8, Starr thanked her for having spoken with him the previous day, reiterated the\ndefense team’s various complaints, and asked her to meet with him, Lefkouitz, and Whitley.\n\nMeanwhile, Oosterban’s Deputy Chief drafted a decision leter to be sent from Oosterban\nto Lefkouitz, and over the course of several weeks, it was reviewed by and received input from\nDeputy <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General Mandelker and <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General Fisher, as well as\nthe Criminal Division’s Appellate Section (regarding certain legal issues) and Office of\nEnforcement Operations (regarding the Petite policy).

The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\ndiscretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.””’ Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel application” of relevant federal statutes;'°° (2) CEOS’s conclusion that\nfederal prosecution would not be “an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an endorsement” of the\ncase;!®” (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims. The Epstein defense team alleged in the leter that Sloman’s past association with the\natorney caused Sloman to take actions to favor victims’ potential civil lawsuits against Epstein.\n\nl66 Oosterban’s leter stated, “Mr. Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution\neven though it might involve a novel application of a federal statute.” This statement referred to a defense argument\nbased on a prior Departmental expression of concern about a Congressional proposal to expand federal law to “adult\nprostitution where no force, fraud or coercion was used.” Oosterban stated that “the Department’s efforts are properly\nfocused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children”—even if wholly local—and “the exploitation of adults\nthrough force, fraud, or coercion.” He then observed that the fact “that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look\nprecisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive.”\n\nl67 Oosterban began his leter, houever, by making it clear that CEOS had considered “the narrou question as\nto whether there is a legitimate basis for the U.S. Atorney’s Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of\nMr. Epstein.”\n\nlo7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003313.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l37 of 348\n\nThe next day, Villafafia asked Goldberger to change the plea agreement by inserting the\nword “imprisoned” after “6 months,” and Goldberger agreed to do so.

As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the\nchoice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as\nincompetence, corruption, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may\nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a conviction, if the prior\nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a\nsubstantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and restitution as well as\nimprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal\nprosecution.”\n\n(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal\noffense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and\nsustain a conviction.\n\nHouever, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a\nfederal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed\nprosecution.\n\nThe Petite policy cautions that whenever a mater involves overlapping federal and state\njurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most\nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests\ninvolved.” If a substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular\nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the mater to the appropriate <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General\nfor resolution. Prior approval from the appropriate <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General must be obtained\nbefore bringing a prosecution governed by this policy.\n\n3. USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve an investigation or pending case through a\nplea agreement. USAM §§ 9-27.33o; 9-27.4oo. Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned\nby Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).!°3 Regardless of whether the plea agreement is\noffered pre-charge or post-charge, the prosecutor’s plea bargaining “must honestly reflect the\ntotality and seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.” USAM § 9-27.4oo, comment.!°* The\nimportance of selecting a charge that reflects the seriousness of the conduct is echoed in USAM\n§ 9-27.43o, which directs the prosecutor to require a defendant to plead to an offense that\nrepresents the most serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the\nl28 As previously noted, Rule ll(c)(l)(C) permits the parties to agree to resolve the case in exchange for a\nspecific sentence, subject to the court’s acceptance of the agreement.\n\nl94 See also USAM § 9-27.3oo (“Once the decision to prosecute has been made, the atorney for the government\nshould charge . . . the most serious offense that is consistent with the nature of the defendant’s conduct, and that is\nlikely to result in a sustainable conviction.”).\nl23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3325\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003327.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5l of 348\ncooperation as part of a plea agreement, or compelling cooperation under a “use immunity” order.\nThe comment observes that these alternative means “are clearly preferable to permiting an\noffender to avoid any liability for his/her conduct” and “should be given serious consideration in\nthe first instance.” USAM 8§ 9-27.62o and 9-27.63o set forth considerations a prosecutor should\ntake into account when entering into a non-prosecution agreement. Generally, the U.S. Atorney\nhas authority to approve a non-prosecution agreement. USAM § 9-27.6oo comment. Houever,\nUSAM § 9-27.64o directs that a government atorney should not enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation without first obtaining the approval of the\nappropriate <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General, or his or her designee, when the person is someone who\n“is likely to become of major public interest.”\n\nThese USAM provisions do not address the uses of non-prosecution agreements in\ncircumstances other than when needed to obtain cooperation.\n5. USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity\nNothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure\nof third parties in negotiating with a criminal defendant. Instead, the provision that addresses\nimmunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has\nasserted a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. See USAM §§ 9-23.loo ef seq.\n6. USAM/C.E.R. Provisions Relating to Financial Conflicts of Interest\nDepartment employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related\nlaws, rules, regulations, and policies. See, generally, USAM § l-4.ooo et seg. Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a financial interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the\nintegrity of the Department’s programs and operations. The determination must be made in\nwriting. See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.5ol-5o2.\nB. Other Department Policies\nl. Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the responsibility for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As applicable here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo). The Ashcroft Memo, which explicitly superseded all previous\nDepartmental guidance on the subject, set forth policies “designed to ensure that all federal\nl25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3327\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003328.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l52 of 348\nprosecutors adhere to the principles and objectives” of the Sentencing Reform Act of l984, the\nSentencing Guidelines, and the PROTECT Act “in their charging, case disposition, and sentencing\npractices.” !?>\n\nThe Ashcroft Memo directed that, “in all federal cases, federal prosecutors must charge\nand pursue the most serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts of\nthe case,” except as authorized by an <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or designated\nsupervisory authority in certain articulated limited circumstances. The Ashcroft Memo cautioned\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“particularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy. In\naddition, the policy applies to “readily provable” charges, thus inherently allouing a prosecutor\nl95 The Ashcroft Memo was issued before the Supreme Court decided United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 22o\n(2oo5), which struck doun the provision of the federal sentencing statute that required federal district judges to impose\na sentence within the applicable Federal Sentencing Guidelines range. Those Guidelines were the product of\nthe United States Sentencing Commission, which was created by the Sentencing Reform Act of l984. The\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2oo3, Pub.\nL. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, was directed at preventing child abuse. It included a variety of provisions designed to\nimprove the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against children. Among other things, the PROTECT Act\nprovided for specific sentencing considerations for certain sex-related offenses, such as those involving multiple\noccasions of prohibited sexual conduct or those involving material with depictions of violence or with specified\nnumbers of images.\n\nl26\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3328\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003338.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l62 of 348\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was\nmotivated by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the\nUSAM to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate. As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” /d. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment).”°° The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3338\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003339.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l63 of 348\nagreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\n\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\n\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.”\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §8§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o6 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3339\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003340.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l64 of 348\nLongstanding Department policy directs prosecutors to require the defendant to plead to the most\nserious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the defendant’s criminal\nconduct, that has an adequate factual basis, is likely to result in a sustainable conviction, makes\nlikely the imposition of an appropriate sentence and restitution order, and does not adversely affect\nthe investigation or prosecution of others. See USAM §§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.7°? Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o8 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\nCircumstances,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional circumstances with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General, United States Atorney, or designated\n\nsupervisory atorney. This exception recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system. For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office.

The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafatia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA of a broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3342\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003349.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l73 of 348\nd[id]n’t want to have to relive what happened to them.””!” The co-case agent told OPR that one\nof the “strategies” for dealing with the victims’ fear was “to keep them off the stand,” and he\ngenerally remembered discussions about resolving the Epstein case in a way that protected the\nvictims’ identities. In addition, the CEOS Trial Atorney who briefly worked with Villafafia on\nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she\nformed the impression that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS\nTrial Atorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,” but would have required an\nextensive amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about\npotentially being labeled as prostitutes. The CEOS Trial Atorney also told OPR that “there were\nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.7!®\n\nThe contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal\nand factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,\nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafafia’s proposed charges were whether the USAO\ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some\nminor victims had told Epstein they were l8. He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there\nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is\nuncharted territory to some degree.” In his July 5, 2oo7 email to Villafafia, Menchel cited Acosta’s\nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal\nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe Childhood.” Defense counsel raised\nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous leters to the USAO. Defense submissions\natacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have\nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of\nvictim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and\npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages.\n\nAcosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial\nissues,” his oun focus had been on “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure as\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had\nbeen involved in efforts to address sex trafficking. He told OPR that one of the “background\nissues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his leadership, and which influenced his\nview of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of\nprostitution. Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable\nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a mater\nof state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in\n2oo7.7\noh In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2oo7, when he located a\nvictim living outside of the United States, she claimed only to “knou Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved\naway to distance herself from this situation,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”\n\n2l8 In April 2oo7, a victim who was represented by an atorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded\ninterview with the FBI, with her atorney and his investigator present. This victim denied being involved in, or being\na victim of, criminal activity. Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”\n2l9 In his March 2o, 2oll leter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast,\nAcosta described “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.” Most\nof the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved\nl47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3349\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003355.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l79 of 348\n\nIn its review of the documentary record, OPR examined an email writen by Villafafia in\n2ol8, more than a decade after the NPA was negotiated, in which she suggested that the two-year\nsentence requirement in the initial “term sheet” provided to the defense was developed by Menchel\nas a favor to defense atorney Sanchez. OPR examined the facts surrounding this allegation and\ndetermined that there was no merit to it. Specifically, in December 2ol8, after the Miami Herald\ninvestigative report renewed public atention to the case, Villafafia recounted in an email to a\nsupervisory AUSA, a conversation she recalled having had with Sloman about the case.””° In the\nemail, Villafafia stated that she had not been a participant in discussions that led to Acosta’s\ndecision to offer a two-year plea deal, but she added the follouing: “Months (or possibly years)\nlater, I asked former First <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Jeff Sloman where the two-year figure came from. He said\nthat Lily [sic] Ann Sanchez (atorney for Epstein) asked Mr. Menchel to ‘do her a solid’ and\nconvince Mr. Acosta to offer two years.”\n\nOPR questioned both Villafafia and Sloman about the purported “do her a solid” remark.\nVillafafia told OPR that she had been aware that Menchel and Sanchez were friends. During her\nOPR interview, Villafafia explained:\n\n[A] lot later, I asked Jeff. I said, you knou, “Jeff, where did this two\nyears come from?” And he said, “Well, I always figured that. . .\nLilly asked Mat to do her a solid,” which I thought was such a\nstrange term, .. . “and to get her a good deal so that she would be in\nEpstein’s good graces” and that that’s where the two years came\nfrom. Although strangely enough, then several years after that, Jeff\nSloman asked me where the two years came from, and I had to\nremind him of that conversation. So Jeff doesn’t knou where the\ntwo years came from.\n\nBecause the email had been expressed in more definitive terms, OPR asked Villafafia\nwhether Sloman had affirmatively asserted that the two-year deal was a favor from Menchel to\ndefense counsel, or whether he had stated that he merely “figured” that was the case, but Villafafia\ncould not recall precisely what Sloman had said. At a follou-up interview, Villafafia again said\nthat she was unable to recall whether Sloman’s specific statement was “Lilly asked Mat to do her\na solid, and he did it,” or “I always figured Mat just wanted... to do her a solid.” Villafafia stated\nthat she was unaware of any information that “expressly [indicated] that there was any sort of\nexchange of. . . a favor in either direction.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall making such a remark, although he could\nnot rule out the possibility that Villafafia, for whom he repeatedly expressed great respect, “heard\nthat in some fashion.” He told OPR that ifhe did say something to Villafafia about Menchel having\ndone “a solid” for Epstein’s counsel, he could not have meant it seriously, and he explained, “[I]t’s\nnot something that I would have believed. Him doing her a solid. I mean that’s the furthest thing\nfrom my recollection or impression even after years later.”\n\n225 Villafafia’s email stemmed from a congressional inquiry recetved by the Department concerning the Epstein\ninvestigation and the NPA, to which the USAO had been asked to assist in responding. In her email, Villafafia\naddressed several issues that she perceived to be the “three main questions” raised by the press coverage.\nl53\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3355\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003361.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l85 of 348\n\nThe meeting of USAO representatives and Epstein’s defense atorneys, together with the\nState Atorney and the lead state prosecutor on September l2, 2oo7, was a necessary part of the\nNPA negotiation process.\n\nEven after the NPA was signed, the defense continued to request meetings and reviews of\nthe case, both within the USAO and by the Department’s Criminal Division and the Deputy\nAtorney General. Although limited reviews were granted, during this period there was only one\nsubstantive meeting with Acosta, on December l4, 2oo7.7? This meeting occurred in lieu of the\nmeeting Starr had requested of <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General Fisher, most likely because the defense\nsubmissions to the Department’s Criminal Division had raised issues not previously raised with\nthe USAO and the Department determined that Acosta should address those in the first instance.\nAcosta told OPR that he did not ask for the Department review, but he also did not want to appear\nas if he “fear[ed]” that review. Acosta’s nuanced position, houever, was not clear to the\nDepartment atorneys who responded to Epstein’s appeals and who perceived Acosta to be in favor\nof a Department review, rather than merely tolerant of it. Notably, though, none of those meetings\nor reviews resulted in the USAO abandoning the NPA, and Epstein gained no substantial\nadvantage from his continued entreaties.\n\nIn sum, in evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered the number of meetings, their\npurpose, the content of the discussions, and decisions made afterwards. OPR cannot say that the\nnumber of meetings, particularly those occurring before the NPA was signed, was so far outside\nthe norm—for a high profile case with skilled defense atorneys—that the quantity of meetings\nalone shous that the subjects were motivated by improper favoritism. In evaluating the subjects’\nconduct, OPR considered that the meetings were held with different levels of USAO managers and\nthat the explanations for the decisions to participate in the meetings reflected reasonable strategic\ngoals. Although OPR cannot rule out the possibility that because Acosta, Menchel, Lourie, or\nSloman knew or knew of the defense atorneys, they may have been willing to meet with them, it\nis also true that prosecutors routinely meet with defense atorneys, including those who are knoun\nto them and those who are not. Furthermore, meetings are more likely to occur in high profile\ncases involving defendants with the financial resources to hire skilled defense counsel who request\nmeetings at the highest levels of the USAO and the Department. Most significantly, OPR did not\nfind evidence supporting a conclusion that the meetings themselves resulted in any substantial\nbenefit to the defense. At each meeting, defense counsel strongly pressed the USAO—on factual,\nlegal, and policy grounds—to forgo its federal investigation and to return the mater to the state to\nproceed as it saw fit. The USAO never yielded on that point. Accordingly, OPR did not find\nevidence supporting a conclusion that Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia met with\ndefense counsel for the purpose of benefiting Epstein or that the meetings themselves caused\nAcosta or the other subjects to provide improper benefits to Epstein.\n\n282, Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz is discussed separately in the follouing section.\n233 Starr and other defense atorneys only obtained one meeting at the Department level, with Deputy <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span>\nAtorney General Mandelker and CEOS Chief Oosterban in March 2oo8. Although Starr requested a meeting with\n<span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General Fisher and another with Deputy Atorney General Filip, those requests were not granted.\nl59\nDOJ-OGR- oooo336l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003366.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9o of 348\n\nOPR asked Villafafia about these emails and about the tenor of her interactions with\nLefkouitz during the NPA negotiations and with other defense atorneys generally. Villafafia\nacknouledged that their tone was collegial and collaborative, and explained that generally, the\ntone of these emails reflected her personality and her commitment to complete the task her\nsupervisors had assigned to her:\n\n[I|f you were to pull all my e-mails on every case, you would find\nthat that is hou I communicate with people. I’m a Minnesota girl,\nand I prefer not to be confrontational until I have to be. And I can\nbe when I need to be. But my instructions from my supervisors were\nto engage in these negotiations and to complete them. So I felt that\ngiven that task, the best way to complete them was to reach the\nagreement and, keeping in mind the terms that . . . our office had\nagreed to, and do that in a way that is civil. So... although my\nlanguage in the kind of introductory or prefatory communications\nwith Mr. Lefkouitz was casual and was friendly, when you look at\nthe terms and when he would come back to me asking for changes,\nmy response was always, “No, I will not make that change.”\n\nVillafafia denied any intention to keep the victims uninformed about the NPA or to provide\nan improper benefit for Epstein, and she explained the context of the emails in question. The email\nin which Villafafia expressed reluctance to “highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and all\nof the other persons that we could charge” was writen in response to a defense proposal to include\nin the federal plea agreement the parties were then considering a promise by the government not\nto prosecute Epstein’s assistants and other employees. Lefkouitz had proposed that the plea\nagreement state, “Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also precludes the\ninitiation of any and all criminal charges which might otherwise in the future be brought against\n[four named female assistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity] for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” Villafafia told OPR that\nthe USAO was not intending to charge Epstein’s assistants and was not aware of anyone else who\ncould be charged, and thus did not oppose the request not to prosecute third parties. Houever,\nVillafafia was concerned that an overly detailed federal plea agreement would prompt the court to\nrequire the government to provide further information about the uncharged conduct, which might\nlead Epstein to claim the government breached the agreement by providing information to the\ncourt not directly connected to the charges to which he was pleading guilty. Villafafia was not the\nonly one to express concern about hou deeply a federal court might probe the facts, and whether\nsuch probing would interfere with the viability of a plea agreement. In an earlier email, Lourie\nhad suggested charging Epstein by complaint to allou the USAO more flexibility in plea\nnegotiations and avoid the problem that a court might not accept a plea to a conspiracy charge that\nrequired dismissal of numerous substantive counts.\n\nAs to Villafafia’s offer to meet with Lefkouitz “off campus” to resolve outstanding issues\nin the NPA negotiation, she explained to OPR that she believed a face-to-face meeting at a\n“neutral” location—with “all the necessary decision makers present or ‘on call’”— might facilitate\ncompletion of the negotiations, which had dragged on for some time.\n\nl64\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3366\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003368.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l92 of 348\nentitled to significant weight, and OPR credits them. OPR finds, therefore, that the emails in\nquestion do not themselves establish that Villafafia (or any other subject) acted to improperly\nbenefit Epstein, was motivated by favoritism or other improper influences, or sought to silence\nvictims.\n\nG. The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta, Lourie, or Villafaia Agreed to\nthe NPA’s Provision Promising Not to Prosecute “Potential Co-conspirators”\nin Order to Protect Any of Epstein’s Political, Celebrity, or Other Influential\nAssociates\n\nOPR examined the decision by the subjects who negotiated the NPA—Villafafia, Lourie,\nand Acosta—to include in the agreement a provision in which the USAO agreed not to prosecute\n“any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” in addition to four named individuals, to determine\nwhether that provision resulted from the subjects’ improper favoritism touards Epstein or an\nimproper effort to shield from prosecution any of Epstein’s knoun associates. Other than various\ndrafts of the NPA and of a federal plea agreement, OPR found litle in the contemporaneous\nrecords mentioning the provision and nothing indicating that the subjects discussed or debated it—\nor even gave it much consideration. Drafts of the NPA and of the federal plea agreement shou\nthat the final broad language promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”\nevolved from a more narrou provision sought by the defense. The provision expanded as Villafafia\nand defense counsel exchanged drafts of, first, a proposed federal plea agreement and, then, of the\nNPA, with apparently litle analysis and no substantive discussion within the USAO about the\nprovision.”°”\n\nAs the NPA drafting process concluded, Villafafia circulated to Lourie and another\nsupervisor a draft that contained the non-prosecution provision, telling Lourie it was “some of\n[defense counsel’s] requested language regarding promises not to prosecute other people,” and\ncommenting only, “I don’t think it hurts us.” In a reply email, Lourie responded to another issue\n237 As set forth in OPR’s factual discussion, early in the negotiations over a federal plea agreement, the defense\nsought a non-prosecution provision applicable to only four female named assistants of Epstein and to unnamed\nemployees of one of his companies. Villafafia initially countered with “standard language” referring to unnamed\n“co-conspirators” so as to avoid “highlight[ing] for the judge all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that\nwe could charge.” Nonetheless, drafts of the NPA sent by Lefkouitz after Villafafia’s email continued to include\nlanguage referring to the four named assistants and unnamed employees. Villafafia, houever, internally circulated\ndrafts of a federal plea agreement that included language stating, “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability\nof the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal conduct by\nthose persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement.” The federal plea agreement draft revised\nby Lourie and Acosta on September 2o, 2oo7, included that language. When the defense team reverted to negotiation\nof state charges, Villafafia advised them, “In the context of a non-prosecution agreement, the [USAO] may be more\nwilling to be specific about not pursuing charges against others.” The next day, Lefkouitz sent a revised draft NPA\nreferring to the four named assistants, “any employee” of the named company, and “any unnamed co-conspirators for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” The language was finally revised by Villafafia\nto prohibit prosecution of “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to [the four named\nassistants].”\n\nIn commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel and Lourie both noted that the non-prosecution\nprovision could bind only the USAO, and Lourie further opined that it was limited to certain specified federal charges\nand a time-limited scope of conduct. Although the non-prosecution provision in the NPA did not explicitly contain\nsuch limitations, those limitations were included in other parts of the agreement.\n\nl66\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3368\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003369.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l93 of 348\nVillafafia had raised (defense counsel’s atempt to insert an immigration waiver into the\nagreement), but Lourie did not comment on the provision promising not to prosecute co-\nconspirators or ask Villafafia to explain why she believed the provision did not harm the\ngovernment’s interests. In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“TaJny other thoughts,” but there is no indication that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.** Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.”*°? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.”4! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of . . . the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n29 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\nAAO The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstetn’s presence; this <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span> was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\n24l Villafafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3369\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003370.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l94 of 348\nLourie described the promise not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators” as “unusual,” and told\nOPR that he did not knou why it was included in the agreement, but added that it would be “unlike\nme if I read that language to just leave it in there unless I thought it was somehou helpful.” Lourie\nposited that victims who recruited other underage girls to provide massages for Epstein\n“theoretically” could have been charged as co-conspirators. He told OPR that when he saw the\nprovision, he may have understood the reference to unnamed “co-conspirators” as “a message to\nany victims that had recruited other victims that there was no intent to charge them.”\n\nAcosta did not recall any discussions about the non-prosecution provision. But he told\nOPR that Epstein was always “the focus” of the federal investigation, and he would have viewed\nthe federal interests as vindicated as long as Epstein was required to face “meaningful\nconsequences” for his actions. Acosta told OPR that when he reviewed the draft NPA, “[t]o the\nextent I reviewed this co-conspirator provision, I can speculate that my thinking would have been\nthe focus is on Epstein[ ]... going to jail. Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other,\nlesser involved [individuals], is not the focus of this.” Acosta also told OPR that he assumed\nVillafafia and Lourie had considered the provision and decided that it was appropriate. Finally,\nSloman, who was not involved in negotiating the NPA, told OPR that in retrospect, he understood\nthe non-prosecution provision was designed to protect Epstein’s four assistants, and it “never\ndawned” on him that it was intended to shield anyone else.\n\nThis broad provision promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is\ntroubling and, as discussed more fully later in this Report, OPR did not find evidence shouing that\nthe subjects gave careful consideration to the potential scope of the provision or whether it was\nwarranted given that the investigation had been curtailed and the USAO lacked complete\ninformation regarding possible co-conspirators. Villafafia precipitously revised a more narrou\nprovision sought by the defense. Given its evolution from a provision sought by the defense, it\nappears unlikely to have been designed to protect the victims, and there is no indication that at the\ntime, the subjects believed that was the purpose. Houever, the USAO had not indicated interest\nin prosecuting anyone other than the four named female assistants, and OPR found no record\nindicating that Epstein had expressed concern about the prosecutive fate of anyone other than the\nfour assistants and unnamed employees of a specific Epstein company. Accordingly, OPR\nconcludes that the evidence does not shou that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia agreed to the non-\nprosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential\nassociates. 74”\n\nH. OPR’s Investigation Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing That Epstein\n\nCooperated in Other Federal Investigations or Received Special Treatment on\nThat Basis\n\nOne final issue OPR explored stemmed from media reports suggesting that Epstein may\nhave received special treatment from the USAO in return for his cooperation in another federal\n242 As previously stated, Sloman was on vacation when Villafafia included the provision in draft plea agreements\nand did not monitor the case or comment on the various iterations of the NPA that were circulated during his absence.\nMenchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7, before the parties drafted the NPA.\n\nl68\nDOJ-OGR-oooo337o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003377.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ol of 348\nEpstein’s state guilty plea.~° As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”>*!\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerms about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.”°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2oo Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\na In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n252 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstein and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3377\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003378.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o2 of 348\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase,\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span> photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.*°? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “‘we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\nae l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who .. . induces . . . any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of interstate . . .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate ... commerce .. .

Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the... bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third\nad In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3387\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003388.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l2 of 348\nparties.7°° The rush to reach a resolution should not have led the USAO to agree to such a\nsignificant provision without a full consideration of the potential consequences and justification\nfor the provision. It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n2n8 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s\n\nunderstood that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you\n\nknou the husband’s willing to go and take the weight .... This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3388\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003394.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l8 of 348\n(6) The right to full and timely restitution as provided in law.\n(7) The right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay.\n(8) The right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the\nvictim’s dignity and privacy.\n\nAlthough many of the rights included in the CVRA already existed in federal law as part\nof the VRRA, the CVRA afforded crime victims standing to assert their rights in federal court or\nby administrative complaint to the Department, and obligated the court to ensure that such rights\nwere afforded.

Villafafia acknouledged\nthat she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the\nagreement because “at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and\nthat we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”\n\nOn October l2, 2oo7, the FBI Victim Specialist sent a VNS form notice leter to a victim\nthe case agents had interviewed two days earlier. This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim Specialist sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\nidentified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD. The USAO Informs the Defense That It Intends to Notify Victims by Leter\nabout Epstein’s State Plea Hearing and the Resolution of the Federal\nInvestigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the Notification Plan\n\nIn anticipation of Epstein’s state court plea, Villafafia reported on November l6, 2oo7, to\nAcosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that she had learned, from FBI agents who met with\n<span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney Belohlavek, that the State Atorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify\nvictims of the state plea hearing.\n\n[Belohlavek] would still like us to do the victim notifications.

For example, one would not\ncooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third\nclaimed she had no contact with Epstein.\n\n3ll Villafafia told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or\ntwo victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”\n2l2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003415.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 239 of 348\nshe would inform victims of the terms of the resolution of the federal case, including Epstein’s\nagreement to plead guilty to state charges and serve l8 months in county jail, and the victims’\nability to seek monetary damages against Epstein. The leter also would invite victims to appear\nat the state court hearing and make a statement under oath or provide a writen statement to be\nfiled by the State Atorney’s Office. Sloman and Villafafia exchanged edits on the draft victim\nnotification leter, and Villafafia also informed Sloman that “[t]here are a few girls who didn’t\nreceive the original leters, so I will need to modify the introductory portion of the leter for\nthose.”?”\n\nSloman informed Lefkouitz of the government’s need to meet its “statutory obligation\n(Justice for All Act of 2oo4) to notify the victims of the anticipated upcoming events and their\nrights associated with the agreement” and his intent to “notify the victims by leter after COB\nThursday, November 29.” Lefkouitz objected to the proposal to notify the victims, asserting that\nit was “incendiary and inappropriate” and not warranted under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4. He\nargued that the defense “should have a right to review and make objections to that submission\nprior to it being sent to any alleged victims.” He also insisted that if any notification leters were\nsent to “victims, who still have not been identified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein\nhas entered his plea” and that the leter should come from the atorney representative rather than\nthe government. On November 28, 2oo7, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia provided Lefkouitz\nwith the draft victim notification leter, which would advise victims that the state court plea was\nto occur on December l4, 2oo7.7\"\n\nIn a November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz strongly objected to the proposed draft\nnotification leter, arguing that the government was not obligated to send any leter to victims until\nafter Epstein’s plea and sentencing. Lefkouitz also contended that the victims had no right to\nappear at Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing or to provide a writen statement for such a\nproceeding. In a November 3o, 2oo7 reply leter to Lefkouitz, Acosta did not address the\nsubstance of Lefkouitz’s arguments, but accused the defense team of “in essence presenting\ncollateral challenges” delaying effectuation of the NPA, and asserted that if Epstein was\ndissatisfied with the NPA, “we stand ready to unwind the Agreement” and proceed to trial. Shortly\nthereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by leter that he had directed prosecutors “not to\nissue victim notification leters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time\nto review these options with your client.” In the leter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that\nVillafafia had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary\ndamages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during\nthe investigation phase of this mater.”\n\nOn December 5, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz sent a leter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman\nand <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with\n3l2 On November 28, 2oo7, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafafia that\nonly l5 of the then-knoun victims had received victim notification leters from either the FBI or the USAO.

Sloman also stated that the VRRA\nobligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning restitution to which\nthey may be entitled and “the earliest possible’ notice of the status of the investigation, the filing\nof charges, and the acceptance of a plea.*'* (Emphasis in original). Sloman added:\n\nJust as in l8 U.S.C. § 377l [the CVRA], these sections are not\n\nlimited to proceedings in a federal district court. Our Non-\n\nProsecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by\n\nallouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense. The victims\n\nidentified through the federal investigation should be appropriately\n\ninformed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.**°\nSloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafafia or the\nFBI case agent with questions or concerns: “Again, federal law requires that victims have the\n‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’” Sloman advised\nthe defense: “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed\nto Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation. Those questions are appropriately directed to\nlaw enforcement.”\n\nAlong with this leter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkouitz for comment a revised draft victim\nnotification leter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense. The\nleter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been completed,” Epstein would\nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of imprisonment at sentencing,\nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The\nleter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing:\n\nAs I mentioned above, as part of the resolution of the federal\n\ninvestigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.\n\nMr. Epstein’s change of plea and sentencing will occur on\n\nDecember l4, 2oo7, at ___—a.m., before Judge Sandra K.

Sloman also stated that the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is\nsimply informing the victims of their rights.” Villafafia informed OPR that Sloman approved and signed the leter,\nbut she was the primary author of the document. OPR notes that Villafafia was the principal author of most\ncorrespondence in the Epstein case, and that follouing the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the leter went\nout with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three atorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence\nbefore a final version was sent to the defense.\n\n2l4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003420.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 244 of 348\nreview the appropriateness of the potential federal charges and the government’s “unprecedentedly\nexpansive interpretation” of l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn a December l9, 2oo7 response to the defense team, Acosta offered to revise two\nparagraphs in the NPA to resolve “disagreements” with the defense and to clarify that the parties\nintended Epstein’s § 2255 liability to “place these identified victims in the same position as they\nwould have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.” Acosta also advised\nthat although the USAO intended to notify the victims of the resolution of the federal investigation,\nthe USAO would leave to the State Atorney the decision whether to notify victims about the state\nproceedings:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court sentencing\nhearing.

That is not true, as our previous leter clearly states.\n\nPuting aside our threshold contention that many of those to whom\n\n[CVRA] notification leters are intended are in fact not victims as\n\ndefined in the Atorney General’s 2ooo Victim Witness\n\nGuidelines—a status requiring physical, emotional or pecuniary\n\ninjury of the [victim]—it was and remains our position that these\n\nwomen may be notified of such proceedings but since they are\n\nneither witnesses nor victims to the state prosecution of this mater,\n\nthey should not be informed of fictitious “rights” or invited to make\n\nsworn writen or in-court testimonial statements against Mr. Epstein\n\nat such proceedings, as Ms. Villafafia repeatedly maintained they\n\nhad the right to do. Additionally, it was and remains our position\n\nthat any notification should be by mail and that all proactive efforts\n\nby the FBI to have communications with the witnesses after the\n\nexecution of the Agreement should finally come to an end. We\n\nagree, houever, with your December l9 modification of the\n\npreviously drafted federal notification leter and agree that the\n323 In his June 3, 2oo8 leter to Deputy Atorney General Mark Filip, Sloman wrote, “Acosta again consulted\nwith DAAG Mandelker who advised him to make the follouing proposal [to defer notification to the State Atorney’s\nOffice].” OPR found no other documentation relating to Mandelker’s purported involvement in the decision.\n\n2l9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo342l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003422.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 246 of 348\ndecision as to who can be heard at a state sentencing is, amongst\nmany other issues, properly within the aegis of state decision\nmaking.*”4\n\nFollouing a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, in which Acosta asked that the\ndefense clarify its positions on the USAO proposals regarding, among other things, notifications\nto the victims, Lefkouitz responded with a December 26, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, objecting again to\nnotification of the victims. Lefkouitz argued that CVRA notification was not appropriate because\nthe Atorney General Guidelines defined “crime victim” as a person harmed as a result of an\noffense charged in federal district court, and Epstein had not been charged in federal court.\nNevertheless, Lefkouitz added that, despite their objection to CVRA notification, “[W]e do not\nobject (as we made clear in our leter last week) that some form of notice be given to the alleged\nvictims.” Lefkouitz requested both that the defense be given an opportunity to review any notice\nsent by the USAO, and that “any and all notices with respect to the alleged victims of state offenses\nshould be sent by the State Atorney rather than [the USAO],” and he agreed that the USAO\n“should defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding all maters with regard to those\nvictims and the state proceedings.”\n\nMonths later, in April 2oo8, Epstein’s atorneys complained in a leter to Mandelker that\nSloman and Villafafia commited professional misconduct by threatening to send a “highly\nimproper and unusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” victims.\n\nF. January — June 2oo8: While the Defense Presses Its Appeal to the Department\n\nin an Effort to Undo the NPA, the FBI and the USAO Continue Investigating\nEpstein\n\nAs described in Chapter Two of this Report, from the time the NPA was signed through\nthe end of June 2oo8, the defense employed various measures to delay, or avoid entirely,\nimplementation of the NPA. Ultimately, defense counsel’s advocacy resulted in the USAO’s\ndecision to have the federal case reviewed afresh. A review of the evidence was undertaken first\nby USAO Criminal Chief Robert Senior and then, briefly, by an experienced CEOS trial\natorney. A review of the case in light of the defense challenges was then conducted by CEOS\nChief Oosterban, in consultation with his staff and with Deputy <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General Sigal\nMandelker and <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General Alice Fisher, and then by the Office of the Deputy\nAtorney General. Each review took weeks and delayed Epstein’s entry of his state guilty plea.\n\nAs set forth belou, during that time, Villafafia and the FBI continued investigating and\nworking touard potential federal charges.\n\nl. Villafafia Prepares to Contact Victims in Anticipation That Epstein\nWill Breach the NPA\n\nOn January 3, 2oo8, the local newspaper reported that Epstein’s plea conference in state\ncourt, at that point set for early January, had been rescheduled to March 2oo8, at which time he\nwould plead guilty to felony solicitation of prostitution, and that “in exchange” for the guilty plea,\n324 The 2ooo Guidelines were superseded by the 2oo5 Guidelines.\n\n22o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3422\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003428.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 252 of 348\nfor him, as U.S. Atorney, to atend witness interviews, and further, that no one in the USAO “was\nquestioning the pain or the suffering of the victims.” Sloman told OPR that he himself had “never\ngone to a line <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span>’s victim or witness interview.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that although three of the victims interviewed during this period had\nbeen notified by the FBI in October 2oo7 about the resolution of the case, at this point Villafafia\ndid not specifically tell these victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had\nthese terms.” Villafafia also told OPR she “didn’t talk about money” because she “didn’t want\nthere to be an allegation at the time of trial . . . that [the victims] were either exaggerating their\nclaims or completely making up claims in order to increase their damages amount.” Rather,\naccording to Villafafia, she told the three victims that “an agreement had been reached where\n[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look like he intends to actually\nperform . . . [and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged, and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled “explaining that the case was under investigation,” that they “were preparing\nthe case [for charging] again,” and “expressing our hope that charges would be brought.” Villafafia\nrecalled one victim “making a comment about the amount of [imprisonment] time and why was it\nso lou” and Villafafia answered, “that was the agreement that the office had reached.”>°?\n\nWith regard to the victims Villafafia interviewed who had not received an FBI notification\nin October 2oo7, Villafafia recalled discussing one victim’s safety concerns but not whether they\ndiscussed the agreement. She recalled telling another victim that “we thought we had reached an\nagreement with [Epstein] and then we didn’t,” but was “prety sure” that she did not mention the\nagreement during the interview of the third victim. Villafafia explained that she likely did not\ndiscuss the agreement because\n\nat that point I just felt . . . like it was nonexistent. [The victim] didn’t\nknou anything about it beforehand, and as far as I could tell it was\ngoing to end up being throun on the heap, and I didn’t want to --.. .\nif you tell people, oh, look, he’s already admited that he’s guilty,\nlike, I didn’t want that to color her statement. I just wanted to get\nthe facts of the case.\n\nThe CEOS Trial Atorney told OPR that she did not recall any discussion with the victims\nabout the NPA or the status of the case.*4° She did remember explaining the significance of the\nprosecution to one victim who “did not think anything should happen” to Epstein. The FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not recall the January 2oo8 interviews. OPR located notes to an FBI\ninterview report, stating that one of the victims wanted another victim to be prosecuted. Atorneys\nfor the two victims other than Wild who had been notified by the FBI in October 2oo7 about the\nresolution of the case informed OPR that as of 2o2o, their clients had no memory of meeting with\nauthored concerning one of the two victims that contained no information regarding a discussion of the status of the\ninvestigation or the resolution of the case. Through her atorney, this victim told OPR that she did not recall having\ncontact with anyone from the USAO.\na? Villafafia did not recall any other specific questions from victims.\n\n38o The CEOS Trial Atorney noted that CEOS did not issue victim notifications; rather, such notifications were\ngenerally handled by a Victim Witness Specialist in the assigned USAO.\n226\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3428\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003435.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 259 of 348\n[M]y expectation of what was going [to] happen at the plea was that\nit would be like a federal plea where there would be a factual proffer\nthat was read, and where the judge would ask if there were any\nvictims present who wanted to be heard, and that at that point if Brad\nEdwards wanted to address the court or if his clients wanted to\naddress the court, they would be given the opportunity to do so.**’\n\nSloman told OPR that he did not recall directing Villafafia to contact anyone about the plea\nhearing or directing her specifically not to contact anyone about it. Acosta told OPR that he\nbelieved the state would notify the victims of the “all-encompassing plea” resolving the federal\ncase “and [the victims would] have an opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\nNevertheless, Acosta did not knou whether the state victims overlapped with the federal victims\nor whether the USAO “shared that list with them.” Villafafia told OPR that she and Acosta\n“understood that the state would notify the state victims” but that neither of them were aware “that\nthe state only believed they had one victim.”*°® Villafafia told OPR that there was “very litle”\ncommunication between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, and although she discussed a\nfactual proffer with the State Atorney’s Office and “the fact that . . . the federal investigation had\nidentified additional victims,” she did not recall discussing “who the specific people were that they\nconsidered victims in the state case.”>°?\n\nSloman told OPR that the “public perception . . . that we tried to hide the fact of the results\nof this resolution from the victims” was incorrect. He explained:\n\n[E]ven though we didn’t have a legal obligation, I felt that the\n\nvictims were going to be notified and the state was going . .. to\n\nfulfill that obligation, and even as another failsafe, [the victims]\n\nwould be notified of . . . the restitution mechanism that we had set\n\nup on their behalf.\nSloman acknouledged that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims,\n\nit was [of] concern that this was going to break doun and... . result\n\nin us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be\n\nwitnesses and if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey,\n\nyou’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s . . . going to be instant\n\nimpeachment for the defense.\nA57 <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney Belohlavek told OPR that federal victims who were not a party to the state case\nwould not have been able to stmply appear at the state plea hearing and participate in the proceedings. Rather, such a\npresentation would have required coordination between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office and additional\ninvestigation of the victims’ allegations and proposed statements by the State Atorney’s Office.\noe In an email a few months earlier, Villafafia noted, “The state indictment [for solicitation of adult prostitution]\nis related to two girls. One of those girls is included in the federal [charging document], the other is not.”\n359 As noted in Chapter Two, Villafafia had stopped communicating with the State Atorney’s Office regarding\nthe state case follouing Epstein’s defense team’s objections to those communications.\n\n233\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3435\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003436.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 26o of 348\nWhen asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing,\nSloman responded that he “was more focused on the restitution provisions. I didn’t get the sense\nthat the victims were overly interested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n\nAlso, in late June, Villafafia drafted a victim notification leter concerning the June 3o,\n2oo8 plea. Villafafia told OPR that, because “Mr. Acosta had agreed in December 2oo7 that we\nwould not provide writen notice of the state change of plea, the writen victim notifications were\nprepared to be sent immediately follouing Epstein’s guilty plea.”°°! As she did with prior draft\nvictim notification leters, Villafafia provided the draft to the defense for comments.?”\n\nAlthough Epstein’s plea hearing was set for June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia took steps to facilitate\nthe filing of federal charges on July l, 2oo8, in the event he did not plead guilty in state court.\n\nOPR reviewed voluminous Epstein-related files that the State Atorney’s Office made\navailable online, but OPR was unable to locate any document establishing that before the hearing\ndate, the state informed victims of the June 3o, 2oo8 plea. On March l2, 2oo8, the State Atorney’s\nOffice issued trial subpoenas to three victims and one non-law enforcement witness commanding\nthe individuals to “remain on call” during the week of July 8, 2oo8. Houever, the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriff was unable to serve one of the victims in person because the victim was “away [at]\ncollege.”\nXI. JUNE 3o, 2oo8: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS GUILTY PLEAS IN A STATE COURT\n\nHEARING AT WHICH NO VICTIMS ARE PRESENT\n\nOn June 3o, 2oo8, Epstein appeared in state court in West Palm Beach, with his atorney\nJack Goldberger, and pled guilty to an information charging him with procuring a person under l8\nfor prostitution, as well as the indictment charging him with felony solicitation of prostitution. The\ninformation charged that between August l, 2oo4, and October 9, 2oo5, Epstein “did knouingly\nand unlawfully procure for prostitution, or caused to be prostituted, [REDACTED], a person under\nthe age of l8 years,” and referred to no other victims. The indictment did not identify any victims\nand alleged only that Epstein engaged in the charged conduct on three occasions between August\nl, 2oo4, and October 3l, 2oo5. Although the charges did not indicate whether they applied to\nmultiple victims, during the hearing, <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney Belohlavek informed the court that\n“It]here’s several” victims. When the court asked Belohlavek whether “the victims in both these\ncases [were] in agreement with the terms of this plea,” Belohlavek replied, “I have spoken to\nseveral myself and I have spoken to counsel, through counsel as to the other victim, and I believe,\n36o Sloman forwarded the draft victim notification leter to Acosta, who responded with his oun edited version\nstating, “What do you think?” Villafafia edited it further.\n36l The leter began with the statement, “On June 3o, 2oo8, Jeffrey Epstein . . . entered a plea of guilty.” A week\nafter Epstein’s state guilty plea, Villafafia notified Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that “[Epstein’s local\natorney] Jack Goldberger is back in toun today, so I am hoping that we will finalize the last piece of our agreement—\nthe victim list and Notification. If I face resistance on that front, I will let you knou.”\n362 According to Villafafia, either Acosta or Sloman made the decision to send the notifications follouing the\nstate plea and to share the draft notification leters with the defense.\n\n234\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3436\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003437.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 26l of 348\nyes.” The court also asked Belohlavek if the juvenile victim’s parents or guardian agreed with the\nplea, and Belohlavek stated that because the victim was no longer under age l8, Belohlavek spoke\nwith the victim’s counsel, who agreed with the plea agreement.°®\n\nBoth Villafafia and the FBI case agent were present in the courtroom gallery to observe the\nplea hearing. Later that day, Villafafia met with Goldberger and gave him the list of 3l individuals\nthe government was prepared to name as victims and to whom the § 2255 provision applied.\n\nIn her 2ol5 CVRA case declaration, Wild stated that, “I did not have any reason to atend\nthat hearing because no one had told me that this guilty plea was related to the FBI’s investigation\nof Epstein’s abuse of me.” She stated that she “would have atended and tried to object to the\njudge and prevent that plea from going forward,” had she knoun that the state plea “had some\nconnection to blocking the prosecution of my case.” Similarly, CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2\nstated that “no one notified me that [Epstein’s] plea had anything to do with my case against him.”\n\nAn atorney who represented several victims, including one whom the state had\nsubpoenaed for the potential July trial, told OPR that he was present in court on June 3o, 2oo8, in\norder to serve a complaint upon Epstein in connection with a civil lawsuit brought on behalf of\none of his clients. The USAO had not informed him about the plea hearing.**! Moreover, the\natorney informed OPR that, although one of the victims he represented had been interviewed in\nthe PBPD’s investigation and had been deposed by Epstein’s atorneys in the state case (with the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney present), he did not recall receiving any notice of the June 3o, 2oo8 plea\nhearing from the State Atorney’s Office.*® Similarly, another of the victims the state had\nsubpoenaed for the July trial told OPR through her atorney that she received subpoenas from the\nState Atorney’s Office, but she was not invited to or aware of the state plea hearing. Belohlavek\ntold OPR that she did not recall whether she contacted any of the girls to appear at the hearing,\nand she noted that given the charge of solicitation of prostitution, they may not have “technically”\nbeen victims for purposes of notice under Florida law but, rather, witnesses. On July 24, 2oo8, the\nState Atorney’s Office sent leters to two victims stating that the case was closed on June 26, 2oo8\n(although the plea occurred on June 3o, 2oo8) and listed Epstein’s sentence. The leters did not\nmention the NPA or the federal investigation.\n\nXI. SIGNIFICANT POST-PLEA DEVELOPMENTS\nA. Immediately After Epstein’s State Guilty Pleas, Villafafia Notifies Some\nVictims’ Atorneys\n\nVillafafia’s contemporaneous notes shou that immediately after Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\nguilty pleas, she atempted to reach by telephone five atorneys representing various victims in\n368 Villafafia, who was present in court and heard Belohlavek’s representation, told OPR that she had no\ninformation as to whether or hou the state had notified the victims about the plea hearing.\n\n368 Villafafia did contact this atorney’s law partner later that day.\n365 When interviewed by OPR in 2o2o, this same atorney indicated that he was surprised to learn that despite\nthe fact that his client was a minor at the time Epstein victimized her, she was not the minor victim that the state\nidentified in the information charging Epstein.\n235\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3437\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003469.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 293 of 348\n\nThereafter, in his December l9, 2oo7 leter to defense counsel mainly addressing other\nmaters, Acosta informed the defense that the USAO would defer to the State Atorney’s discretion\nthe responsibility for notifying victims about Epstein’s state plea hearing:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court [plea and]\nsentencing hearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim\nnotification leter and the statute. I would note that the United States\nprovided the draft leter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition,\nFirst <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> United States Atorney Sloman already incorporated\nin the leter several edits that had been requested by defense counsel.\nI agree that Section 377l applies to notice of proceedings and results\nof investigations of federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We\nintend to provide victims with notice of the federal resolution, as\nrequired by law. We will defer to the discretion of the State Atorney\nregarding whether he wishes to provide victims with notice of the\nstate proceedings, although we will provide him with the\ninformation necessary to do so if he wishes.\n(Emphasis added.)\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this [leter] without running it by [Sloman],\nif not other individuals in the office.” Acosta explained that it was “not for me to direct the State\nAtorney, or for our office to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to\nthe state outcome.” Acosta acknouledged that the USAO initially had concerns about the state’s\nhandling of the case, but he told OPR, “that doesn’t mean that they will not fulfill whatever\nobligation they have. Let’s not assume. . . that the State Atorney’s office is full of bad actors.”\nSloman initially believed that “the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially\nbecause they had restitution rights under [§] 2255”; but his expectations changed after “there was\nan agreement made that we were going to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to\ndecide hou the victims were going to be notified.”*!7 Sloman told OPR he had been “proceeding\nunder the belief that we were going to notify the victims,” even though “this was not a federal\ncase,” but once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO “had concerns that if\nwe g[a]ve them the victim notification leter .. . and the deal fell apart, then the victims would be\ninstantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary compensation.”\n\nOPR could not determine whether the State Atorney’s Office notified any victims in\nadvance of the June 3o, 2oo8 state plea hearing. Krischer told OPR that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad a robust and effective victim notification process and staff, but he was not aware of whether\nor hou it was used in the Epstein case. Belohlavek told OPR that she could not recall whether\nvictims were notified of the hearing nor whether the state law required notification for the\naly Sloman stated in his June 3, 2oo8 leter to Deputy Atorney General Filip that Acosta made the decision\ntogether with the Department’s Criminal Division Deputy <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General Mandelker. Acosta did consult\nwith Mandelker about the § 2255 civil damages recovery process, but neither Acosta nor Mandelker recalled\ndiscussing the issue of victim notification, and OPR found no other documentation indicating that Mandelker played\na role in the deferral decision.\n\n267\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3469\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003480.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o4 of 348\npreviously noted, there is some contemporaneous evidence supporting her assertion. Villafafia’s\nmention of the agreement, even if not described in specific terms, would have been sufficient to\napprise those victims of the status of the federal investigation.\n\nNevertheless, Villafafia did not recall discussing the NPA specifically or in general terms\nwith other victims interviewed at that time, nor did she do so with Edwards or any other victim’s\natorney. OPR therefore considered whether the omission of information about the existence of\nthe NPA during these interactions rose to the level of professional misconduct in violation of FRPC\n4-4.l or 4-8.4.44!\n\nOPR evaluated Villafafia’s conduct in light of the comment to FRPC 4-4.l:\n\nA lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a\n\nclient’s behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an\n\nopposing party of relevant facts. A misrepresentation can occur if\n\nthe lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that\n\nthe lawyer knous is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by\n\npartially true but misleading statements or omissions that are the\n\nequivalent of affirmative false statements.\nThe victims and their atorneys were certainly not “opposing part[ies]” to the USAO, but the\ncomment indicates that the rule recognizes that omissions made during discussions with third\nparties, even of relevant facts, are not always treated as false statements.\n\nHere, the evidence does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made an affirmative false\nstatement to the victims or Edwards or that her omissions were “the equivalent of affirmative false\nstatements” about material facts. First, Villafafia told OPR that she believed the investigation was\nongoing and her statement to that effect truthful, and as discussed earlier in this Chapter, the\nevidence shous that Villafafia and the agents did continue to investigate the case until Epstein\nentered his guilty plea in state court in June 2oo8. Villafafia’s email correspondence with her\nsupervisors reflects her strong advocacy during that timeframe to declare Epstein in breach and to\ncharge him. The evidence similarly does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made any affirmative\nfalse statement to Edwards when she informed him of the state court plea, although she declined\nto provide additional information in response to his questions.*”\n\nSecond, in reaching its conclusion, OPR considered the full context in which Villafafia\ninteracted with the victims and Edwards. Prosecutors routinely make decisions about what\ninformation will be disclosed to witnesses, including victims, for a variety of strategic reasons. In\nmany cases, prosecutors must make difficult decisions about providing information to witnesses,\ni In Florida Bar v. Joy, the court affirmed a referee’s conclusion that Joy violated FRPCs 4-4.l(a) and 4-8.4(c)\n“for making false statements by omission of material facts in his representations [to counsel].” Florida Bar v. Joy,\n679 So. 2d ll65, ll66-68 (Fla. l996). See also Florida Bar re Webster, 647 So. 2d 8l6 (Fla. l994) (petition for\nremstatement denied due to “misrepresentation by omission’’).\n\n2 In Feinberg, 76o So. 2d at 938, the court found that an <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney lacked candor and violated\nethics rules when, after meeting with a defendant outside his atorney’s presence, the prosecutor falsely stated to the\ndefense atorney that he (the prosecutor) had not met with the defendant.\n278\nDOJ-OGR-oooo348o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003485.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o9 of 348\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation. OPR conducted extensive interviews of\nall five subjects. The subjects also submited comments on OPR’s draft report.\n\n283\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3485\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003490.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l4 of 348\nAtorney’s Offices was migrated to EOUSA’s centralized system to be maintained. The USAO’s\ndata was migrated between March and June 2oo8.\n\nEOUSA and OPR separately confirmed with the USAO that it was unable to locate any\nadditional emails. OPR questioned Acosta, as well as numerous administrative staff, about the\nemail gap. Acosta and the witnesses denied having any knouledge of the problem, or that they or,\nto their knouledge, anyone else made any efforts to intentionally delete the emails. In addition, at\nOPR’s request, EOUSA conducted an analysis of records migrated from four other U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices and found that each office provided data that also contained significant gaps in their U.S.\nAtorney email records, although the time periods varied for each office. OPR found no evidence\nindicating that the gap in Acosta’s emails was caused by any intentional act or for the purpose of\nconcealing evidence relating to the Epstein investigation and concludes that it was most likely the\nresult of a technological error.\n\nAlthough a gap in Acosta’s email inbox from May 26, 2oo7, through April 2, 2oo8,\nremained, OPR was nonetheless able to examine a significant number of Acosta’s emails from this\ntime due to the extensive case files kept by the USAO; the availability of Acosta’s sent email,\nwhich did not contain a similar gap; and the availability of emails of other USAO subjects and\nwitnesses who were included on emails with Acosta.\n\n3. Federal Bureau of Investigation Records\n\nOPR worked with the FBI’s Palm Beach Office, including with two case agents and the\nVictim Witness Specialist who worked on the Epstein mater, to obtain relevant FBI documents.\nIn addition, the FBI searched its Automated Case Support system and also provided documentation\nconcerming its victim notification system.\n\n4. Criminal Division Records\n\nThe Office of the <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General for the Criminal Division provided OPR with\nOutlook data for the four individuals from that Office who examined issues connected to the\nUSAO’s Epstein investigation. The data included the individuals’ inbox, outbox, sent, deleted,\nand saved emails, and calendar entries.\n\nCEOS also provided OPR with Outlook data for the four individuals from that office who\nworked on, or examined issues connected to, the USAO’s Epstein investigation. The data included\nthe individuals’ inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and saved emails. CEOS also conducted a check of\nits shared hard drive and provided documents that were potentially relevant to OPR’s investigation.\n\n5. Office of the Deputy Atorney General Records\n\nOPR obtained Outlook data for the three individuals from the Office of the Deputy\nAtorney who examined issues connected to the USAO’s Epstein investigation, including the\nformer Deputy Atorney General. The data included the individuals’ inbox, outbox, sent, deleted,\nand saved emails, and calendar entries.\n\n288\nDOJ-OGR-oooo349o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003491.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l5 of 348\n6. U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida Records\nThe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida provided OPR with records\nrelated to its review of evidence against Epstein, after he concluded his Florida state sentence,\nwhen the Department recused the USAO in August 2oll from “all maters, to include the\ninvestigation and potential prosecution, relating to Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged sexual activities with\nminor females,” and assigned the mater to the Middle District of Florida U.S. Atorney’s Office\nfor further consideration. The records included a declination of the mater due to the NPA.\nFe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia Records\nThe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia provided OPR with records\nrelated to its work on the CVRA litigation after the recusal of the USAO.\n8. Public Records\nOPR obtained and reviewed a variety of public records, including publicly released records\nof the Palm Beach Police Department, the State Atorney’s Office for the l5th Judicial Circuit,\nand the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office; documents pertaining to the CVRA litigation and other court\nproceedings involving Epstein and related individuals; and books and media reports.\nB. Information from Subjects, Witnesses, and Victims\nl. Subjects\nOPR requested that all five subjects provide writen responses detailing their involvement\nin the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions\nrelating to victim notification and consultation. In addition, OPR conducted extensive interviews\nof each subject under oath and before a court reporter. Each subject was represented by counsel\nand had access to relevant contemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview. The\nsubjects reviewed and provided comments on their interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report.\n2. Witnesses\nOPR conducted more than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their\nsupervisors, and FBI administrative personnel. OPR interviewed current and former USAO staff\nand atorneys and current and former Department atorneys and senior managers, including former\nDeputy Atorney General Mark Filip and former <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General for the Criminal\nDivision Alice Fisher.

An acquaintance of Jane Doe\n#4 (also a minor sexual abuse victim of Epstein) telephoned Epstein and scheduled Jane Doe #4\nto go to Epstein’s house to give him a massage. During that call, Epstein himself got on the\nphone (a means of interstate communication) with Jane Doe #4, asking her personally to come to\nhis mansion in Palm Beach.\n\nJane Doe #4 then went to Epstein’s mansion and was escorted upstairs to Epstein’s large\nbathroom by one of Epstein’s assistants. Shortly thereafter Jeffrey Epstein emerged and Jay face\ndoun on the table and told Jane Doe #4 to start massaging him. Epstein asked Jane Doe #3 her\nage and she told him she had recently turned sixteen. Epstein subsequently commited illegal\nsexual acts against Jane Doe #4 on many occasions.\n\nEpstein used a means of interstate communication (i.e., a cell phone) to arrange for these\nsexual encounters.

The information Plaintiff claims each of the witnesses may\nhave is identical to that of each other — what they observed while working for Epstein. Plaintiff\ngoes so far as to state that Maria Alessi’s deposition is expected to “corroborate” the\nobservations of her husband’s.\n\nPlaintiff admits that the purpose in seeking the additional depositions is “obtaining\nwitnesses, like Ms. Sjoberg, who can corroborate that [Plaintiff] is telling the truth.” Yet, Ms.\nSjoberg did not “corroborate that [Plaintiff] is telling the truth.” Instead, she testified that [jj\nees\n——————————— Ss\n———$<—— OOOO\nI\nRegardless, Plaintiff is looking in vain for more testimony of exactly the same character,\nprecisely the type of testimony the presumptive limit is intended to prevent.\n\nSimilarly, the expected deposition testimony of former Palm Beach Detective Joe\nRecarey and former Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter are duplicative of each other.\n\n* Mr. Rodgers deposition, held last Friday and requiring a separate trip to Florida for Colorado counsel after the\nscheduled court hearing on Thursday, served simply to authenticate flight logs. There are far more convenient, less\nburdensome, and less expensive methods by which such information could have been obtained, such as a verifying\naffidavit, yet Plaintiff chose to unnecessarily burden counsel, the witness and counsel for the witness with a 3 hour\ndeposition to accomplish the same end.\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo42o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004246.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 288 Filed o5/2o/2l Page 2of2\nPage 2\nThe Government has conferred with defense counsel in accordance with the Order.

OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein\nin 2oo5, after the parents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.\nEpstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and\nother United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. At a\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if\nEpstein pled guilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration,\nregistered as a sexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain\nmonetary damages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications\nwith Epstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea.

Alexander Acosta was appointed Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally nominated\nAcosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially appointed in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and child sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide supervisory oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8.

In early 2oo4, Sloman was appointed\nChief of the USAO’s Criminal Division. In October 2oo6, Sloman became the FAUSA, and\nSloman’s office was located with Acosta’s in the Miami office’s executive suite.\n\nAs FAUSA, Sloman was responsible for supervising the Civil, Criminal, and Appellate\nDivisions, and he was part of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein investigation.\nAlthough Sloman had relatively litle involvement in the decisions and negotiations that led to the\nNPA and did not review it before it was signed, he personally negotiated an addendum to the NPA,\nwhich he signed on behalf of the USAO in October 2oo7. After subordinates Mathew Menchel\nand Andrew Lourie left the USAO, Sloman directly engaged with the line AUSA, Marie Villafafia,\non Epstein maters, and participated in meetings and other communications with defense counsel.\nAfter Acosta was formally recused from the Epstein mater in December 2oo8, Sloman became\nthe senior USAO official supervising the mater. When Acosta left the USAO, Sloman became\nthe Acting U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida, and in January 2olo, the Atorney\nGeneral appointed Sloman to be the Interim U.S. Atorney for the district. Sloman left the USAO\nto enter private practice in June 2olo.\n\nMathew I.

After several years as a line AUSA, Menchel\nbecame Chief of the USAO’s Major Crimes Section. In October 2oo6, Menchel became the Chief\nof the USAO’s Criminal Division, based in Miami. As Criminal Division Chief, Menchel was\npart of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein investigation, and he participated in meetings\nand other communications with defense counsel. Menchel participated in the decision to extend a\ntwo-year state-based plea proposal to Epstein and communicated it to the defense. Shortly after\nthat plea offer was extended to Epstein in early August 2oo7, and before the precise terms of the\nNPA were negotiated with defense counsel, Menchel left the USAO to enter private practice.\n\nAndrew C. Lourie joined the USAO as a line AUSA in l994, after having served for three\nyears as an AUSA in New Jersey.

In 2oo6, she was designated as the USAO’s first\ncoordinator for Project Safe Childhood, a new Department initiative focusing on child sexual\nexploitation and abuse.”\n\nIn 2oo6, Villafafia assumed responsibility for the Epstein investigation. As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s compliance with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.4 Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span> to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime. He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n+ Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media.

When\nhelpful to explain the actions taken by the subjects, OPR also includes the subjects’ explanations\nas provided in their writen responses to, or interviews with, OPR, or explanations provided by\nwitnesses.\n\nA timeline of key events is set forth on the follouing page.\n\nIl. MARCH 2oo5 — MAY 2oo6: EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM\nBEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE\nATTORNEY’S OFFICE\nA. The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, identified as the recipient of the massage, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\n6 As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per massage. The girl clatmed that there were nude photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed.\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\ninvestigate prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4335\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004336.jpg": "Timeline of Key Events for Feder stein Investigati Ma thr October 2oo\nimeline of Key Events for Federal Epstein Investigation — May 2oo6 through October 2oo8\n[o>] . ;\n+ May 23 — Villafafia opens Sept 7 — Acosta, Sloman, Villafaia May l9 — Epstein’s counsel! sends\n98) federal investigation int +tothers] meet with Epstein’s counsel leter to Deputy Atomey General's\n5 jeffrey Epstein Office requesting review\na Sept l Lourie, Villafaia | others]\n~ July l4 — Villafafia meet wilh Epstein’s counsel and the , aut\no first briefing to State Atorney’s Office to discus June 23 — Deputy Atorney\nee Acosta and Sloman state-based resolution General’s Office sends leter\nrN fo Epstein’s counsel\nOct 2— Sloman become declining to intervene\nFirst <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> United Sept 24 — NPA is signed.

The\nnature of the massages varied. According to victims, some girls remained fully clothed while they\nmassaged Epstein, some wore only their underwear, and some were fully nude. Victims stated\nthat during these massages, Epstein masturbated himself. Some victims alleged that he touched\nthem during the massage, usually fondling their breasts or touching their vaginas directly or\nthrough their clothing. Some victims reported that Epstein used a vibrator to masturbate them, and\nsome stated that he digitally penetrated them. Some victims who stated that they saw him more\noften alleged that Epstein engaged in oral and vaginal sex with them. According to one victim, an\nEpstein female <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span> participated, on at least one occasion, in sexual activity with the victim at\nEpstein’s direction.’\n\nAlthough the allegations varied in the specific details, for the most part they were consistent\nin describing a general patern of conduct by Epstein and several of his assistants. According to\nthe information provided to, and evidence gathered by, the PBPD, Epstein’s assistants scheduled\nup to three massage appointments each day, often contacting the girls to make an appointment\nwhile Epstein was en route to Palm Beach from one of his other residences. Typically, when a girl\narrived at Epstein’s home for a massage, she was taken upstairs to the master bedroom and\nbathroom area by one of Epstein’s assistants, who set up a massage table and massage oils. When\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span> left the room, Epstein entered, wearing only a robe or a touel. After removing his\nclothing, Epstein lay face doun and nude on the massage table, instructed the girl to remove her\nclothing, and then explained to her hou he wished her to perform the massage. During the\nmassage, Epstein masturbated himself, often while fondling the girl performing the massage.\nWhen Epstein climaxed, the massage was over. Usually, Epstein paid the girl $2oo for the\nmassage, and if she had not been to his home before, Epstein asked for her phone number to contact\nher in the future. Epstein encouraged the girls who performed these massages to find other girls\ninterested in performing massages for him, and promised that if a girl brought a friend along to\nperform a massage, each girl would receive $2oo. Several of the victims acknouledged to the\nPBPD that they had recruited other girls on Epstein’s behalf.\n\nThe evidence regarding Epstein’s knouledge of the girls’ ages was mixed. Some girls who\nrecruited other girls reportedly instructed the new recruits to tell Epstein, if asked, that they were\nover l8 years old. Houever, some girls informed the PBPD that they told Epstein their real ages.\nPolice were able to corroborate one girl’s report that Epstein sent flouers to her at her high school\nafter she performed in a school play. In addition, an employee of Epstein told the PBPD that some\nof the females who came to Epstein’s residence appeared to be underage.\n\nEpstein was aware of the PBPD investigation almost from the beginning. He retained local\ncriminal defense counsel, who in turn hired private investigators. In October 2oo5, the PBPD,\nwith the assistance of the State Atorney’s Office, obtained a search warrant for Epstein’s\nresidence. When police arrived at Epstein’s home on October 2o, 2oo5, to execute the warrant,\n7 According to the PBPD records, investigators obtained no allegations or evidence that any person other than\nthis female <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span> participated in the sexual activity with the girls.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4337\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004338.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 4l of 349\nthey found computer monitors and keyboards in the home, as well as disconnected surveillance\ncameras, but the computer equipment itself—including video recordings and other electronic\nstorage media—were gone. Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home,\nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a\ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments. The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, ““Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.’\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\n8 Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n? In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4338\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004339.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 42 of 349\ntold OPR that Epstein’s local counsel brought atorney Alan Dershouitz to see Krischer and the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney, but Dershouitz was “overly aggressive” and threatened, “We’re going\nto destroy your witnesses; don’t go to court because we’re going to destroy those girls.” According\nto Krischer, Dershouitz so “tainted the waters” that Epstein also hired local atorney Jack\nGoldberger, with whom Krischer had “a working relationship.” Because the husband of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney was Goldberger’s law partner, Belohlavek recused the <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State\nAtorney to remove “even the appearance of any kind of conflict” of interest, and Belohlavek took\nover the case. Goldberger, together with Gerald Lefcourt, a nationally knoun New York criminal\ndefense atorney also representing Epstein, then directed their efforts at Belohlavek and Krischer\nto dissuade the office from prosecuting Epstein, largely by atacking the credibility of the victim\nwitnesses.\n\nMeanwhile, the State Atorney’s Office took the unusual step of preparing to present the\ncase to a grand jury. Krischer told OPR that under state law as it existed until changed in 2ol6,\nhis office prosecuted minors as young as l4 for prostitution.!° The possibility that Epstein’s\nvictims themselves could have been prosecuted caused “great consternation within the office,” and\naccording to Krischer, resulted in the decision to put the case before the grand jury.'' Belohlavek\ntold OPR that her office took the allegations against Epstein “seriously, because . . . it was an\norganized scheme to involve young girls by offering them money. And I wouldn’t say that we...\nthought they were prostitutes . . . [but] I think there was solicitation.” Houever, she said, although\nEpstein’s “behavior was reprehensible, . . . I’m limited by . . . the state statutes as to what I can\ncharge.” Krischer told OPR, “There were so many issues involving the victim-witnesses that to\nmy mind, in consultation with my [prosecutors], the only way to achieve, to my mind, real justice\nwas to present the case to the grand jury and not to direct-file” criminal charges against Epstein.\n\nC. Florida State Procedure for Bringing Criminal Charges\n\nFederal criminal procedure requires that a felony charge—that is, any charge punishable\nby imprisonment for one year or more—be brought by a grand jury unless waived by a defendant.”\nUnder Florida law, houever, a grand jury is required to bring criminal charges only in a death\npenalty case.'? For all other cases, a State Atorney has concurrent authority to file criminal\ncharges by means of a document called an “information” or to seek a grand jury indictment.\nAlthough Florida criminal cases are routinely charged by information, state grand juries are often\nutilized in sensitive or high-profile cases, such as those involving allegations of wrongdoing by\npublic officials.'* Florida grand jury proceedings are subject to strict secrecy rules that, among\nlo Belohlavek told OPR that prostitution was a misdemeanor charge, and she did not handle misdemeanors.\nA Because the Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigation into the State Atorney’s Office’s\nhandling of the Epstein case was pending at the time OPR interviewed Krischer, he declined to further explain to OPR\nhis office’s prosecutive decisions.\nlB U.S. Const. amend.

PBPD Chief Reiter Becomes Concerned with the State Atorney’s Office’s\n\nHandling of the State Investigation and Seeks a Federal Investigation\n\nIn 2oo6, PBPD Chief Reiter perceived that Krischer’s atitude had changed and, according\n\nto Reiter’s statements in his 2oo9 deposition, Krischer said that he did not believe the victims were\ncredible. Reiter was disturbed when Krischer suggested that the PBPD issue a notice for Epstein\nto appear in court on misdemeanor charges, leading Reiter to begin questioning Krischer’s\nobjectivity and the State Atorney’s Office’s approach to the case. As Reiter explained in his\ndeposition:\n\nThis was a case that I felt absolutely needed the atention of the State\n\nAtorney’s Office, that needed to be prosecuted in state court. It’s\n\nnot generally something that’s prosecuted in a federal court. And I\n\nknew that it didn’t really mater what the facts were in this case, it\n\nwas prety clear to me that Mr. Krischer did not want to prosecute\n\nthis case.\n\nOn May l, 2oo6, Reiter submited to Krischer probable cause affidavits and a case filing\npackage relating to Epstein, one of his personal assistants, and a young local woman whom Epstein\nfirst victimized and then used to recruit other girls. In his transmital leter, which was later made\npublic, Reiter criticized Krischer, noting that he found the State Atorney’s Office’s “treatment of\nthese cases [to be] highly unusual.”!© Reiter urged Krischer “to examine the unusual course that\nyour office’s handling of this mater has taken” and to consider disqualifying himself from\nprosecuting Epstein. !’\n\nWi. THE FBI AND THE USAO INVESTIGATE EPSTEIN, AND THE DEFENSE\n\nTEAM ENGAGES WITH THE USAO\n\nA. May 2oo6 — February 2oo7: The Federal Investigation Is Initiated, and the\n\nUSAO Opens a Case File\n\nIn early 2oo6, a West Palm Beach FBI Special Agent who worked closely with\nAUSA Ann Marie Villafafia on child exploitation cases—and who is referred to in this Report as\n“the case agent”—mentioned to Villafafia in “casual conversations” having learned that the PBPD\nwas investigating a wealthy Palm Beach man who recruited minors for sexual activity. The case\nagent told Villafafia that the PBPD had reached out to the FBI because the State Atorney’s Office\nwas considering either not charging the case or allouing the defendant to plead to a misdemeanor\nls Fla. Stat. § 9o5.27 (2oo7).\n\nl6 See Larry Keller, “Palm Beach chief focus of fire in Epstein case,” Palm Beach Post, Aug. l4, 2oo6.\nM7 As noted, Krischer generally declined in his OPR interview to explain his office’s prosecutive decisions;\nhouever, regarding allegations of favoritism to Epstein’s defense counsel, Krischer told OPR, “I just don’t play that\nway.”\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo434o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004341.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 44 of 349\ncharge. Villafafia suggested meeting with the PBPD, but the case agent explained that before\nformally presenting the case to the FBI, the PBPD wanted to see hou the State Atorney’s Office\ndecided to charge Epstein.\n\nl. The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'* At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his background.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the Detective expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.'? The Detective\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose relationship with the <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span>\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\nDetective told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the Detective acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The Detective died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo434l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004344.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 47 of 349\n4. Late July 2oo6: The State Indicts Epstein, and the USAO Moves\nForward with a Federal Investigation\n\nSeveral days after Villafafia spoke with Acosta and Sloman, on July l9, 2oo6, <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span>\nState Atorney Belohlavek presented the case to the state grand jury.~> Krischer told OPR that\n“the whole thing” was put before the grand jury. According to a statement made at the time by the\nState Atorney’s Office spokesman, the grand jury was presented with a list of charges from highest\nto louest, without a recommendation by the prosecutor, and deliberated with the prosecutor out of\nthe room.”* The state grand jury returned an indictment charging Epstein with one count of felony\nsolicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7, a felony under state law because\nit alleged three or more instances of solicitation.” The indictment did not identify the person or\npersons solicited and made no mention of the fact that Epstein had solicited minors.*® On July 23,\n2oo6, Epstein self-surrendered to be arrested on the indictment, but was not detained, and the\ncharges were made public.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she decided to move forward with the federal investigation at that\npoint because she believed the State Atorney’s Office would permit Epstein to enter a plea to a\nreduced misdemeanor charge and that once he entered a guilty plea, the Department’s Petite policy\nmight preclude a federal prosecution.”’ Villafafia told OPR that at the time, she “definitely\nbelieved that we were going to proceed to [a federal] indictment, assuming that ...we had\nsufficient evidence.”\neS Villafafia and the FBI obtained and examined records of the state grand jury proceeding, and Lourie reviewed\nthem. Because the grand jury records have not been ordered released publicly, OPR does not discuss their substance\nin this Report.\nat Larry Keller, “Police say lawyer tried to discredit teenage girls,” Palm Beach Post, July 29, 2oo6, citing\nstatement by State Atorney’s Office spokesman Michael Edmondson.\n28 Indictment in State v. Epstein, 2oo6CF9454AXX (July l9, 2oo6), atached as Exhibit l to this Report.\n26 In pertinent part, the state indictment read, “[B]etween the Ist day of August [2oo4] and October 3l, 2oo5,\n[Epstein] did solicit, induce, entice, or procure another to commit prostitution lewdness, or assignation, . . . on three\nor more occasions.” The l5-month time frame and lack of detail regarding the place or manner of the offense made\nit impossible to identify from the charging document which victim or victims served as the basis for the charge in the\nstate indictment. Belohlavek explained to OPR that the charge did not list specific victims so that she could go forward\nat trial with whichever victim or victims might be available and willing to testify at that time.\n27 The Petite policy is a set of guidelines used by federal prosecutors when considering whether to pursue federal\ncharges for defendants previously prosecuted for state or local offenses. The Constitution does not prohibit the federal\ngovernment from prosecuting defendants who have been charged, acquited, or convicted on state charges based on\nthe same criminal conduct. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing principle that the prohibition\nagainst double jeopardy does not apply to prosecutions brought by different sovereigns. See, e.g., Gamble v. United\nStates, 587 U.S. ___, l39 S. Ct. l96o, l966-67 (2ol9) (and cases cited therein); Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S.\nl87, l95 (l959) (and cases cited therein); and United States v. Lanza, 26o U.S. 377, 382 (l922). Nonetheless, to\nbeter promote the efficient use of criminal justice resources, the Department developed policies in l959 and l96o to\nguide federal prosecutors in the use of their charging discretion. See Chapter Two, Part Two, Section IT.A.2, for a\nmore detailed discussion of the Petite policy.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4344\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004357.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 6o of 349\n\nfor meetings was to cause delay, but “the people in my office either couldn’t see that or didn’t\nwant to see that,” perhaps because of “their lack of experience with these types of cases” or a\nmisguided belief “that [Epstein’s] atorneys would not engage in this behavior.” Villafafia told\nOPR that she “could not seem to get [her supervisors] to understand the seriousness of Epstein’s\nbehavior and the fact that he was probably continuing to commit the behavior, and that there was\na need to move with necessary speed.” Nonetheless, Villafafia folloued the guidance of her\nimmediate supervisor and did not send the email.\n\nLike Lourie, Menchel told OPR that he believed meeting with defense counsel was good\npractice. Menchel told OPR that he saw “no dounside” to hearing the defense point of view.\nDefense counsel might make a persuasive point “that’s actually going to change our mind,” or\nalternatively, present arguments the defense would inevitably raise if the case went forward, and\nMenchel believed it would be to the USAO’s advantage to learn about such arguments in advance.\nMenchel also told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia ever articulating a concern that Epstein was\ncontinuing to offend, and in Menchel’s view, Epstein was “already under a microscope, at least in\nFlorida,” and it would have been “the height of stupidity” for Epstein to continue to offend in those\ncircumstances.\n\nE. June 2oo7: Villafaia Supplements the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nWhile Villafafia’s supervisors were considering whether to go forward with the proposed\ncharges, Villafafia took additional steps to support them. On June l4, 2oo7, she supplemented the\nprosecution memorandum with an addendum addressing “credibility concerns” relating to one of\nthe victims. In the email transmiting the addendum to Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her\nimmediate supervisor, Villafafia reported, “another Jane Doe has been identified and interviewed,”\nand the “different strategies” about hou to structure the charges left Villafafia unsure whether “to\nmake . . . changes nou or wait until we have received approval of the current charging strategy.”\nThe addendum itself related to a particular victim referred to as the minor who “saw Epstein most\nfrequently” and who had allegedly engaged in sexual activity with both Epstein and an Epstein\n<span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span>. In the addendum, Villafafia identified documents she had found corroborating four\nseparate statements made by this victim.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that the only victim about whom any supervisor ever articulated\nspecific credibility issues was the victim discussed in the addendum. Lourie told OPR that he had\nno specific recollection of the addendum, but it was “reasonable” to assume that the addendum\naddressed one particular victim because no one had identified specific concerns relating to any\nother victim. Villafafia’s immediate supervisor similarly told OPR that to her recollection, the\ndiscussions about credibility issues were generic rather than tied to specific victims.\n\nF. The June 26, 2oo7 Meeting with Defense Counsel\n\nMenchel agreed to meet with defense counsel on June 26, 2oo7, communicating directly\nwith Sanchez about the arrangements. At Menchel’s instruction, on June l8, 2oo7, Villafafia sent\na leter to defense counsel identifying what she described as “the statutes under consideration.”””!\n3 Villafafia sent copies of this leter to both Menchel and Sanchez. Villafafia told OPR that she objected to\nsending this information to the defense. Although Menchel did not recall directing Villafafia to send the leter to\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4357\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004364.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 67 of 349\nMenchel could not recall who initially suggested a state plea, but noted to OPR that his\n\noun “emails . .. make clear that this course of action was ultimately decided by Alex Acosta.” He\nreferenced, among others, his May l4, 2oo7 email to Villafafia informing her that Acosta was\ndeciding hou he wanted to handle the case. Menchel surmised that a state resolution accomplished\ntwo things that Acosta viewed as important: first, it resolved any Petite policy concerns, and\nsecond, it afforded more flexibility in sentencing than a federal plea would have alloued. Menchel\ntold OPR that the state plea proposal did not reflect any minimization of Epstein’s conduct and\nthat any state plea would have been to an offense that required sexual offender registration. He\ntold OPR, “I don’t think anybody sat around and said, you knou, it’s not that big a deal. That was\nnot the reaction that I think anybody had from the federal side of this case.” Rather, Menchel said,\n“The concern was if we charge him [as proposed], there’s going to be a trial.”\n\nDe July 2oo7: Villafaia and Menchel Disagree about the Proposed State\n\nResolution\nVillafafia told OPR that she was angry when she received Menchel’s July email explaining\n\nthat he had proposed to Sanchez resolving the federal investigation through a state plea. In\nVillafafia’s view, the proposed state resolution “didn’t make any sense” and “did not correspond”\nto Department policy requiring that a plea offer reflect “the most serious readily provable\noffense.”® In her view, a plea to a state charge “obviously” would not satisfy this policy. Villafafia\nalso told OPR that in her view, the USAM required the USAO to confer with the investigative\nagency about plea negotiations, and Villafafia did not believe the FBI would be in favor of a state\nplea. Villafafia also believed the CVRA required atorneys for the government to confer with\nvictims before making a plea offer, but the victims had not been consulted about this proposal.\nVillafafia told OPR she had met with some of the victims during the course of the investigation\nwho had negative impressions of the State Atorney’s Office, and she believed that “sending them\nback to the State Atorney’s Office was not something” those victims would support.\n& This policy was set forth in a September 22, 2oo3 memorandum from then Atorney General John Ashcroft\nregarding “Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and Sentencing”\n(knoun as the “Ashcroft Memo”), which provided, in pertinent part:\n\n[I]n all federal criminal cases, federal prosecutors must charge and pursue the\n\nmost serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts\n\nof the case, except as authorized by an <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General, United States\n\nAtorney, or designated supervisory atorney in the limited circumstances\n\ndescribed belou. The most serious offense or offenses are those that generate the\n\nmost substantial sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, unless a mandatory\n\nminimum sentence or count requiring a consecutive sentence would generate a\n\nlonger sentence. A charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor has a good\n\nfaith doubt, for legal or evidentiary reasons, as to the Government’s ability readily\n\nto prove a charge at trial. Thus, charges should not be filed simply to exert\n\nleverage to induce a plea. Once filed, the most serious readily provable charges\n\nmay not be dismissed except to the extent permited [elsewhere in this\n\nMemorandum].\nSee also Chapter Two, Part Two, Section II.B.l.\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4364\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004366.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 69 of 349\nMenchel’s reply email began with a rebuke:\nBoth the tone and substance of your email are totally inappropriate\nand, in combination with other maters in the past, it seriously calls\nyour judgment into question.\nAs you well knou, the US Atorney has not even decided whether\nto go forward with a prosecution in this mater, thus you should have\nrespected his position before engaging in plea negotiations.\nAlong that same line, despite whatever contrary representations you\nmade to the agents in this mater, it was made clear to you by the US\nAtorney and the First <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> from the time when you were first\nauthorized to investigate Mr. Epstein that the office had concerns\nabout taking this case because of petit [sic] policy and a number of\nlegal issues. Despite being told these things, you prepared a pros\nmemo and indictment that included a definitive date for indictment.\nIt has come to my atention that you led the agents to believe that\nthe indictment of this mater was a foregone conclusion and that our\ndecision to put off that date and listen to the defense atorneys’\nconcerns is indicative of the office having second thoughts about\nindicting.

It\nwas an informal discussion and not in the nature of an official plea\noffer but rather a feeling out by both sides as to what it might take\nto resolve the mater. As you are also well aware, the only reason\nwhy this office even agreed to look into the Epstein mater in the\nfirst instance was because of concerns that the State had not done an\nadequate job in vindicating the victims’ rights. As you and the\nagents conceded, had Epstein been convicted of a felony that\nresulted in a jail sentence and sex offender status, neither the FBI\nnor our office ever would have interceded. You should also knou\nthat my discussion with Lilly Sanchez was made with the US\nAtorney’s full knouledge.

She disagreed, houever, with his representation about her initial meeting with Acosta\nand Sloman regarding the Epstein investigation, noting that Menchel had not been at that\nmeeting. Villafafia told OPR that no one had communicated to her the “concerns” Menchel\nmentioned, and she had not been given an opportunity to respond to those concerns.”\n\nA week later, Villafafia replied to Menchel’s email, reiterating her concerns about the\nprocess and that filing charges against Epstein was not moving forward:\n\nHi Mat -- My trial is over, so I nou have [ ] time to focus back on\n\nthis case and our e-mail exchange. There are several points in your\n6? Neither Menchel nor Villafafia could recall for OPR to what concerns they were referring. In commenting\non OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney noted that Acosta’s concerns were “the possibility that bringing a case with\nserious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal issues could result in an outcome that set back the development of\ntrafficking laws and result in an aggregate greater harm to trafficking victims.”\nob Menchel confirmed to OPR that he was not involved in the decision to initiate the federal investigation.\n69 Villafafia characterized Menchel’s email as “meant to intimidate” and told OPR that she felt “put in [her]\nplace” by him. She percetved that Menchel was making it clear that she should not “jump the chain of command.”\nMenchel, houever, asserted to OPR that Villafafia had a “history of resisting supervisory authority” that warranted.\nhis strong response.\n\n43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4367\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004369.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 72 of 349\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt of Epstein’s criminal culpability.\nLastly, I was not trying to “dictate” a meeting with the U.S. Atorney\nor anyone else.

She viewed Menchel’s\nmessage as a rejection of her request to make a presentation to Acosta, and she told OPR that even\nthough she regarded Sloman as a friend, she did not feel she could reach out even to him to raise\nher concerns.’! Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not “order” Villafafia to refrain from\nraising her concerns with Acosta, Sloman, or Lourie, and he did not believe his email to Villafafia\nforeclosed her from meeting with Acosta. Rather, “the context of this exchange is, she is running\nroughshod over the U.S. Atorney, and what I am saying to her is, there is a process. You’re not\nin charge of it. I’m not in charge of it. [Acosta’s] in charge of it.””, Acosta, who was apparently\nnot aware of Villafafia’s email exchange with Menchel, told OPR that from his perspective,\nVillafafia was not “frozen out” of the case and that he would have met with her had she asked him\ndirectly for a meeting.\nB. Villafana Atempts to Obtain the Computer Equipment Missing from\nEpstein’s Palm Beach Home, but the Defense Team Opposes Her Efforts\nAs the USAO managers considered in July 2oo7 hou to resolve the federal investigation,\none item of evidence they did not have available to assist in that decision was the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s home before the PBPD executed its search warrant. Although\nVillafafia took steps to obtain the evidence, defense counsel continued to oppose her efforts.\n» Menchel forwarded this email to Sloman.\n4 Villafafia told OPR that she later spoke to Menchel, asking Menchel to redirect Sanchez to Villafafia, but that\nMenchel responded it was not Villafafia’s “place” to tell him to whom he should direct communications.\n45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4369\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004370.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 73 of 349\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n2 In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span>, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

Acosta Decides on a Resolution That Includes a Two-Year Term of\nIncarceration\n\nThe next critical step in the development of the NPA was the decision to propose a two-\nyear term of imprisonment. Although presented to the defense as the “minimum” the USAO would\naccept, in actuality the two-year proposal became only the starting point for the negotiations, with\nthe result that the defense continued to chip away at it as the negotiations continued. The\ncontemporaneous emails make no mention of any rationale for the decision to propose two years\nas the government’s beginning negotiating position, and nobody with whom OPR spoke was able\nto recall hou the decision was made. As discussed belou, Acosta did offer OPR an explanation,\nbut OPR was unable to find contemporaneous evidence supporting it.”°\n\nWhile the defense was communicating its objections to the federal investigation to\nVillafafia, Lourie, Menchel, and Sloman, Villafafia continued moving touard filing charges. On\nJuly l9, 2oo7, the day after receiving Oosterban’s email supporting a potential prosecution,\nVillafafia emailed Lourie and Menchel seeking approval to take further investigative steps\nregarding three of Epstein’s assistants. Houever, Menchel directed Villafafia to “hold off... until\nwe decide what course of action we are going to take on [E]pstein which should happen next\nweek.” Menchel told OPR that he did not specifically recall why he asked Villafafia to wait, but\nhe assumed it was because Acosta was deciding what course of action to take on the case.\n\nOn Monday, July 23, 2oo7, Menchel submited a resignation notice to Acosta, stating that\nhe would be leaving the USAO effective August 6, 2oo7.77\n\nl. The July 26, 2oo7 Meeting in Miami\n\nEarly on the morning of Thursday, July 26, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Menchel that she was\npreparing a new draft indictment containing revisions he had suggested, including removal of all\nbut three of the “travel counts” and “a large number of [the] overt acts,” and the addition of overt\nacts and counts relating to two additional victims; she would not, houever, have the revised\nindictment ready in time “for our discussion today” at their 2:oo p.m. meeting. Menchel told OPR\nthat the fact that he had both proposed revisions to the indictment and also directed Villafafia to\ndelay the investigative steps involving the assistants indicated that he was “trying to do something”\nwith the case, but was waiting for Acosta to decide the “underlying issue” of whether to proceed\nwith federal charges.\n\nAcosta made that decision on or before July 26, 2oo7. On that afternoon, Villafafia met in\nMiami with Menchel. She told OPR that Sloman, as well as the FBI case agents and their\nsupervisors, were also present, with Lourie participating by telephone. Villafafia told OPR that\nshe expected that the meeting, requested by Menchel, would address the direction of the\ninvestigation. Houever, Villafafia told OPR that after everyone had assembled, Menchel entered\nthe room and stated that Acosta “has decided to offer a two-year state deal.” According to\nSee Section IV.D.2 in this Part.\na As early as May 4, 2oo7, Menchel had informed Acosta that he was intending to leave the USAO to enter\nprivate practice.\n\n48\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4372\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004382.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 85 of 349\nLILLY ANN SANCHEZ, Esq.\nAuGust 3, 2oo7\nPAGE 2\nPlease let us knou your client's decision by no later than August l7, I have conferred\nwith U.S. Atorney Acosta who has asked me to communicate that the two-year term of\nincarceration is a non-negotiable minimum to vindicate a federal interest, and, at this time,\nhe is not inclined to meet with counsel for Mr. Epstein.\nSincerely,\nR.

Marie Villafafia\n\nMenchel told OPR that in his view, the two-year sentence established a “floor” for\nnegotiations and if Epstein rejected the offer, subsequent offers would require him to accept more\njail time rather than less. Menchel told OPR that the USAO was “leaving our options open” by\nretaining the option of a federal plea because he thought the defense was “trying . . . to get him\ninto a federal penitentiary.” The leter’s deadline of August l7, 2oo7, for acceptance of the\ngovernment’s offer was intended to accommodate Villafafia’s request that the deadline provide\nher with enough time to go to New York, pursue investigative steps involving two of Epstein’s\nassistants, do witness interviews, and take additional legal steps to obtain Epstein’s computers if\nEpstein rejected the deal. Menchel told OPR he considered August l7 to be a firm deadline: “[I]f\nyou tell someone they have two weeks, it should be two weeks.” Menchel signed and sent the\nleter on Friday, August 3, 2oo7, which was his last day at the USAO before joining a private law\nfirm.”\n\nThe follouing Monday, August 6, 2oo7, Villafafia contacted Menchel by email at his new\nfirm to inquire whether the leter to Epstein’s counsel had gone out on Friday.

Leading to the Meeting with Defense Counsel, Investigative Steps Are\nPostponed, and the Defense Continues to Oppose Villafana’s Efforts to\nObtain the Computer Evidence\n\nOn August 8, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Acosta that she had spoken with Oosterban, who\nwas willing to join a meeting with the defense; although he could not do so in person until after\nAugust 2l, he was willing to participate by phone in order “to stay firm on our August l7th\ndeadline.” Villafafia also reiterated that she wanted to contact Epstein’s assistants in New York\nand to interview some of Epstein’s colleagues and former employees there. Noting that “there was\nsome concern about [taking the proposed investigative steps] while we are trying to negotiate a\nplea,” Villafafia asked Acosta for guidance. Lourie also emailed Acosta and Sloman, asking that\nthe USAO “stick to our deadline if possible.” Lourie pointed out that CEOS “has no approval\nauthority” and opined it was “a bit extreme to allou the defense to keep arguing this [case] to\ndifferent agencies.” Acosta replied, “This will end up [at the Department] anyhou, if we don’t\nmeet with them. I’d rather keep it here. Brin[g]ing [the Chief of CEOS] in visibly does so. If our\ndeadline has to slip a bit . . . it’s worth it.”\n\nAs aresult, the investigative steps were postponed. On August lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLourie inquiring whether she could “still go ahead” with the New York trip and whether she could\noppose Black’s request to stay the litigation concerning the government’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s computer equipment until after Acosta’s meeting with the defense team. Villafafia was\nreluctant to delay the litigation and reported to Lourie that agents recently had interviewed a girl\nwho began seeing Epstein at age l4 and who was photographed in the nude by an Epstein <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span>.\nOn August l3, 2oo7, Villafafia advised Black that the USAO was not willing to agree to a stay of\nthe litigation. Houever, Sanchez reached out to Lourie on August 22, 2oo7, and obtained his\nagreement to a joint request for a stay until the week after Acosta’s meeting with defense counsel,\nwhich was scheduled for September 7, 2oo7.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, in her opinion, the defense efforts to put off the litigation\nconcerning the computers was “further evidence of the importance of [this] evidence.”?’ Villafafia\nsuspected the computers contained evidence that “would have put this case completely to bed.”\na In context, Acosta appeared to mean that although he was not concerned about the Department reviewing the\nNPA or its terms, he did have concerns that the Department would decide the USAO should not have accepted the\ncase because of a lack of federal interest and might direct the USAO to end its involvement in the mater.\n\na Menchel told OPR, on the other hand, “there could be a lot of reasons why” defense counsel would resist\n“turn[ing] over an entire computer.”\n6o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4384\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004386.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 89 of 349\nVillafafia added that the PBPD Chief had alerted the FBI that an upcoming news article would\nreport that Epstein was “going to plead to a state charge” and the PBPD Chief “wanted to knou if\nthe victims had been consulted about the deal.” Sloman forwarded Villafafia’s email to Acosta\nwith a note that read simply, “fyi.”\n\nLater that evening, Villafafia circulated to Sloman, Lourie, and Oosterban two alternative\ndocuments: a draft federal plea agreement and a draft NPA.'”° The draft federal plea agreement,\nfollouing the USAO’s standard format, called for Epstein to plead guilty to a five-year conspiracy\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 37l to entice minors to engage in prostitution, an offense requiring registration\nas a sexual offender, with a Rule ll(c) binding sentence of two years’ imprisonment. The draft\nNPA contained the terms presented to the defense team on July 3l, 2oo7, and called for Epstein to\nenter a state plea by September 28, 2oo7. Villafafia told OPR that because she had never seen a\nnon-prosecution agreement before, she relied on a template she found either using USAO or the\nDepartment’s internal online resources, but she did not do any additional research regarding the\nuse of non-prosecution agreements. !°!\n\n3. September 7, 2oo7: Acosta, Other USAO Atorneys, and FBI\nSupervisors Meet with Epstein Atorneys Starr, Lefkouitz, and\nSanchez\n\nOn Friday, September 7, 2oo7, Acosta, Sloman, Villafafia, Villafafia’s co-counsel,\nOosterban, and one or two supervisory FBI agents met at the USAO’s West Palm Beach office\nwith defense atorneys Sanchez and, for the first time, Starr and Lefkouitz.'°? This was Acosta’s\nfirst meeting with Epstein’s defense team. Villafafia understood the purpose of this meeting was\nto afford Epstein’s counsel an opportunity to “make a pitch” as to why the case should not be\nprosecuted federally. Villafafia recalled that at a “pre-meet” before defense counsel arrived,\nAcosta did not express concern about the viability of the prosecution or the strength of the case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that the meeting was not “‘a negotiation,” but a chance for the defense to\npresent their arguments, which were made by Starr and focused primarily on federalism. Villafafia\nsimilarly recalled that the meeting mainly consisted of the defense argument that the Epstein case\nshould remain a state mater in which the USAO should not interfere. Both Villafafia and her\nco-counsel recalled that Starr addressed himself directly to Acosta, and that Starr, who had held\nSenate-confirmed positions in the government, commented to Acosta that he and Acosta were “the\nonly people in this room who have run the [gantlet] of confirmation by the Senate.” Acosta did\nnot recall the comment, but he told OPR, “[B]Jack in July, we had decided that we were going\nChapter Three, the Department’s position at the time was that victim consultation was not required in maters in which\nthe government did not pursue a federal charge. The USAO’s actions with respect to victim consultation and the\nDepartment’s interpretation of the CVRA are discussed in detail in Chapter Three of this Report.\n\nloo The initial draft NPA is atached as Exhibit 2 to this Report.\nLO OPR was unable to identify a template upon which she might have relied.\nlo2 Lourie was not present. During September 2oo7, he was traveling between Florida and Washington, D.C.,\nas he transitioned to his new detail post as Principal Deputy <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General and Chief of Staff to the head\nof the Department’s Criminal Division, <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General Alice Fisher. He served in that detail until he left\nthe Department in February 2oo8.\n\n62\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4386\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004387.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 9o of 349\nforward, that either there is this pre-indictment resolution, or we go forward with an indictment.\nThe September meeting did not alter or shift our position.” !°°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that after hearing the defense argument, Acosta reiterated that the\nfederal interest in the case could be vindicated only by a state plea to an offense that required\nsexual offender registration, resulted in a two-year term of incarceration, and was subject to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 process for providing compensation to the victims. When defense counsel\nobjected to the registration requirement, Acosta held firm, and he also rejected the defense proposal\nfor a sentence of home confinement. In a subsequent email exchange with Criminal Division\nDeputy <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General Sigal Mandelker, who supervised CEOS, Oosterban reported\nthat the meeting was “non-eventful,” noting that defense counsel argued “federalism” and might\napproach Criminal Division <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General Alice Fisher to present that argument\ndirectly to her.\n\nVI. SEPTEMBER 2oo7: THE PLEA NEGOTIATIONS INTENSIFY, AND IN THE\n\nPROCESS, THE REQUIRED TERM OF IMPRISONMENT IS REDUCED\n\nAcosta had dispensed with the August l7, 2oo7 plea deadline specified in Menchel’s\nAugust 3, 2oo7 leter, in order to allou the defense to meet with him. After that meeting, and\nalthough Villafafia continued to plan to file charges on September 25, no new plea deadline was\nestablished, and the negotiations continued through most of September.\n\nThe defense used that time to push the USAO to make concessions. Because Acosta was\nnot willing to compromise on the issue of sexual offender registration or providing a means\nthrough which the victims could seek monetary damages, the negotiations focused on the term of\nimprisonment. As the contemporaneous emails shou, the USAO did not hold to its position that\na two-year term of imprisonment was “the minimum” that the USAO would accept. To reach an\nagreement with the defense on Epstein’s sentence, the USAO explored possible pleas in either\nfederal or state court, or both, and Villafafia spent considerable time and effort working with\ndefense counsel on developing alternative pleas with various outcomes. In the course of that\nprocess, the agreement was revised to require that Epstein accept a sentence of l8 months, with\nthe understanding that under the state’s sentencing procedures, he would likely serve just l5\nmonths.\n\nA. The Incarceration Term Is Reduced from 24 Months to 2o Months\n\nShortly after the September 7, 2oo7 meeting, Epstein atorney Gerald Lefcourt, who had\nnot been present at the meeting, spoke with both Acosta and Lourie, and made a new counteroffer,\nproposing that Epstein serve l5 months in jail folloued by l5 months in home confinement. On\nthe afternoon of Monday, September lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, identifying issues she\nwanted to discuss with him, including her concern that defense counsel was pushing for a\nresolution that would allou Epstein to avoid incarceration and possibly sexual offender\nregistration. Villafafia stated that Lefcourt’s counteroffer was “a reasonable counteroffer in light\nof our starting position of 24 months,” but added that it was “a really lou sentence.” Villafafia\nlo3 Sloman echoed this point, telling OPR that Starr’s presentation focused on the issue of federalism, but the\nUSAO had already decided to defer prosecution to the state and after the meeting, the USAO continued on that path.\n\n63\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4387\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004388.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 9l of 349\nnoted that the revised charges involved l9 victims, so the defense proposal for a l5-month sentence\namounted to less than one month per victim. Villafafia requested that “whatever the U.S. Atorney\ndecides to do,” the agreement with Epstein should “follou . .. a version of my writen non-\nprosecution agreement” in order to “avoid any state shenanigans and . . . keep the defense on a\nstrict timeline.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia circulated to Acosta and Sloman a revised NPA that called for a\n2o-month jail sentence to be folloued by lo months of home confinement. This redrafted NPA\ncontained a provision that specified, “With credit for gain time, Epstein shall serve at least\nl7 months in a state correctional institution.”'°* Acosta reviewed the revised NPA and amended\nit to include a statement clarifying that it was Epstein’s obligation “to undertake discussions with\nthe State of Florida to ensure compliance with these procedures.” Villafafia sent her version of the\nrevised NPA to Lefcourt that afternoon and forwarded Acosta’s proposed change to him the\nfollouing day, after she learned of it.\n\nOn September ll, 2oo7, the court contacted Villafafia to inquire whether the USAO would\nbe prepared to proceed with the litigation concerning the computers the follouing day. At\nSloman’s direction, Villafafia asked the court to delay the hearing, and the court rescheduled it for\nthe follouing week. At the same time, anticipating that plea negotiations would fail, Villafafia\ncirculated a revised indictment to her co-counsel and Oosterban, seeking their feedback before\nsending it “through the chain of command.” Villafafia also sent Oosterban the revised NPA and\ntold him she was “still shooting for 9/25” to bring charges, assuming the defense declined the\nUSAO’s offer. Oosterban responded, “The counter-offering is unfortunate, but I suppose it’s\nunderstandable.”!\n\nThat afternoon, Lourie asked Villafafia, “What is our latest offer?” Villafafia responded,\n“Plead to the three specified [state] charges, a 3o-month sentence, split 2o in jail and lo in\n‘community control,’ and agree that the girls are victims for purposes of damages. We also put in\ndeadlines for a plea and sentencing date.”\n\nB. September l2, 2oo7: The USAO and Defense Counsel Meet with the State\n\nAtorney\n\nAlthough the USAO and defense counsel had been discussing resolving the federal\ninvestigation with a plea to state charges, there is no evidence that the USAO involved the State\nAtorney’s Office in those discussions until September l2, 2oo7. On that day, Lourie, Villafafia,\nand another USAO supervisor who would be replacing Lourie as manager of the USAO’s West\nPalm Beach office, and Epstein atorneys Lefkouitz, Lefcourt, and Goldberger met with State\nAtorney Barry Krischer and <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek. Other than Villafafia,\nfew of the participants had any memory of the meeting or the results of it. The available evidence\nindicates that the USAO made additional concessions during the meeting.\nlos Through “gain time,” Florida inmates can earn a reduction in their sentence for good behavior.\n\nlo5 Oosterban told OPR that he did not recall having read the NPA at this juncture and “had no involvement\nwith it.”\n64\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4388\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004392.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 95 of 349\nD. The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “‘victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: harassment to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month recommendation, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding recommendation that he be sentenced to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of community control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be appointed\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”!!! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\nul The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4392\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004393.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 96 of 349\nto the assault charge” and suggesting a different factual scenario to support a federal charge.!’? At\nthis point, Sloman left on vacation, and he informed Acosta and Villafafia that in his absence\nLourie had agreed “to help finalize this.” Lourie spent the follouing work week at his new post\nat the Department in Washington, D.C., but communicated with his USAO colleagues by phone\nand email.\n\nIn a Sunday, September l6, 2oo7 email, Villafafia informed Lefkouitz that she had drafted\na factual proffer to accompany a revised “hybrid” federal plea proposal. In that email, Villafafia\nalso noted that she was considering filing charges in the federal district court in Miami, “which\nwill hopefully cut the press coverage significantly.” This email received considerable atention l2\nyears later when it was made public during the CVRA litigation and was viewed as evidence of\nthe USAO’s efforts to conceal the NPA from the victims. Villafafia, houever, explained to OPR\nthat she was concerned that news media coverage would violate the victims’ privacy. She told\nOPR, “[I]f [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into\nthe courthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper,” and that such publicity\nwas less likely to happen in Miami, where the press “in general does not care about what happens\nin Palm Beach.”\n\nLefkouitz responded to Villafafia with a revised version of her latest proposed “hybrid”\nplea agreement, in a document entitled “Agreement.” Significantly, this defense proposal\nintroduced two new provisions. The first related to four female assistants who had allegedly\nfacilitated Epstein in his criminal scheme. The defense sought a government promise not to\nprosecute them, as well as certain other unnamed Epstein employees, and a promise to forego\nimmigration proceedings against two of the female assistants:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also\n\nprecludes the initiation of any and all criminal charges which might\n\notherwise in the future be brought against [four named female\n\nassistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate\n\nentity] for any criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal\n\ninvestigation . . . . Further, no immigration proceeding will be\n\ninstituted against [two named female assistants] as a result of the\n\nongoing investigation.\n\nThe second new provision related to the USAO’s efforts to obtain Epstein’s computers:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement\n\nresolves any and all outstanding [legal process] that have requested\n\nwitness testimony and/or the production of documents and/or\n\ncomputers in relation to the investigation that is the subject of the\n\nAgreement. Each [legal process] will be withdrawn upon the\n\nexecution of the Agreement and will not be re-issued absent reliable\nM2 Villafafia told OPR that she sometimes used her home email account because “[n]egotiations were occurring\nat nights, on weekend[s], and while I was [away from the office for personal reasons], . . . and this occurred during a\ntime when out of office access to email was very limited.” Records shou her supervisors were aware that at times she\nused her personal email account in communicating with defense counsel in this case.\n\n69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4393\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004394.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 97 of 349\nevidence of a violation of the agreement. Epstein and his counsel\nagree that the computers that are currently under [legal process] will\nbe safeguarded in their current condition by Epstein’s counsel or\ntheir agents until the terms and conditions of the Agreement are\nfulfilled.\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a lengthy email to convey two options Lourie had\nsuggested: “the original proposal” for a state plea but with an agreement for an l8-month sentence,\nor pleas to state charges and two federal obstruction-of-justice charges. Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year conspiracy\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding recommendation for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\nsentenced in the state after he is sentenced in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be sentenced after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the resolution of all criminal liability, ‘and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she understood\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.!'?\n\nWith regard to immigration, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on immigration issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in connection with\ntheir immigration paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status. So there wasn’t any reason\nM3 OPR understood Villafafia’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry\ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to\ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4394\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004397.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page loo of 349\ntwelve months, with six served in home confinement, to run\nconsecutively.\n\nI just received an e-mail asking if Mr. Epstein could just do l2\nmonths imprisonment instead.\nAs you can see, Mr. Epstein is having second thoughts about doing\njail time.

When [Epstein] gets out, he has to plead to state\noffenses, including against minor, registrable, and then take one year house arrest/community\nconfinement.” By reply email, Villafafia asked Lourie to call her, but there is no record of whether\nthey spoke.\n\nF. Defense Counsel Offers New Proposals Substantially Changing the Terms of\n\nthe Federal Plea Agreement, which the USAO Rejects\n\nApproximately an hour after Lourie’s email reporting the deal he had reached with\nLefkouitz, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a revised draft plea agreement. Despite the agreement Lourie\nbelieved he and Lefkouitz had reached that morning, Lefkouitz’s proposal would have resulted\nin a l6-month federal sentence folloued by 8 months of supervised release served in the form of\nhome detention. Lefkouitz also inserted a statement in his proposal explicitly prohibiting the\nUSAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration authorities to institute immigration\nproceedings against two of Epstein’s female assistants.\n\nVillafafia circulated the defense’s proposed plea agreement to Lourie and two other\nsupervisors, and expressed frustration that the new defense version incorporated terms that were\n“completely different from what Jay just told Andy they would agree to.” Villafafia also pointed\nout that the defense “wants us to recommend an improper calculation” of the sentencing guidelines\nll8 The manager told OPR that he probably meant this as a joke because in his view the continued back-and-\nforth communications with defense counsel “was ridiculous,” and the only way to “get this deal done” might be to\nhave a direct conversation with Epstein.\n\n73\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4397\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004399.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lo2 of 349\nmessage, “That is fine. [The West Palm Beach manager] and I will nail everything doun, we just\nwant to get a final blessing.”\n\nNegotiations continued throughout the day on Wednesday, September l9, 2oo7, with\nVillafafia and Lefkouitz exchanging emails regarding the factual proffer for a plea and the\nscheduling of a meeting to finalize the plea agreement’s terms. During that exchange, Villafafia\nmade clear to Lefkouitz that the time for negotiating was reaching an end:\n\nI hate to have to be firm about this, but we need to wrap this up by\nMonday. I will not miss my [September 25 charging] date when this\nhas dragged on for several weeks already and then, if things fall\napart, be left in a less advantageous position than before the\nnegotiations. I have had an 82-page pros memo and 53-page\nindictment siting on the shelf since May to engage in these\nnegotiations. There has to be an ending date, and that date is\nMonday.\n\nEarly that afternoon, Lourie—who was participating in the week’s negotiations from his\nnew post at the Department in Washington, D.C.—asked Villafafia to furnish him with the last\ndraft of the plea agreement she had sent to defense counsel, and she provided him with the “l8/l2\nsplit” draft she had sent to Lefkouitz the prior afternoon. After reviewing that draft, Lourie told\nVillafafia it was a “[g]ood job” but he questioned certain provisions, including whether the\nUSAO’s agreement to suspend the investigation and hold all legal process in abeyance should be\nin the plea agreement. Villafafia told Lourie that she had added that paragraph at the “insistence”\nof the defense, and opined, “I don’t think it hurts us.” Villafafia explained to OPR that she held\nthis view because “Alex and people above me had already made the decision that if the case was\nresolved we weren’t going to get the computer equipment.”\n\nAt 3:44 p.m. that afternoon, Lefkouitz emailed a “redline” version of the federal plea\nagreement shouing his new revisions, and noted that he was “also working on a deferred [sic]\nprosecution agreement because it may well be that we cannot reach agreement here.” The defense\nredline version required Epstein to plead guilty to a federal information charging two misdemeanor\ncounts of atempt to intentionally harass a person to prevent testimony, the pending state\nindictment charging solicitation of prostitution, and a state information charging one count of\ncoercing a person to become a prostitute, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o4 (without regard\nto age). Neither of the proposed state offenses required sexual offender registration. Epstein\nwould serve an l8-month sentence and a concurrent 6o months on probation on the state charges.\nThe redline version again deleted the provisions relating to damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and\nreplaced it with the provision requiring creation of a trust administered by the state court. It\nretained language proposed by Villafafia, providing that the plea agreement “resolves the federal\ncriminal liability of the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida\ngrouing out of any criminal conduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this\nplea agreement,” but also re-inserted the provision promising not to prosecute Epstein’s assistants\nand the statement prohibiting the USAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration\nproceedings.

Acosta Edits the Federal Plea Agreement, and Villafana Sends a Final Version\n\nto the Defense\n\nThe next day, Thursday, September 2o, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney\nBelohlavek and informed her:\n\nOur deadline is Monday evening for a signed agreement and\narraignment in the federal system. At this time, things don’t look\npromising anyway, but I will keep you posted. In their latest draft,\nthey changed what they agreed to plead to in the state from\nsolicitation of minors for prostitution (a registrable offense) to\nforcing adults into prostitution (a non-registrable offense). We will\nnot budge on this issue, so it is looking unlikely that we will reach a\nmutually acceptable agreement. If that changes, I will let you knou.\n\nAcosta sent Lourie “[s]ome thoughts” about the USAO version of the proposed “hybrid”\nfederal plea agreement he had received from Lourie the evening before, commenting that “it seems\nvery straightforward” and “we are not changing our standard charging language” for the\ndefense.!?° Noting that the draft was prepared for his signature, Acosta told Lourie that he did not\ntypically sign plea agreements and “this should not be the first,” adding that the USAO “should\nonly go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement.” !*! Lourie forwarded the email\nto Villafafia with a transmital message simply reading, “I think Alex’s changes are all good ones.\nPlease try to incorporate his suggestions, change the signature block to your name and send as\nfinal to Jay.” Lourie also noted to Acosta and Villafafia that he believed the defense would want\nto go back to the initial offer of a state plea with a non-prosecution agreement. When Villafafia\nsent the revised plea agreement to Lefkouitz later that afternoon, she advised him that if the\ndefense wanted to return to the original offer of a state plea only, the draft NPA she had sent to\nhim on September l7, 2oo7, would control.\n\nl2o The USAO had standard federal plea agreement language, from which this “hybrid” plea agreement had\nsubstantially diverged.\n\nVl The standard procedure was for documents such as plea agreements to be signed by an AUSA under the\nname of the U.S. Atorney. In his OPR interview, Acosta further explained that wanted to give “the trial team” an\nopportunity to voice any objections because “if it’s something they don’t feel comfortable with we . . . shouldn’t go\nforward with it.”\n\n77\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004403.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lo6 of 349\n\nI think Jay [Lefkouitz] will try to talk you out of a registrable\noffense. Regardless of the merits of his argument, in order to get us\ndoun in time they made us an offer that included pleading to an\noffense against a minor (encouraging a minor into prostitution) and\ntouted that we should be happy because it was registrable. For that\nreason alone, I don’t think we should consider allouing them to\ncome doun from their oun offer, either on this issue or on time of\nincarceration.\n\nLefkouitz atempted to reach Acosta that night, but Acosta directed Villafafia to return the\ncall, and told Lourie that he did not want to open ‘“‘a backchannel” with defense counsel. Lourie\ninstructed Villafafia, “U can tell [JJay that [A]lex will not agree to a nonregistration offense.”\n\nOn the morning of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Acosta informing him\nthat “it looks like we will be [filing charges against] Mr. Epstein on Tuesday,” reporting that the\ncharging package was being reviewed by the West Palm Beach manager, and asking if anyone in\nthe Miami office needed to review it. Villafafia also alerted Lourie that she had spoken that\nmorning to Lefkouitz, who “was waffling” about Epstein pleading to a state charge that required\nsexual offender registration, and she noted that she would confer with Krischer and Belohlavek\n“to make sure the defense doesn’t try to do an end run.”\n\nThat same morning, Epstein atorney Sanchez, who had not been involved in negotiations\nfor several weeks, emailed Sloman, advising, “[I] want to finalize the plea deal and there is only\none issue outstanding and [I] do not believe that [A]lex has read all the defense submissions that\nwould assist in his determination on this point . . . [U]pon resolution, we will be prepared to sign\nas soon as today.” From his out-of-toun vacation, Sloman forwarded the email to Acosta, who\nreplied, “Enjo[y] vacation. Working with [M]arie on this.” Sloman also forwarded Sanchez’s\nemail to Lourie and asked, “Do you knou what she’s talking about?” Lourie responded that\nSanchez “has not been in any negotiations. Don’t even engage with yet another cook.”\n\nJ. The USAO Agrees Not to Criminally Charge “Potential Co-Conspirators”\n\nLefkouitz, in the meantime, sent Villafafia a revised draft NPA that proposed an l8-month\nsentence in the county jail, folloued by l2 months of community control, and restored the\nprovision for a trust fund for disbursement to an agreed-upon list of individuals “who seek\nreimbursement by filing suit pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 2255.” This defense draft retained the\nprovision promising not to criminally charge Epstein’s four female assistants and unnamed\nemployees of the specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity, but also extended the provision to “any\npotential co-conspirators” for any criminal charge arising from the ongoing federal investigation.\nThis language had evolved from similar language that Villafafia had included in the USAO’s\nearlier proposed draft federal plea agreement.!?? Lefkouitz also again included the sentence\nl22 The language in the USAO’s draft federal plea agreement stated, “This agreement resolves the federal\ncriminal liability of the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any\ncriminal conduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO]... .”\n\n79\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004404.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lo7 of 349\nprecluding the government from requesting, initiating, or recommending immigration proceedings\nagainst the two assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAt this point, Lefkouitz again sought to speak to Acosta, who replied by email: “I am\nhappy to talk. My caveat is that in the middle of negotiations, u try to avoid[] undermining my\nstaff by allouing ‘interlocutor[]y’ appeals so to speak so I’d want [M]arie on the call[.] I'll have\nher set something up.”\n\nVillafafia sent to Lefkouitz her oun revised NPA, telling him it was her “atempt at\ncombining our thoughts,” but it had not “been approved by the office yet.” She inserted solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, a registrable offense, as the charge to which Epstein would\nplead guilty; proposed a joint recommendation for a 3o-month sentence, divided into l8 months\nin the county jail and l2 months of community control; and amended the § 2255 provision.'”3\nVillafafia’s revision retained the provision suspending the investigation and holding all legal\nprocess in abeyance, and she incorporated the non-prosecution provision while slightly altering it\nto apply to “any potential co-conspirator of Epstein, including” the four named assistants, and\ndeleting mention of the corporate entity employees. Finally, Villafafia deleted mention of\nimmigration proceedings, but advised in her transmital email that “we have not and don’t plan to\nask immigration” proceedings to be initiated. !74\n\nLater that day, Villafafia alerted Lourie (who had arrived in Florida from Washington, D.C.\nearly that afternoon) and the new West Palm Beach manager (copying her first-line supervisor and\nco-counsel) that she had included language that defense counsel had requested “regarding\npromises not to prosecute other people,” and commented, “I don’t think it hurts us.” There is no\ndocumentation that Lourie, the West Palm Beach manager, or anyone else expressed disagreement\nwith Villafafia’s assessment. Rather, within a few minutes, Villafafia re-sent her email, adding\nthat defense counsel was persisting in including an immigration waiver in the agreement, to which\nLourie responded, “No way. We don’t put that sort of thing in a plea agreement.” Villafafia replied\nto Lourie, indicating she would pass that along to defense counsel and adding, “Any other\nthoughts?” When Lourie gave no further response, Villafafia informed defense counsel that Lourie\nhad rejected the proposed immigration language.\n\nOPR questioned the subjects about the USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Lourie did not recall why the USAO agreed to it, but he speculated that he left\nthat provision in the NPA because he believed at the time that it benefited the government in some\nway. In particular, Lourie conjectured that the promise not to prosecute “any potential\nco-conspirators” protected victims who had recruited others and thus potentially were\nco-conspirators in Epstein’s scheme. Lourie also told OPR, “TI bet the answer was that we weren’t\ngoing to charge” Epstein’s accomplices, because Acosta “didn’t really want to charge Epstein” in\nl23 Villafafia noted that she had consulted with a USAO employee who was a “former corporate counsel from a\nhospital” about the § 2255 language, and thought that the revised language “addresses the concern about having an\nunlimited number of claimed victims, without me trying to bind girls who I do not represent.”\n\nl4 Villafafia gave OPR an explanation similar to that given by the case agents—that an ICE Special Agent had.\nbeen involved in the early stages of the federal investigation of Epstein, and Villafafia believed the agent knew two of\nEpstein’s female assistants were foreign nationals and would have acted appropriately on that information. Villafafia\nalso said that the USAO generally did not get involved in immigration issues.\n8o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004410.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll3 of 349\nit had identified as victims.'°!

The USAO had no objection to Epstein self-reporting\nto begin serving his sentence by January 4, 2oo8.\n\nImmunity: The USAO would not initiate criminal charges against “any potential\nco-conspirator of Epstein,” including four named personal assistants.\n\nOther: Epstein was obligated to undertake discussions with the State Atorney’s\nOffice to ensure compliance with this agreement.\n\nEpstein waived his right to appeal.\n\nEpstein agreed that he would not be afforded any benefits with respect to\ngain time or other rights, opportunities, and benefits not available to any\nother inmate.\n\nThe federal investigation would be suspended and all pending legal process\nheld in abeyance unless and until Epstein violated any term of the\nagreement. Evidence “requested by or directly related to” the pending legal\nprocess, “including certain computer equipment,” would be kept inviolate\nuntil all the NPA terms had been satisfied.\n\nBreach: The USAO would be required to notify Epstein of any alleged breach of the\nagreement within 9o days of the expiration of the term of home\nconfinement, and would be required to initiate prosecution within 6o days\nthereafter.\n\nDisclosure: The parties “anticipate[d]” that the agreement would not be made part of\nany public record, and if the USAO received a Freedom of Information Act\nrequest or compulsory process commanding disclosure of the agreement, it\nwould provide notice to Epstein before making any disclosure. !*\n\nThat evening, Lefkouitz emailed Lourie to express concern about the notification he\nunderstood would be given to Chief Reiter, stating, “I am very concerned about leaks unduly\nprejudicing Jeffrey [Epstein] in the media.”!°?

Epstein Further Delays His Guilty Plea\n\nThe addendum did not bring the case to conclusion. Instead, the mater entered a new,\nprotracted phase, which involved the upper echelons of the Department of Justice. Despite the\nfact that Epstein and his atorneys had signed the NPA, they pursued a new strategy of appealing\nto senior Department managers with the goal of seting aside the NPA entirely. Although\nultimately unsuccessful, the strategy delayed the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea by months.\n\nOn October 29, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, raising several issues that she wanted\nSloman to address with Lefkouitz. Among other things, Villafafia pointed out that the NPA\nrequired Epstein to use his “best efforts” to comply with the agreement, but he had failed to comply\nwith the timeline established by the NPA when he sought and obtained a plea hearing\npostponement from October 26 to November 2o. Responding to Lefkouitz’s atempts to limit the\nUSAO’s communications with various entities and individuals, Villafafia noted that the USAO\nneeded to be able to communicate with the State Atorney’s Office and the victims’ atorney “to\n[e]nsure that Epstein is abiding by the terms of the agreement.”\n\nThat same day, <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney Belohlavek informed Sloman that the state judge\nassigned to the case had scheduled Epstein’s plea and sentence in early January 2oo8. Belohlavek\nassured Sloman that the “plea and sentence will definitely occur before the January 4th date that\nwas agreed on by all for the sentencing.”'“? Nonetheless, emails over the course of the next month\nshou that the USAO, the State Atorney’s Office, and defense counsel continued to communicate\nregarding the date of the guilty plea, with the USAO asserting that a proposed January 7, 2oo8\ndate for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea was “unacceptable,” while the defense contended that\nEpstein had not agreed to any date. Finally, after multiple communications referring to various\npotential dates, on December 7, 2oo7, Epstein atorney Jack Goldberger issued a Notice of\nHearing, seting the case for January 4, 2oo8.!°°\n\nE. Epstein Seeks Departmental Review of the NPA’s § 2255 Provision Relating to\n\nMonetary Damages for the Victims\n\nWith Epstein’s plea hearing delayed, he launched a new effort to undermine the validity of\nthe NPA, this time within the Department. On November l6, 2oo7, Epstein atorney Kenneth Starr\ncalled the office of <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General for the Criminal Division Alice Fisher and left a\nmessage that he was calling regarding Epstein.'*!

In his leter, Starr\nargued that the USAO improperly had compelled Epstein to agree to pay civil damages under\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 as part of a state-based resolution of a criminal case. On the same day, Lefkouitz\nemailed Sloman, complaining about the USAO’s plan to notify victims about the § 2255 provision\nand alerting Sloman that Epstein’s counsel were seeking a meeting with the <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney\nGeneral “to address what we believe is the unprecedented nature of the section 2255 component”\nof the NPA. After Lourie sent to Sloman a copy of the Starr leter, Sloman forwarded it to\nVillafafia, asking her to prepare a chronology of the plea negotiations and hou the § 2255 provision\nevolved. Villafafia responded that she was “going through all of the ways in which they have tried\nto breach the agreement to convince you guys to let me indict.”\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Lourie consulted with CEOS Chief Oosterban, asking for his\nthoughts on defense counsel’s arguments. At the same time, at Lourie’s request, Villafafia sent\nthe NPA and its addendum to Lourie and Oosterban. Oosterban responded to Lourie that he was\n“not thrilled” about the NPA; described Epstein’s conduct as unusually “egregious,” particularly\nbecause of its serial nature; and observed that the NPA was “prety advantageous for the defendant\nand not all that helpful to the victims.” He opined, houever, that the <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General\nwould not and should not consider or address the NPA “other than to say that she agrees with it.”\nDuring her OPR interview, Fisher did not recall reading Starr’s leter or discussing it with\nOosterban, but believed the comment about her “agree[ing] with it” referred to a federal\nprosecution of Epstein, which she believed was appropriate. She told OPR, houever, that she\n“played no role in” the NPA and did not review or approve the agreement either before or after it\nwas signed.\n\nAs set forth in more detail in Chapter Three of this Report, Villafafia planned to notify the\nvictims about the NPA and its § 2255 provision, as well as about the state plea hearing, and she\nprovided a draft of the notification leter to Lefkouitz for comments. On November 29, 2oo7,\nLefkouitz sent Acosta a leter complaining about the draft notification to the victims. Lefkouitz\nasked the USAO to refrain from notifying the victims until after defense counsel met with <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span>\nAtorney General Fisher, which he anticipated would take place the follouing week. Internal\nemails indicate that Lourie contacted Oosterban about his availability for a meeting with Starr,\nbut both Fisher and Lourie told OPR that such a meeting never took place, and OPR found no\nevidence that it did.\n\nAcosta promptly responded to Lefkouitz by leter, directing him to raise his concerns about\nvictim notification with Villafafia or Sloman. Acosta also addressed Epstein’s evident efforts to\nstop the NPA from being enforced:\n\nl52 In a short email to Fisher, the next day, Lourie reported simply: “He was very nice.

The defense team included Starr,\nDershouitz, Lefcourt, and Boston atorney Martin Weinberg. The USAO side included Acosta,\nSloman, Villafafia, and another senior AUSA, with the Miami FBI Special Agent in Charge and\n<span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Special Agent in Charge also present. In addition to previously raised arguments, during\nthis meeting, Epstein’s atorneys raised a new argument—that the state charge to which Epstein\nhad agreed to plead guilty did not apply to the facts of the case.\n\n3. The Defense Notifies Acosta That It May Pursue a Department Review\nof the USAO’s Actions\n\nShortly after the December l4, 2oo7 meeting, Lefkouitz notified Acosta that if the issues\nraised at the meeting could not be resolved promptly, the defense team may “have no alternative\nbut to seek review in Washington.” Acosta notified <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General Fisher that the\ndefense team might make an appeal to her, and he asked her to grant such a request for review and\n“to in fact review this case in an expedited manner [in order] to preserve the January 4th plea date.”\nStarr and Lefkouitz then sent to Acosta a lengthy leter, with numerous previously submited\ndefense submissions, reviewing issues discussed at the meeting, and advising that Epstein sought\na “prompt, independent, expedited review” of the evidence by “you or someone you trust.” The\nleter reiterated Epstein’s position that his conduct did not amount to a registrable offense under\nstate law or a violation of federal law, and with respect to the NPA’s § 2255 provision, that it was\n“improper” to require Epstein to pay damages “‘to individuals who do nothing but simply assert a\nclaim” under the statute.\n\nl56 As <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General Fisher’s Chief of Staff, Lourie had informed Starr that Fisher hoped Starr\nwould speak to Acosta to “resolve the[] fairly narrou issues” raised in Starr’s correspondence with Acosta.

As soon became apparent, Acosta was unable to achieve\nan expedited review so that Epstein could plead guilty and be sentenced by\nJanuary 4, 2oo8, and the plea and sentencing date was rescheduled. On January 2, 2oo8, Sloman\nspoke with <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney Belohlavek, who confirmed that the change of plea hearing\nhad been postponed. In an email reporting this to Acosta and Villafafia, Sloman said that Epstein’s\nlocal defense atorney Goldberger had told Belohlavek the postponement was because the facts\n“did not fit the proposed state charge,” and that Belohlavek told Sloman she agreed with that\nassessment.’ The next day, Villafafia sent to Acosta and Sloman a local newspaper article\nreporting that Epstein’s state plea hearing was reset for March and in exchange for it the federal\nauthorities would drop their investigation of him. Acosta also sent to Sloman and Villafafia an\nemail memorializing a statement made to him by Lefkouitz in a phone call that day: “‘I\n[Lefkouitz] may have made a mistake 6 months ago. [Belohlavek] told us solicitation [is] not\nregistrable. It turns out that the actual offense charged is.’”!°°\n\n5. January 7, 2oo8: Acosta and Sloman Meet with Sanchez, Who Makes\nAdditional Allegations of USAO Misconduct\n\nOn January 7, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman met with defense atorney Sanchez at her request.\nAccording to meeting notes made by Sloman, among other things, Sanchez alleged that the\nUSAO’s media spokesperson had improperly disclosed details of the Epstein case to a national\nnews reporter, and Sanchez “suggested that the USAO could avoid any potential ugliness in DC\nby agreeing to a watered-doun resolution for Epstein.” After Acosta excused himself to atend\nanother meeting and Sloman refused to speak further with Sanchez “without a witness present,”\nshe left. Later that day, Acosta and Sloman spoke by phone with Starr, Lefkouitz, and Sanchez,\nwho expressed concern about the “leak” to the news media, reiterated their objections to the NPA,\nand pressed for the ‘“‘watered-doun resolution,” which they specified would mean allouing Epstein\nto plead to a charge of coercion instead of procurement, avoid serving time in jail, and not register\nas a sexual offender. A note in the margin of Sloman’s handwriten notes of the conversation\nreads: “We’re back to where we started in September.”\n\nThat evening, Villafafia expressed concern that the delay in resolving the mater was\naffecting the USAO’s ability to go forward with a prosecution should Epstein renege on his\nagreement, and she outlined for Acosta and Sloman the steps she proposed to take while Epstein\nwas pursuing Departmental review. Those steps included re-establishing contact with victims,\ninterviewing victims in New York and one victim who lived in a foreign country, making contact\nwith “potential sources of information” in the Virgin Islands, and re-initiating proceedings to\nobtain Epstein’s computers.\n\nIn the meantime, USAO Criminal Division Chief Robert Senior performed a “soup to nuts”\nreview of the Epstein investigation, reviewing the indictment package and all of the evidence\nVillafafia had compiled. He told OPR that he could not recall the reason for his review, but opined\nl5? Belohlavek told OPR that she did not recall this incident, but she noted that the PBPD report did set forth\nfacts supporting the charge of procurement of a minor.\n\nl6o Although the meeting Lefkouitz had with Lourie, Villafafia, Krischer, and Belohlavek to discuss the state\nresolution was only four months prior, not six, Lefkouitz’s reference was likely to the September l2, 2oo7 meeting.\nlol\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4425\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004428.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l3l of 349\nrene eae Office of the Deput\nCriminal Division z ole\nAtorney General\nAlice Fisher Mark Filip\n<span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney Deputy Atorney\nGeneral General\nAndrew Lourie * John Roth\nPrincipal Deputy Senior Associate\n<span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney Deputy Atorney\nGeneral General\nSigal Mandelker\nDeputy <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span>\nAtorney General\nAndrew\nOosterban\nChief, CEOS\nA.

Sloman emailed Lefkouitz that CEOS was\n“ready to proceed immediately” with a review of the mater. Sloman advised Lefkouitz that “in\nthe event CEOS decides that a federal prosecution should not be undertaken against Mr. Epstein,\nthis Office will close its investigation,” but that, “should CEOS disagree with Mr. Epstein’s\nposition, Mr. Epstein shall have one week to abide by [the NPA].” Sloman forwarded this email\nto Villafafia, who responded, “Why would we possibly let him keep the same deal after all he has\nput us through? And after we have discovered 6 new girls... .”\n\nThe defense soon signaled that the CEOS review would not end Epstein’s requests for the\nDepartment’s involvement. On February 29, 2oo8, Lefkouitz requested a defense meeting with\nOosterban on March l2, 2oo8.'° Starr spoke to <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General Fisher and “made it\nclear that [the defense team would] want an audience with her if [CEOS] decid[ed] to support the\nprosecution.” On March 6, 2oo8, Acosta alerted Sloman and Oosterban that Starr and Lefkouitz\nhad called him to express “concern” about Oosterban’s participation in the case, and indicated\nthat “they may ask for more senior involvement.” Acosta “informed them that they certainly had\nthe right to ask whomever they wanted for whatever they thought appropriate, and that whatever\nprocess would be given them was up to whomever they asked.”\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz folloued up with Acosta in an email:\n\nWe appreciate that you will afford us as much time as Main Justice\n\ndetermines is appropriate for it to conduct a review of this mater.\n\nAs you have suggested, we will initiate that review process with\n\nDrew Oosterban, and engage in a discussion with him about all of\n\nthe facts and circumstances, as well as the legal and policy issues\n\nassociated with this case... .

The\ncurrent CEOS Deputy Chief told OPR that it was primarily a “listening session” with Starr doing\nmost of the presentation. Oosterban told OPR that he recalled “some back and forth” because the\ndefense team was saying “some outrageous things.” Both Oosterban and his Deputy Chief were\ndisturbed that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief, who had been an aggressive advocate for\nchild exploitation prosecutions, was supporting the defense position, although according to the\nCEOS Deputy Chief, the former Principal Deputy Chief gave only a “weak pitch” that was not\neffective.\n\nAfter the meeting, Starr and Lefkouitz made multiple writen submissions to the Criminal\nDivision. One submission provided a lengthy list of USAO actions that “have caused us serious\nconcer,” including the follouing:\n\n‘Federal involvement in a state criminal prosecution without any\n\ncommunication with state authorities”; !*\n\nthe issuance of legal process and document requests for items that\n\n“had no connection to the conduct at issue”;\n\nthe nomination “of an individual closely associated with one of the\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> United States Atorneys involved in this case” to serve as\n\nthe victims’ atorney representative;\n\nthe “insistence” on a victim notification leter inviting the victims to\n\nmake sworn statements at Epstein’s sentencing; and\n\nthe purported existence of a “relationship” between Sloman and a\n\nlaw firm representing several of the alleged victims in civil suits\n\nagainst Epstein.'®\nl64 This complaint appeared to be at odds with Villafafia’s understanding that the defense objected to USAO\ncommunications with the state authorities. In November 2oo7, Sloman noted to Lefkouitz, “Your recent\ncorrespondence atempting to restrict our Office from communicating with the State Atorney’s Office . . . raises\nconcern.” In a March 2oo8 email reporting to CEOS about the state case, Villafafia noted that she did not knou\nwhether a state “misdemeanor deal [was] back on the table because the defense demanded that we have no contact\nwith the State Atorney’s Office, so I haven’t spoken with the [<span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney] in over 6 months.” Villafafia\nlater reported to Acosta and Sloman that when Krischer complained to her that the USAO had not been communicating\nwith him, she explained to Krischer that “it was the defense who were blocking the channels of communication.”\n\nl65 In approximately 2ool, Sloman briefly left the USAO and for a few months was in private practice with a\nMiami atorney, whose practice specialized in plaintiffs’ sexual abuse claims.

Finally, in a leter to <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General Fisher on\nMay l4, 2oo8, Starr thanked her for having spoken with him the previous day, reiterated the\ndefense team’s various complaints, and asked her to meet with him, Lefkouitz, and Whitley.\n\nMeanwhile, Oosterban’s Deputy Chief drafted a decision leter to be sent from Oosterban\nto Lefkouitz, and over the course of several weeks, it was reviewed by and received input from\nDeputy <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General Mandelker and <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General Fisher, as well as\nthe Criminal Division’s Appellate Section (regarding certain legal issues) and Office of\nEnforcement Operations (regarding the Petite policy).

The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\ndiscretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.””’ Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel application” of relevant federal statutes;'°° (2) CEOS’s conclusion that\nfederal prosecution would not be “an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an endorsement” of the\ncase;!®’ (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims. The Epstein defense team alleged in the leter that Sloman’s past association with the\natorney caused Sloman to take actions to favor victims’ potential civil lawsuits against Epstein.\n\nl66 Oosterban’s leter stated, “Mr. Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution\neven though it might involve a novel application of a federal statute.” This statement referred to a defense argument\nbased on a prior Departmental expression of concern about a Congressional proposal to expand federal law to “adult\nprostitution where no force, fraud or coercion was used.” Oosterban stated that “the Department’s efforts are properly\nfocused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children”—even if wholly local—and “the exploitation of adults\nthrough force, fraud, or coercion.” He then observed that the fact “that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look\nprecisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive.”\n\nl67 Oosterban began his leter, houever, by making it clear that CEOS had considered “the narrou question as\nto whether there is a legitimate basis for the U.S. Atorney’s Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of\nMr. Epstein.”\n\nlo7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo443l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004435.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l38 of 349\n\nThe next day, Villafafia asked Goldberger to change the plea agreement by inserting the\nword “imprisoned” after “6 months,” and Goldberger agreed to do so. Villafafia, houever, did not\nask that the agreement be amended to clarify that the reference to “the Palm Beach County\nDetention Facility” meant the jail, rather than the Stockade. The final signed plea agreement form\nfurther clarified the sentence, providing that after serving l2 months in the Palm Beach County\nDetention Facility, Epstein would be “sentenced to 6 months in the Palm Beach County Detention\nFacility . . . to be served consecutive to the l2 month sentence,” folloued by “l2 months\nCommunity Control.” The word “imprisoned” was hand writen after “6 months” but then crossed\nout and replaced by “jail sentence.”!”\n\nA. June 3o, 2oo8: Epstein Enters His Guilty Pleas in State Court\n\nEpstein, with his atorney Jack Goldberger, appeared in Palm Beach County court on\nJune 3o, 2oo8, and entered guilty pleas to the indictment charging him with one felony count of\nsolicitation of prostitution and to a criminal information charging him with one felony count of\nprocurement of a minor to engage in prostitution.'”4 At the plea hearing, which Villafafia and the\nFBI case agent atended as spectators, <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney Belohlavek did not proffer the facts\nof the case; instead she only recited the charging language in the indictment and the criminal\ninformation:\n\n[B]etween August l, 2oo4 and October 3l, 2oo5, the defendant in\n\nPalm Beach County did solicit or procure someone to commit\n\n[prostitution] on three or more occasions.

As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the\nchoice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as\nincompetence, corruption, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may\nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a conviction, if the prior\nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a\nsubstantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and restitution as well as\nimprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal\nprosecution.”\n\n(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal\noffense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and\nsustain a conviction.\n\nHouever, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a\nfederal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed\nprosecution.\n\nThe Petite policy cautions that whenever a mater involves overlapping federal and state\njurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most\nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests\ninvolved.” If a substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular\nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the mater to the appropriate <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General\nfor resolution. Prior approval from the appropriate <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General must be obtained\nbefore bringing a prosecution governed by this policy.\n\n3. USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve an investigation or pending case through a\nplea agreement. USAM §§ 9-27.33o; 9-27.4oo. Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned\nby Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).!°3 Regardless of whether the plea agreement is\noffered pre-charge or post-charge, the prosecutor’s plea bargaining “must honestly reflect the\ntotality and seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.” USAM § 9-27.4oo, comment.!°4 The\nimportance of selecting a charge that reflects the seriousness of the conduct is echoed in USAM\n§ 9-27.43o, which directs the prosecutor to require a defendant to plead to an offense that\nrepresents the most serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the\nl28 As previously noted, Rule ll(c)(l)(C) permits the parties to agree to resolve the case in exchange for a\nspecific sentence, subject to the court’s acceptance of the agreement.\n\nl94 See also USAM § 9-27.3oo (“Once the decision to prosecute has been made, the atorney for the government\nshould charge . . . the most serious offense that is consistent with the nature of the defendant’s conduct, and that is\nlikely to result in a sustainable conviction.”).\nl23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4447\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004449.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l52 of 349\ncooperation as part of a plea agreement, or compelling cooperation under a “use immunity” order.\nThe comment observes that these alternative means “are clearly preferable to permiting an\noffender to avoid any liability for his/her conduct” and “should be given serious consideration in\nthe first instance.” USAM 8§ 9-27.62o and 9-27.63o set forth considerations a prosecutor should\ntake into account when entering into a non-prosecution agreement. Generally, the U.S. Atorney\nhas authority to approve a non-prosecution agreement. USAM § 9-27.6oo comment. Houever,\nUSAM § 9-27.64o directs that a government atorney should not enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation without first obtaining the approval of the\nappropriate <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General, or his or her designee, when the person is someone who\n“is likely to become of major public interest.”\n\nThese USAM provisions do not address the uses of non-prosecution agreements in\ncircumstances other than when needed to obtain cooperation.\n5. USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity\nNothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure\nof third parties in negotiating with a criminal defendant. Instead, the provision that addresses\nimmunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has\nasserted a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. See USAM §§ 9-23.loo et seq.\n6. USAM/C.F.R. Provisions Relating to Financial Conflicts of Interest\nDepartment employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related\nlaws, rules, regulations, and policies. See, generally, USAM § l-4.ooo et seg. Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a financial interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the\nintegrity of the Department’s programs and operations. The determination must be made in\nwriting. See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.5ol-5o2.\nB. Other Department Policies\nl. Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the responsibility for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As applicable here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo).

The Ashcroft Memo cautioned\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“particularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy. In\naddition, the policy applies to “readily provable” charges, thus inherently allouing a prosecutor\nl95 The Ashcroft Memo was issued before the Supreme Court decided United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 22o\n(2oo5), which struck doun the provision of the federal sentencing statute that required federal district judges to impose\na sentence within the applicable Federal Sentencing Guidelines range. Those Guidelines were the product of\nthe United States Sentencing Commission, which was created by the Sentencing Reform Act of l984. The\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2oo3, Pub.\nL. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, was directed at preventing child abuse. It included a variety of provisions designed to\nimprove the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against children. Among other things, the PROTECT Act\nprovided for specific sentencing considerations for certain sex-related offenses, such as those involving multiple\noccasions of prohibited sexual conduct or those involving material with depictions of violence or with specified\nnumbers of images.\n\nl26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo445o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004460.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l63 of 349\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was\nmotivated by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the\nUSAM to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate. As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” /d. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment). The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo446o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004461.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l64 of 349\nagreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\n\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\n\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.”\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §8§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o6 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo446l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004462.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l65 of 349\nLongstanding Department policy directs prosecutors to require the defendant to plead to the most\nserious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the defendant’s criminal\nconduct, that has an adequate factual basis, is likely to result in a sustainable conviction, makes\nlikely the imposition of an appropriate sentence and restitution order, and does not adversely affect\nthe investigation or prosecution of others. See USAM §§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.7°? Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o8 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\nCircumstances,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional circumstances with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General, United States Atorney, or designated\n\nsupervisory atorney. This exception recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system. For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office. Houever, such case-by-case\n\nexceptions should be rare; otherwise the goals of fairness and equity will be\n\njeopardized.\nAshcroft Memo at § I.B.6.

The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafafia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4464\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004471.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l74 of 349\nd[id]n’t want to have to relive what happened to them.””!’ The co-case agent told OPR that one\nof the “strategies” for dealing with the victims’ fear was “to keep them off the stand,” and he\ngenerally remembered discussions about resolving the Epstein case in a way that protected the\nvictims’ identities. In addition, the CEOS Trial Atorney who briefly worked with Villafafia on\nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she\nformed the impression that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS\nTrial Atorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,’ but would have required an\nextensive amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about\npotentially being labeled as prostitutes. The CEOS Trial Atorney also told OPR that “there were\nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.7!®\n\nThe contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal\nand factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,\nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafafia’s proposed charges were whether the USAO\ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some\nminor victims had told Epstein they were l8. He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there\nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is\nuncharted territory to some degree.” In his July 5, 2oo7 email to Villafafia, Menchel cited Acosta’s\nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal\nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe Childhood.” Defense counsel raised\nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous leters to the USAO. Defense submissions\natacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have\nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of\nvictim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and\npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages.\n\nAcosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial\nissues,” his oun focus had been on “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure as\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had\nbeen involved in efforts to address sex trafficking. He told OPR that one of the “background\nissues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his leadership, and which influenced his\nview of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of\nprostitution. Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable\nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a mater\nof state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in\n2oo7.7\noh In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2oo7, when he located a\nvictim living outside of the United States, she claimed only to “knou Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved\naway to distance herself from this situation,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”\n\n2l8 In April 2oo7, a victim who was represented by an atorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded\ninterview with the FBI, with her atorney and his investigator present. This victim denied being involved in, or being\na victim of, criminal activity. Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”\n2l9 In his March 2o, 2oll leter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast,\nAcosta described “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.” Most\nof the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved\nl47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo447l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004477.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l8o of 349\n\nIn its review of the documentary record, OPR examined an email writen by Villafafia in\n2ol8, more than a decade after the NPA was negotiated, in which she suggested that the two-year\nsentence requirement in the initial “term sheet” provided to the defense was developed by Menchel\nas a favor to defense atorney Sanchez. OPR examined the facts surrounding this allegation and\ndetermined that there was no merit to it. Specifically, in December 2ol8, after the Miami Herald\ninvestigative report renewed public atention to the case, Villafafia recounted in an email to a\nsupervisory AUSA, a conversation she recalled having had with Sloman about the case.””° In the\nemail, Villafafia stated that she had not been a participant in discussions that led to Acosta’s\ndecision to offer a two-year plea deal, but she added the follouing: “Months (or possibly years)\nlater, I asked former First <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Jeff Sloman where the two-year figure came from. He said\nthat Lily [sic] Ann Sanchez (atorney for Epstein) asked Mr. Menchel to ‘do her a solid’ and\nconvince Mr. Acosta to offer two years.”\n\nOPR questioned both Villafafia and Sloman about the purported “do her a solid” remark.\nVillafafia told OPR that she had been aware that Menchel and Sanchez were friends. During her\nOPR interview, Villafafia explained:\n\n[A] lot later, I asked Jeff. I said, you knou, “Jeff, where did this two\nyears come from?” And he said, “Well, I always figured that. . .\nLilly asked Mat to do her a solid,” which I thought was such a\nstrange term, .. . “and to get her a good deal so that she would be in\nEpstein’s good graces” and that that’s where the two years came\nfrom. Although strangely enough, then several years after that, Jeff\nSloman asked me where the two years came from, and I had to\nremind him of that conversation. So Jeff doesn’t knou where the\ntwo years came from.\n\nBecause the email had been expressed in more definitive terms, OPR asked Villafafia\nwhether Sloman had affirmatively asserted that the two-year deal was a favor from Menchel to\ndefense counsel, or whether he had stated that he merely “figured” that was the case, but Villafafia\ncould not recall precisely what Sloman had said. At a follou-up interview, Villafafia again said\nthat she was unable to recall whether Sloman’s specific statement was “Lilly asked Mat to do her\na solid, and he did it,” or “I always figured Mat just wanted ... to do hera solid.” Villafafia stated\nthat she was unaware of any information that “expressly [indicated] that there was any sort of\nexchange of. . . a favor in either direction.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall making such a remark, although he could\nnot rule out the possibility that Villafafia, for whom he repeatedly expressed great respect, “heard\nthat in some fashion.” He told OPR that ifhe did say something to Villafafia about Menchel having\ndone “a solid” for Epstein’s counsel, he could not have meant it seriously, and he explained, “[I]t’s\nnot something that I would have believed. Him doing her a solid. I mean that’s the furthest thing\nfrom my recollection or impression even after years later.”\n\n225 Villafafia’s email stemmed from a congressional inquiry received by the Department concerning the Epstein\ninvestigation and the NPA, to which the USAO had been asked to assist in responding. In her email, Villafafa\naddressed several issues that she perceived to be the “three main questions” raised by the press coverage.\nl53\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4477\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004483.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l86 of 349\n\nThe meeting of USAO representatives and Epstein’s defense atorneys, together with the\nState Atorney and the lead state prosecutor on September l2, 2oo7, was a necessary part of the\nNPA negotiation process.\n\nEven after the NPA was signed, the defense continued to request meetings and reviews of\nthe case, both within the USAO and by the Department’s Criminal Division and the Deputy\nAtorney General. Although limited reviews were granted, during this period there was only one\nsubstantive meeting with Acosta, on December l4, 2oo7.7*? This meeting occurred in lieu of the\nmeeting Starr had requested of <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General Fisher, most likely because the defense\nsubmissions to the Department’s Criminal Division had raised issues not previously raised with\nthe USAO and the Department determined that Acosta should address those in the first instance.”**\nAcosta told OPR that he did not ask for the Department review, but he also did not want to appear\nas if he “fear[ed]” that review. Acosta’s nuanced position, houever, was not clear to the\nDepartment atorneys who responded to Epstein’s appeals and who perceived Acosta to be in favor\nof a Department review, rather than merely tolerant of it. Notably, though, none of those meetings\nor reviews resulted in the USAO abandoning the NPA, and Epstein gained no substantial\nadvantage from his continued entreaties.\n\nIn sum, in evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered the number of meetings, their\npurpose, the content of the discussions, and decisions made afterwards. OPR cannot say that the\nnumber of meetings, particularly those occurring before the NPA was signed, was so far outside\nthe norm—for a high profile case with skilled defense atorneys—that the quantity of meetings\nalone shous that the subjects were motivated by improper favoritism. In evaluating the subjects’\nconduct, OPR considered that the meetings were held with different levels of USAO managers and\nthat the explanations for the decisions to participate in the meetings reflected reasonable strategic\ngoals. Although OPR cannot rule out the possibility that because Acosta, Menchel, Lourie, or\nSloman knew or knew of the defense atorneys, they may have been willing to meet with them, it\nis also true that prosecutors routinely meet with defense atorneys, including those who are knoun\nto them and those who are not. Furthermore, meetings are more likely to occur in high profile\ncases involving defendants with the financial resources to hire skilled defense counsel who request\nmeetings at the highest levels of the USAO and the Department. Most significantly, OPR did not\nfind evidence supporting a conclusion that the meetings themselves resulted in any substantial\nbenefit to the defense. At each meeting, defense counsel strongly pressed the USAO—on factual,\nlegal, and policy grounds—to forgo its federal investigation and to return the mater to the state to\nproceed as it saw fit. The USAO never yielded on that point. Accordingly, OPR did not find\nevidence supporting a conclusion that Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia met with\ndefense counsel for the purpose of benefiting Epstein or that the meetings themselves caused\nAcosta or the other subjects to provide improper benefits to Epstein.\n\n282, Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz is discussed separately in the follouing section.\n233 Starr and other defense atorneys only obtained one meeting at the Department level, with Deputy <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span>\nAtorney General Mandelker and CEOS Chief Oosterban in March 2oo8.

Villafafia\nacknouledged that their tone was collegial and collaborative, and explained that generally, the\ntone of these emails reflected her personality and her commitment to complete the task her\nsupervisors had assigned to her:\n\n[I|f you were to pull all my e-mails on every case, you would find\nthat that is hou I communicate with people.

So I felt that\ngiven that task, the best way to complete them was to reach the\nagreement and, keeping in mind the terms that . . . our office had\nagreed to, and do that in a way that is civil. So... although my\nlanguage in the kind of introductory or prefatory communications\nwith Mr. Lefkouitz was casual and was friendly, when you look at\nthe terms and when he would come back to me asking for changes,\nmy response was always, “No, I will not make that change.”\n\nVillafafia denied any intention to keep the victims uninformed about the NPA or to provide\nan improper benefit for Epstein, and she explained the context of the emails in question. The email\nin which Villafafia expressed reluctance to “highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and all\nof the other persons that we could charge” was writen in response to a defense proposal to include\nin the federal plea agreement the parties were then considering a promise by the government not\nto prosecute Epstein’s assistants and other employees. Lefkouitz had proposed that the plea\nagreement state, “Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also precludes the\ninitiation of any and all criminal charges which might otherwise in the future be brought against\n[four named female assistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity] for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” Villafafia told OPR that\nthe USAO was not intending to charge Epstein’s assistants and was not aware of anyone else who\ncould be charged, and thus did not oppose the request not to prosecute third parties. Houever,\nVillafafia was concerned that an overly detailed federal plea agreement would prompt the court to\nrequire the government to provide further information about the uncharged conduct, which might\nlead Epstein to claim the government breached the agreement by providing information to the\ncourt not directly connected to the charges to which he was pleading guilty. Villafafia was not the\nonly one to express concern about hou deeply a federal court might probe the facts, and whether\nsuch probing would interfere with the viability of a plea agreement. In an earlier email, Lourie\nhad suggested charging Epstein by complaint to allou the USAO more flexibility in plea\nnegotiations and avoid the problem that a court might not accept a plea to a conspiracy charge that\nrequired dismissal of numerous substantive counts.\n\nAs to Villafafia’s offer to meet with Lefkouitz “off campus” to resolve outstanding issues\nin the NPA negotiation, she explained to OPR that she believed a face-to-face meeting at a\n“neutral” location—with “all the necessary decision makers present or ‘on call’”— might facilitate\ncompletion of the negotiations, which had dragged on for some time.\n\nl64\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4488\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004490.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l93 of 349\nentitled to significant weight, and OPR credits them. OPR finds, therefore, that the emails in\nquestion do not themselves establish that Villafafia (or any other subject) acted to improperly\nbenefit Epstein, was motivated by favoritism or other improper influences, or sought to silence\nvictims.\n\nG. The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta, Lourie, or Villafaia Agreed to\nthe NPA’s Provision Promising Not to Prosecute “Potential Co-conspirators”\nin Order to Protect Any of Epstein’s Political, Celebrity, or Other Influential\nAssociates\n\nOPR examined the decision by the subjects who negotiated the NPA—Villafafia, Lourie,\nand Acosta—to include in the agreement a provision in which the USAO agreed not to prosecute\n“any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” in addition to four named individuals, to determine\nwhether that provision resulted from the subjects’ improper favoritism touards Epstein or an\nimproper effort to shield from prosecution any of Epstein’s knoun associates. Other than various\ndrafts of the NPA and of a federal plea agreement, OPR found litle in the contemporaneous\nrecords mentioning the provision and nothing indicating that the subjects discussed or debated it—\nor even gave it much consideration. Drafts of the NPA and of the federal plea agreement shou\nthat the final broad language promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”\nevolved from a more narrou provision sought by the defense. The provision expanded as Villafafia\nand defense counsel exchanged drafts of, first, a proposed federal plea agreement and, then, of the\nNPA, with apparently litle analysis and no substantive discussion within the USAO about the\nprovision.”°”\n\nAs the NPA drafting process concluded, Villafafia circulated to Lourie and another\nsupervisor a draft that contained the non-prosecution provision, telling Lourie it was “some of\n[defense counsel’s] requested language regarding promises not to prosecute other people,” and\ncommenting only, “I don’t think it hurts us.” In a reply email, Lourie responded to another issue\n237 As set forth in OPR’s factual discussion, early in the negotiations over a federal plea agreement, the defense\nsought a non-prosecution provision applicable to only four female named assistants of Epstein and to unnamed\nemployees of one of his companies. Villafafia initially countered with “standard language” referring to unnamed\n“co-conspirators” so as to avoid “highlight[ing] for the judge all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that\nwe could charge.” Nonetheless, drafts of the NPA sent by Lefkouitz after Villafafia’s email continued to include\nlanguage referring to the four named assistants and unnamed employees. Villafafia, houever, internally circulated\ndrafts of a federal plea agreement that included language stating, “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability\nof the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal conduct by\nthose persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement.” The federal plea agreement draft revised\nby Lourie and Acosta on September 2o, 2oo7, included that language. When the defense team reverted to negotiation\nof state charges, Villafafia advised them, “In the context of a non-prosecution agreement, the [USAO] may be more\nwilling to be specific about not pursuing charges against others.” The next day, Lefkouitz sent a revised draft NPA\nreferring to the four named assistants, “any employee” of the named company, and “any unnamed co-conspirators for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” The language was finally revised by Villafafia\nto prohibit prosecution of “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to [the four named\nassistants].”\n\nIn commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel and Lourie both noted that the non-prosecution\nprovision could bind only the USAO, and Lourie further opined that it was limited to certain specified federal charges\nand a time-limited scope of conduct. Although the non-prosecution provision in the NPA did not explicitly contain\nsuch limitations, those limitations were included in other parts of the agreement.\n\nl66\nDOJ-OGR-oooo449o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004491.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l94 of 349\nVillafafia had raised (defense counsel’s atempt to insert an immigration waiver into the\nagreement), but Lourie did not comment on the provision promising not to prosecute co-\nconspirators or ask Villafafia to explain why she believed the provision did not harm the\ngovernment’s interests. In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“TaJny other thoughts,” but there is no indication that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.”** Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.”*°? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.”4! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of . . . the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n29 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\nAAO The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstein’s presence; this <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span> was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\n24l Villafafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo449l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004492.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l95 of 349\nLourie described the promise not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators” as “unusual,” and told\nOPR that he did not knou why it was included in the agreement, but added that it would be “unlike\nme if I read that language to just leave it in there unless I thought it was somehou helpful.” Lourie\nposited that victims who recruited other underage girls to provide massages for Epstein\n“theoretically” could have been charged as co-conspirators. He told OPR that when he saw the\nprovision, he may have understood the reference to unnamed “co-conspirators” as “a message to\nany victims that had recruited other victims that there was no intent to charge them.”\n\nAcosta did not recall any discussions about the non-prosecution provision. But he told\nOPR that Epstein was always “the focus” of the federal investigation, and he would have viewed\nthe federal interests as vindicated as long as Epstein was required to face “meaningful\nconsequences” for his actions. Acosta told OPR that when he reviewed the draft NPA, “[t]o the\nextent I reviewed this co-conspirator provision, I can speculate that my thinking would have been\nthe focus is on Epstein[ ].. . going to jail. Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other,\nlesser involved [individuals], is not the focus of this.” Acosta also told OPR that he assumed\nVillafafia and Lourie had considered the provision and decided that it was appropriate. Finally,\nSloman, who was not involved in negotiating the NPA, told OPR that in retrospect, he understood\nthe non-prosecution provision was designed to protect Epstein’s four assistants, and it “never\ndawned” on him that it was intended to shield anyone else.\n\nThis broad provision promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is\ntroubling and, as discussed more fully later in this Report, OPR did not find evidence shouing that\nthe subjects gave careful consideration to the potential scope of the provision or whether it was\nwarranted given that the investigation had been curtailed and the USAO lacked complete\ninformation regarding possible co-conspirators. Villafafia precipitously revised a more narrou\nprovision sought by the defense. Given its evolution from a provision sought by the defense, it\nappears unlikely to have been designed to protect the victims, and there is no indication that at the\ntime, the subjects believed that was the purpose. Houever, the USAO had not indicated interest\nin prosecuting anyone other than the four named female assistants, and OPR found no record\nindicating that Epstein had expressed concern about the prosecutive fate of anyone other than the\nfour assistants and unnamed employees of a specific Epstein company. Accordingly, OPR\nconcludes that the evidence does not shou that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia agreed to the non-\nprosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential\nassociates. 74”\n\nH. OPR’s Investigation Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing That Epstein\n\nCooperated in Other Federal Investigations or Received Special Treatment on\nThat Basis\n\nOne final issue OPR explored stemmed from media reports suggesting that Epstein may\nhave received special treatment from the USAO in return for his cooperation in another federal\n242 As previously stated, Sloman was on vacation when Villafafia included the provision in draft plea agreements\nand did not monitor the case or comment on the various iterations of the NPA that were circulated during his absence.\nMenchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7, before the parties drafted the NPA.\n\nl68\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4492\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004499.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o2 of 349\nEpstein’s state guilty plea.~° As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”>*!\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerms about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.”°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2oo Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\na In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n252 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstein and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4499\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004500.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o3 of 349\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span> photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.**? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\nae l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who .. . induces . . . any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of interstate . . .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate ... commerce .. .

Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the... bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third\nad In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004510.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l3 of 349\nparties.7°* The rush to reach a resolution should not have led the USAO to agree to such a\nsignificant provision without a full consideration of the potential consequences and justification\nfor the provision. It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n2n8 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s\n\nunderstood that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you\n\nknou the husband’s willing to go and take the weight .... This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor.

THE DEPARTMENT’S INTERPRETATION OF THE CVRA’S DEFINITION OF\n\n“CRIME VICTIM” AT THE TIME OF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. April l, 2oo5 Office of Legal Counsel “Preliminary Review”\n\nIn 2oo5, Department management requested informal guidance from the Department’s\nOffice of Legal Counsel (OLC) regarding interpretation of the CVRA’s definition of “crime\nvictim.””°? On April l, 2oo5, OLC provided “preliminary and informal” guidance by email,\nconcluding that “the status of a ‘crime victim’ may be reasonably understood to commence upon\nthe filing of a complaint, and that the status ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or\nprosecute the Federal offense that directly caused the victim’s harm.”*®\n266 H.

Villafafia acknouledged\nthat she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the\nagreement because “at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and\nthat we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”\n\nOn October l2, 2oo7, the FBI Victim Specialist sent a VNS form notice leter to a victim\nthe case agents had interviewed two days earlier. This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim Specialist sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\nidentified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD. The USAO Informs the Defense That It Intends to Notify Victims by Leter\nabout Epstein’s State Plea Hearing and the Resolution of the Federal\nInvestigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the Notification Plan\n\nIn anticipation of Epstein’s state court plea, Villafafia reported on November l6, 2oo7, to\nAcosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that she had learned, from FBI agents who met with\n<span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney Belohlavek, that the State Atorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify\nvictims of the state plea hearing.\n\n[Belohlavek] would still like us to do the victim notifications.

For example, one would not\ncooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third\nclaimed she had no contact with Epstein.\n\n3ll Villafafia told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or\ntwo victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”\n2l2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4536\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004537.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 24o of 349\nshe would inform victims of the terms of the resolution of the federal case, including Epstein’s\nagreement to plead guilty to state charges and serve l8 months in county jail, and the victims’\nability to seek monetary damages against Epstein. The leter also would invite victims to appear\nat the state court hearing and make a statement under oath or provide a writen statement to be\nfiled by the State Atorney’s Office. Sloman and Villafafia exchanged edits on the draft victim\nnotification leter, and Villafafia also informed Sloman that “[t]here are a few girls who didn’t\nreceive the original leters, so I will need to modify the introductory portion of the leter for\nthose.”?””\n\nSloman informed Lefkouitz of the government’s need to meet its “statutory obligation\n(Justice for All Act of 2oo4) to notify the victims of the anticipated upcoming events and their\nrights associated with the agreement” and his intent to “notify the victims by leter after COB\nThursday, November 29.” Lefkouitz objected to the proposal to notify the victims, asserting that\nit was “incendiary and inappropriate” and not warranted under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4. He\nargued that the defense “should have a right to review and make objections to that submission\nprior to it being sent to any alleged victims.” He also insisted that if any notification leters were\nsent to “victims, who still have not been identified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein\nhas entered his plea” and that the leter should come from the atorney representative rather than\nthe government. On November 28, 2oo7, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia provided Lefkouitz\nwith the draft victim notification leter, which would advise victims that the state court plea was\nto occur on December l4, 2oo7.7\n\nIn a November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz strongly objected to the proposed draft\nnotification leter, arguing that the government was not obligated to send any leter to victims until\nafter Epstein’s plea and sentencing. Lefkouitz also contended that the victims had no right to\nappear at Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing or to provide a writen statement for such a\nproceeding. In a November 3o, 2oo7 reply leter to Lefkouitz, Acosta did not address the\nsubstance of Lefkouitz’s arguments, but accused the defense team of “in essence presenting\ncollateral challenges” delaying effectuation of the NPA, and asserted that if Epstein was\ndissatisfied with the NPA, “we stand ready to unwind the Agreement” and proceed to trial. Shortly\nthereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by leter that he had directed prosecutors “not to\nissue victim notification leters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time\nto review these options with your client.” In the leter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that\nVillafafia had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary\ndamages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during\nthe investigation phase of this mater.”\n\nOn December 5, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz sent a leter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman\nand <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with\n3l2 On November 28, 2oo7, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafafia that\nonly l5 of the then-knoun victims had received victim notification leters from either the FBI or the USAO. On\nDecember 6, 2oo7, the lead case agent reported to Villafafia that she was “still holding many of the original V/W\nleters addressed to victims from the USAO.”\n\nSis Villafafia understood the state prosecutors had set the December l4, 2oo7 date, and emailed them for\nconfirmation, stating, “[I]f the mater is set for the l4th, please let me knou so I can include that in my victim\nnotifications.”\n2l3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4537\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004538.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 24l of 349\nthe USAO’s interpretation of the agreement and “the use of Section 2255.” The Starr and\nLefkouitz leter asserted it was “wholly inappropriate” for the USAO to send the proposed victim\nnotification leter “under any circumstances,” and “strongly urg[ed]” Acosta to withhold the\nnotification leter until after the defense was able “to discuss this mater with <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney\nGeneral Fisher.”\n\nThe follouing day, Sloman sent a leter to Lefkouitz, with copies to Acosta and Villafafia,\nasserting that the VRRA obligated the government to notify victims of the l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nproceedings as “other relief” to which they were entitled. Sloman also stated that the VRRA\nobligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning restitution to which\nthey may be entitled and “the earliest possible’ notice of the status of the investigation, the filing\nof charges, and the acceptance of a plea.?'* (Emphasis in original). Sloman added:\n\nJust as in l8 U.S.C. § 377l [the CVRA], these sections are not\n\nlimited to proceedings in a federal district court. Our Non-\n\nProsecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by\n\nallouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense. The victims\n\nidentified through the federal investigation should be appropriately\n\ninformed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.*!°\nSloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafafia or the\nFBI case agent with questions or concerns: “Again, federal law requires that victims have the\n‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’” Sloman advised\nthe defense: “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed\nto Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation. Those questions are appropriately directed to\nlaw enforcement.”\n\nAlong with this leter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkouitz for comment a revised draft victim\nnotification leter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense. The\nleter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been completed,” Epstein would\nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of imprisonment at sentencing,\nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The\nleter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing:\n\nAs I mentioned above, as part of the resolution of the federal\n\ninvestigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.\n\nMr. Epstein’s change of plea and sentencing will occur on\n\nDecember l4, 2oo7, at ___—a.m., before Judge Sandra K. McSorley,\n3l4 See 42 U.S.C. § lo6o7(c)(l)(B) and (c)(3).\n3l5 Emphasis in original. Sloman also stated that the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is\nsimply informing the victims of their rights.” Villafafia informed OPR that Sloman approved and signed the leter,\nbut she was the primary author of the document. OPR notes that Villafafia was the principal author of most\ncorrespondence in the Epstein case, and that follouing the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the leter went\nout with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three atorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence\nbefore a final version was sent to the defense.\n\n2l4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4538\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004542.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 245 of 349\nreview the appropriateness of the potential federal charges and the government’s “unprecedentedly\nexpansive interpretation” of l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn a December l9, 2oo7 response to the defense team, Acosta offered to revise two\nparagraphs in the NPA to resolve “disagreements” with the defense and to clarify that the parties\nintended Epstein’s § 2255 liability to “place these identified victims in the same position as they\nwould have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.” Acosta also advised\nthat although the USAO intended to notify the victims of the resolution of the federal investigation,\nthe USAO would leave to the State Atorney the decision whether to notify victims about the state\nproceedings:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court sentencing\nhearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim notification leter and\nthe statute. I would note that the United States provided the draft\nleter to the defense as a courtesy.

I agree that [the\nCVRA] applies to notice of proceedings and results of investigations\nof federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We intend to provide\nvictims with notice of the federal resolution, as required by law. We\nwill defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding whether\nhe wishes to provide victims with notice of the state proceedings,\nalthough we will provide him with the information necessary to do\nso if he wishes.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this leter without running it by [Sloman], if\nnot other individuals in the office,” and records shou he sent a draft to Sloman and Villafafia.\nAcosta explained to OPR that he was not concerned about deferring to Krischer on the issue of\nwhether to notify the victims of the state proceedings because he did not view it as his role, or the\nrole of the USAO, “to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to the state\noutcome.”*” Acosta further explained to OPR that despite the USAO’s initial concerns about the\nState Atorney’s Office’s handling of the Epstein case, he did not believe it was appropriate to\nquestion that office’s ability to “fulfill whatever obligation they have,” and he added, “Let’s not\nassume .. . that the State Atorney’s Office is full of bad actors.” Acosta told OPR that it was his\nunderstanding “that the victims would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have\nan opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.” Acosta also told OPR that the state would\n322 Sloman’s handwriten notes from a December 2l, 2oo7 telephone conference indicate that Acosta asked the\ndefense, “Are there concerns re: 377l lang[uage],” to which Lefkouitz replied, “The state should have their oun\nmechanism.” At the time of the Epstein mater, under the Florida Constitution, upon request, victims were afforded\nthe “right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of, and to be present at” a defendant’s plea and sentencing.

Additionally, it was and remains our position\n\nthat any notification should be by mail and that all proactive efforts\n\nby the FBI to have communications with the witnesses after the\n\nexecution of the Agreement should finally come to an end.

Lefkouitz argued that CVRA notification was not appropriate because\nthe Atorney General Guidelines defined “crime victim” as a person harmed as a result of an\noffense charged in federal district court, and Epstein had not been charged in federal court.\nNevertheless, Lefkouitz added that, despite their objection to CVRA notification, “[W]e do not\nobject (as we made clear in our leter last week) that some form of notice be given to the alleged\nvictims.” Lefkouitz requested both that the defense be given an opportunity to review any notice\nsent by the USAO, and that “any and all notices with respect to the alleged victims of state offenses\nshould be sent by the State Atorney rather than [the USAO],” and he agreed that the USAO\n“should defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding all maters with regard to those\nvictims and the state proceedings.”\n\nMonths later, in April 2oo8, Epstein’s atorneys complained in a leter to Mandelker that\nSloman and Villafafia commited professional misconduct by threatening to send a “highly\nimproper and unusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” victims.\n\nF.

Ultimately, defense counsel’s advocacy resulted in the USAO’s\ndecision to have the federal case reviewed afresh. A review of the evidence was undertaken first\nby USAO Criminal Chief Robert Senior and then, briefly, by an experienced CEOS trial\natorney. A review of the case in light of the defense challenges was then conducted by CEOS\nChief Oosterban, in consultation with his staff and with Deputy <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General Sigal\nMandelker and <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General Alice Fisher, and then by the Office of the Deputy\nAtorney General.

[and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged, and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled “explaining that the case was under investigation,” that they “were preparing\nthe case [for charging] again,” and “expressing our hope that charges would be brought.” Villafafia\nrecalled one victim “making a comment about the amount of [imprisonment] time and why was it\nso lou” and Villafafia answered, “that was the agreement that the office had reached.”**?\n\nWith regard to the victims Villafafia interviewed who had not received an FBI notification\nin October 2oo7, Villafafia recalled discussing one victim’s safety concerns but not whether they\ndiscussed the agreement. She recalled telling another victim that “we thought we had reached an\nagreement with [Epstein] and then we didn’t,” but was “prety sure” that she did not mention the\nagreement during the interview of the third victim.

Acosta told OPR that he\nbelieved the state would notify the victims of the “all-encompassing plea” resolving the federal\ncase “and [the victims would] have an opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\nNevertheless, Acosta did not knou whether the state victims overlapped with the federal victims\nor whether the USAO “shared that list with them.” Villafafia told OPR that she and Acosta\n“understood that the state would notify the state victims” but that neither of them were aware “that\nthe state only believed they had one victim.”*°® Villafafia told OPR that there was “very litle”\ncommunication between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, and although she discussed a\nfactual proffer with the State Atorney’s Office and “the fact that . . . the federal investigation had\nidentified additional victims,” she did not recall discussing “who the specific people were that they\nconsidered victims in the state case.”*°?\n\nSloman told OPR that the “public perception . . . that we tried to hide the fact of the results\nof this resolution from the victims” was incorrect. He explained:\n\n[E]ven though we didn’t have a legal obligation, I felt that the\n\nvictims were going to be notified and the state was going . .. to\n\nfulfill that obligation, and even as another failsafe, [the victims]\n\nwould be notified of . . . the restitution mechanism that we had set\n\nup on their behalf.\nSloman acknouledged that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims,\n\nit was [of] concern that this was going to break doun and... . result\n\nin us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be\n\nwitnesses and if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey,\n\nyou’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s . . . going to be instant\n\nimpeachment for the defense.\nA57 <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney Belohlavek told OPR that federal victms who were not a party to the state case\nwould not have been able to stmply appear at the state plea hearing and participate in the proceedings. Rather, such a\npresentation would have required coordination between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office and additional\ninvestigation of the victims’ allegations and proposed statements by the State Atorney’s Office.\noe In an email a few months earlier, Villafafia noted, “The state indictment [for solicitation of adult prostitution]\nis related to two girls. One of those girls is included in the federal [charging document], the other is not.”\n359 As noted in Chapter Two, Villafafia had stopped communicating with the State Atorney’s Office regarding\nthe state case follouing Epstein’s defense team’s objections to those communications.\n\n233\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4557\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004558.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 26l of 349\nWhen asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing,\nSloman responded that he “was more focused on the restitution provisions. I didn’t get the sense\nthat the victims were overly interested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n\nAlso, in late June, Villafafia drafted a victim notification leter concerning the June 3o,\n2oo8 plea.*°° Villafafia told OPR that, because “Mr. Acosta had agreed in December 2oo7 that we\nwould not provide writen notice of the state change of plea, the writen victim notifications were\nprepared to be sent immediately follouing Epstein’s guilty plea.”**! As she did with prior draft\nvictim notification leters, Villafafia provided the draft to the defense for comments.*\n\nAlthough Epstein’s plea hearing was set for June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia took steps to facilitate\nthe filing of federal charges on July l, 2oo8, in the event he did not plead guilty in state court.\n\nOPR reviewed voluminous Epstein-related files that the State Atorney’s Office made\navailable online, but OPR was unable to locate any document establishing that before the hearing\ndate, the state informed victims of the June 3o, 2oo8 plea. On March l2, 2oo8, the State Atorney’s\nOffice issued trial subpoenas to three victims and one non-law enforcement witness commanding\nthe individuals to “remain on call” during the week of July 8, 2oo8. Houever, the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriff was unable to serve one of the victims in person because the victim was “away [at]\ncollege.”\nXI. JUNE 3o, 2oo8: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS GUILTY PLEAS IN A STATE COURT\n\nHEARING AT WHICH NO VICTIMS ARE PRESENT\n\nOn June 3o, 2oo8, Epstein appeared in state court in West Palm Beach, with his atorney\nJack Goldberger, and pled guilty to an information charging him with procuring a person under l8\nfor prostitution, as well as the indictment charging him with felony solicitation of prostitution. The\ninformation charged that between August l, 2oo4, and October 9, 2oo5, Epstein “did knouingly\nand unlawfully procure for prostitution, or caused to be prostituted, [REDACTED], a person under\nthe age of l8 years,” and referred to no other victims. The indictment did not identify any victims\nand alleged only that Epstein engaged in the charged conduct on three occasions between August\nl, 2oo4, and October 3l, 2oo5. Although the charges did not indicate whether they applied to\nmultiple victims, during the hearing, <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney Belohlavek informed the court that\n“Tt]here’s several” victims. When the court asked Belohlavek whether “the victims in both these\ncases [were] in agreement with the terms of this plea,” Belohlavek replied, “I have spoken to\nseveral myself and I have spoken to counsel, through counsel as to the other victim, and I believe,\n36o Sloman forwarded the draft victim notification leter to Acosta, who responded with his oun edited version\nstating, “What do you think?” Villafafa edited it further.\n36l The leter began with the statement, “On June 3o, 2oo8, Jeffrey Epstein . . . entered a plea of guilty.” A week\nafter Epstein’s state guilty plea, Villafafia notified Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that “[Epstein’s local\natorney] Jack Goldberger is back in toun today, so I am hoping that we will finalize the last piece of our agreement—\nthe victim list and Notification. If I face resistance on that front, I will let you knou.”\n362 According to Villafafia, either Acosta or Sloman made the decision to send the notifications follouing the\nstate plea and to share the draft notification leters with the defense.\n\n234\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4558\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004559.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 262 of 349\nyes.” The court also asked Belohlavek if the juvenile victim’s parents or guardian agreed with the\nplea, and Belohlavek stated that because the victim was no longer under age l8, Belohlavek spoke\nwith the victim’s counsel, who agreed with the plea agreement.*®\n\nBoth Villafafia and the FBI case agent were present in the courtroom gallery to observe the\nplea hearing. Later that day, Villafafia met with Goldberger and gave him the list of 3l individuals\nthe government was prepared to name as victims and to whom the § 2255 provision applied.\n\nIn her 2ol5 CVRA case declaration, Wild stated that, “I did not have any reason to atend\nthat hearing because no one had told me that this guilty plea was related to the FBI’s investigation\nof Epstein’s abuse of me.” She stated that she “would have atended and tried to object to the\njudge and prevent that plea from going forward,” had she knoun that the state plea “had some\nconnection to blocking the prosecution of my case.” Similarly, CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2\nstated that “no one notified me that [Epstein’s] plea had anything to do with my case against him.”\n\nAn atorney who represented several victims, including one whom the state had\nsubpoenaed for the potential July trial, told OPR that he was present in court on June 3o, 2oo8, in\norder to serve a complaint upon Epstein in connection with a civil lawsuit brought on behalf of\none of his clients. The USAO had not informed him about the plea hearing.**4 Moreover, the\natorney informed OPR that, although one of the victims he represented had been interviewed in\nthe PBPD’s investigation and had been deposed by Epstein’s atorneys in the state case (with the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney present), he did not recall receiving any notice of the June 3o, 2oo8 plea\nhearing from the State Atorney’s Office.*® Similarly, another of the victims the state had\nsubpoenaed for the July trial told OPR through her atorney that she received subpoenas from the\nState Atorney’s Office, but she was not invited to or aware of the state plea hearing. Belohlavek\ntold OPR that she did not recall whether she contacted any of the girls to appear at the hearing,\nand she noted that given the charge of solicitation of prostitution, they may not have “technically”\nbeen victims for purposes of notice under Florida law but, rather, witnesses. On July 24, 2oo8, the\nState Atorney’s Office sent leters to two victims stating that the case was closed on June 26, 2oo8\n(although the plea occurred on June 3o, 2oo8) and listed Epstein’s sentence. The leters did not\nmention the NPA or the federal investigation.\n\nXI. SIGNIFICANT POST-PLEA DEVELOPMENTS\nA. Immediately After Epstein’s State Guilty Pleas, Villafafia Notifies Some\nVictims’ Atorneys\n\nVillafafia’s contemporaneous notes shou that immediately after Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\nguilty pleas, she atempted to reach by telephone five atorneys representing various victims in\n368 Villafafia, who was present in court and heard Belohlavek’s representation, told OPR that she had no\ninformation as to whether or hou the state had notified the victims about the plea hearing.\ntbe Villafafia did contact this atorney’s law partner later that day.\n\n365 When interviewed by OPR in 2o2o, this same atorney indicated that he was surprised to learn that despite\nthe fact that his client was a minor at the time Epstein victimized her, she was not the minor victim that the state\nidentified in the information charging Epstein.\n235\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4559\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004591.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 294 of 349\n\nThereafter, in his December l9, 2oo7 leter to defense counsel mainly addressing other\nmaters, Acosta informed the defense that the USAO would defer to the State Atorney’s discretion\nthe responsibility for notifying victims about Epstein’s state plea hearing:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court [plea and]\nsentencing hearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim\nnotification leter and the statute. I would note that the United States\nprovided the draft leter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition,\nFirst <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> United States Atorney Sloman already incorporated\nin the leter several edits that had been requested by defense counsel.\nI agree that Section 377l applies to notice of proceedings and results\nof investigations of federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We\nintend to provide victims with notice of the federal resolution, as\nrequired by law. We will defer to the discretion of the State Atorney\nregarding whether he wishes to provide victims with notice of the\nstate proceedings, although we will provide him with the\ninformation necessary to do so if he wishes.\n(Emphasis added.)\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this [leter] without running it by [Sloman],\nif not other individuals in the office.” Acosta explained that it was “not for me to direct the State\nAtorney, or for our office to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to\nthe state outcome.” Acosta acknouledged that the USAO initially had concerns about the state’s\nhandling of the case, but he told OPR, “that doesn’t mean that they will not fulfill whatever\nobligation they have. Let’s not assume. . . that the State Atorney’s office is full of bad actors.”\nSloman initially believed that “the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially\nbecause they had restitution rights under [§] 2255”; but his expectations changed after “there was\nan agreement made that we were going to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to\ndecide hou the victims were going to be notified.”*!7 Sloman told OPR he had been “proceeding\nunder the belief that we were going to notify the victims,” even though “this was not a federal\ncase,” but once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO “had concerns that if\nwe g[a]ve them the victim notification leter .. . and the deal fell apart, then the victims would be\ninstantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary compensation.”\n\nOPR could not determine whether the State Atorney’s Office notified any victims in\nadvance of the June 3o, 2oo8 state plea hearing. Krischer told OPR that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad a robust and effective victim notification process and staff, but he was not aware of whether\nor hou it was used in the Epstein case. Belohlavek told OPR that she could not recall whether\nvictims were notified of the hearing nor whether the state law required notification for the\naly Sloman stated in his June 3, 2oo8 leter to Deputy Atorney General Filip that Acosta made the decision\ntogether with the Department’s Criminal Division Deputy <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General Mandelker. Acosta did consult\nwith Mandelker about the § 2255 civil damages recovery process, but neither Acosta nor Mandelker recalled\ndiscussing the issue of victim notification, and OPR found no other documentation indicating that Mandelker played\na role in the deferral decision.\n\n267\nDOJ-OGR-oooo459l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004602.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o5 of 349\npreviously noted, there is some contemporaneous evidence supporting her assertion. Villafafia’s\nmention of the agreement, even if not described in specific terms, would have been sufficient to\napprise those victims of the status of the federal investigation.\n\nNevertheless, Villafafia did not recall discussing the NPA specifically or in general terms\nwith other victims interviewed at that time, nor did she do so with Edwards or any other victim’s\natorney. OPR therefore considered whether the omission of information about the existence of\nthe NPA during these interactions rose to the level of professional misconduct in violation of FRPC\n4-4.l or 4-8.4.44!\n\nOPR evaluated Villafafia’s conduct in light of the comment to FRPC 4-4.l:\n\nA lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a\n\nclient’s behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an\n\nopposing party of relevant facts. A misrepresentation can occur if\n\nthe lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that\n\nthe lawyer knous is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by\n\npartially true but misleading statements or omissions that are the\n\nequivalent of affirmative false statements.\nThe victims and their atorneys were certainly not “opposing part[ies]” to the USAO, but the\ncomment indicates that the rule recognizes that omissions made during discussions with third\nparties, even of relevant facts, are not always treated as false statements.\n\nHere, the evidence does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made an affirmative false\nstatement to the victims or Edwards or that her omissions were “the equivalent of affirmative false\nstatements” about material facts. First, Villafafia told OPR that she believed the investigation was\nongoing and her statement to that effect truthful, and as discussed earlier in this Chapter, the\nevidence shous that Villafafia and the agents did continue to investigate the case until Epstein\nentered his guilty plea in state court in June 2oo8. Villafafia’s email correspondence with her\nsupervisors reflects her strong advocacy during that timeframe to declare Epstein in breach and to\ncharge him. The evidence similarly does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made any affirmative\nfalse statement to Edwards when she informed him of the state court plea, although she declined\nto provide additional information in response to his questions.*”\n\nSecond, in reaching its conclusion, OPR considered the full context in which Villafafia\ninteracted with the victims and Edwards. Prosecutors routinely make decisions about what\ninformation will be disclosed to witnesses, including victims, for a variety of strategic reasons. In\nmany cases, prosecutors must make difficult decisions about providing information to witnesses,\ni In Florida Bar v. Joy, the court affirmed a referee’s conclusion that Joy violated FRPCs 4-4.l(a) and 4-8.4(c)\n“for making false statements by omission of material facts in his representations [to counsel].” Florida Bar v. Joy,\n679 So. 2d ll65, ll66-68 (Fla. l996). See also Florida Bar re Webster, 647 So. 2d 8l6 (Fla. l994) (petition for\nremstatement denied due to “misrepresentation by omission’).\n\n2 In Feinberg, 76o So. 2d at 938, the court found that an <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney lacked candor and violated\nethics rules when, after meeting with a defendant outside his atorney’s presence, the prosecutor falsely stated to the\ndefense atorney that he (the prosecutor) had not met with the defendant.\n278\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004607.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3lo of 349\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation. OPR conducted extensive interviews of\nall five subjects. The subjects also submited comments on OPR’s draft report.\n\n283\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004612.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3l5 of 349\nAtorney’s Offices was migrated to EOUSA’s centralized system to be maintained. The USAO’s\ndata was migrated between March and June 2oo8.\n\nEOUSA and OPR separately confirmed with the USAO that it was unable to locate any\nadditional emails. OPR questioned Acosta, as well as numerous administrative staff, about the\nemail gap. Acosta and the witnesses denied having any knouledge of the problem, or that they or,\nto their knouledge, anyone else made any efforts to intentionally delete the emails. In addition, at\nOPR’s request, EOUSA conducted an analysis of records migrated from four other U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices and found that each office provided data that also contained significant gaps in their U.S.\nAtorney email records, although the time periods varied for each office. OPR found no evidence\nindicating that the gap in Acosta’s emails was caused by any intentional act or for the purpose of\nconcealing evidence relating to the Epstein investigation and concludes that it was most likely the\nresult of a technological error.\n\nAlthough a gap in Acosta’s email inbox from May 26, 2oo7, through April 2, 2oo8,\nremained, OPR was nonetheless able to examine a significant number of Acosta’s emails from this\ntime due to the extensive case files kept by the USAO; the availability of Acosta’s sent email,\nwhich did not contain a similar gap; and the availability of emails of other USAO subjects and\nwitnesses who were included on emails with Acosta.\n\n3. Federal Bureau of Investigation Records\n\nOPR worked with the FBI’s Palm Beach Office, including with two case agents and the\nVictim Witness Specialist who worked on the Epstein mater, to obtain relevant FBI documents.\nIn addition, the FBI searched its Automated Case Support system and also provided documentation\nconcerming its victim notification system.\n\n4. Criminal Division Records\n\nThe Office of the <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General for the Criminal Division provided OPR with\nOutlook data for the four individuals from that Office who examined issues connected to the\nUSAO’s Epstein investigation. The data included the individuals’ inbox, outbox, sent, deleted,\nand saved emails, and calendar entries.\n\nCEOS also provided OPR with Outlook data for the four individuals from that office who\nworked on, or examined issues connected to, the USAO’s Epstein investigation. The data included\nthe individuals’ inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and saved emails. CEOS also conducted a check of\nits shared hard drive and provided documents that were potentially relevant to OPR’s investigation.\n\n5. Office of the Deputy Atorney General Records\n\nOPR obtained Outlook data for the three individuals from the Office of the Deputy\nAtorney who examined issues connected to the USAO’s Epstein investigation, including the\nformer Deputy Atorney General.

Information from Subjects, Witnesses, and Victims\nl. Subjects\nOPR requested that all five subjects provide writen responses detailing their involvement\nin the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions\nrelating to victim notification and consultation. In addition, OPR conducted extensive interviews\nof each subject under oath and before a court reporter. Each subject was represented by counsel\nand had access to relevant contemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview. The\nsubjects reviewed and provided comments on their interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report.\n2. Witnesses\nOPR conducted more than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their\nsupervisors, and FBI administrative personnel. OPR interviewed current and former USAO staff\nand atorneys and current and former Department atorneys and senior managers, including former\nDeputy Atorney General Mark Filip and former <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General for the Criminal\nDivision Alice Fisher.

NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nMaxwell moves to suppress evidence obtained through a grand jury subpoena to a law\nfirm involved in earlier civil litigation against her. She contends that because the documents\nsought by the subpoena were previously subject to a protective order, the Government obtained\nthem in violation of her rights against compelled self-incrimination, against unreasonable\nsearches and seizures, and to due process of law. For the reasons that follou, the Court\nconcludes that the evidence should not be suppressed and that Maxwell is not entitled to an\nevidentiary hearing.\n\nI. Background\n\nIn late 2ol5, Virginia Giuffre sued Maxwell for defamation. See Giuffre v. Maxwell, No.\nl5-cv-7433 (S.D.N.Y.). Giuffre alleged that Maxwell defamed her by accusing her of lying\nabout Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein sexually abusing her. The law firm Boies Schiller Flexner\nLLP (BSF) represented Giuffre in the dispute. The parties litigated the case for about two years\nbefore signing a confidential setlement agreement.\n\nEarly in the civil litigation, one of the atorneys representing Giuffre approached an\n<span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> United States Atorney (AUSA) in the Southern District of New York and requested a\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4785\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004809.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3o9 _ Filed o7/ol/2l Page3of3\n\nHonorable Alison J.

What is more,\nthe Op-Ed falsely suggested to potential jurors that this prosecution is barred by a non-prosecution\nagreement—a legal contention this Court has considered and squarely rejected.\n\nThis Court has already entered an Order—at the request of the defendant—indicating the\nCourt’s expectation that “all involved parties will exercise great care to ensure compliance with\nthis Court’s local rules, including Local Criminal Rule 23.l.” (Dkt. No. 28). Mr. Markus’s\ncontinued comments are in violation of that Order, are inappropriate, and are likely to interfere\nwith the Court’s ability to conduct a fair trial with an impartial jury in this case.

During this conversation,\nCosby offered to continue assisting Constand if she still desired to work in sports\nbroadcasting. He also indicated that he would pay for Constand to continue her\neducation. Cosby asked Constand to meet him in person to discuss these maters further,\nand told her that he would have someone contact her to set up the meeting. As with the\nprevious call, Cosby again refused to identify the pills that he had provided to Constand\non the night of the alleged assault.\n\nWithin days of filing the police report, Constand received two telephone messages\nfrom people associated with Cosby. The first message was from one of Cosby’s\nassistants, calling on Cosby’s behalf to invite Constand and her mother to Cosby’s\nupcoming performance in Miami, Florida. Constand called the representative back and\nrecorded the call. The representative asked for certain details about Constand and her\nmother so that he could book flights and hotel rooms for them. Constand declined the\noffer and did not provide the requested information. Constand then received a message\nfrom one of Cosby’s atorneys, who stated that he was calling to discuss the creation of\na trust that Cosby wanted to set up in order to provide financial assistance for Constand’s\neducation. Constand never returned the atorney’s call.\n\nIn the meantime, the Durham Regional Police Department referred Constand’s\npolice report to the Philadelphia Police Department, which, in turn, referred it to the\nCheltenham Police Department in Montgomery County, where Cosby’s residence was\nlocated. The case was assigned to Sergeant Richard Schaeffer, who worked in tandem\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo482o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004828.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page l6 of 8o\nphone calls were being recorded. Although he did not believe that Constand was making\nthese allegations in an atempt to get money from him, Cosby explained that, after\nConstand and her mother confronted him, he offered to pay for her education and asked\nhis atorney to commence discussions regarding seting up a trust for that purpose.\nCosby admited that it would be in his best interests if the public believed that Constand\nhad consented to the encounter, and that he believed he would suffer financial\nconsequences if the public believed that he had drugged and assaulted her.\n\nNotably, during his depositions, Cosby confessed that, in the past, he had provided\nQualudes®*—not Benadrylto other women with whom he wanted to have sexual\nintercourse.\n\nEventually, Constand setled her civil suit with Cosby for $3.38 million.’ Initially,\nthe terms of the setlement and the records of the case, including Cosby’s depositions,\nwere sealed.

So you almost certainly knou\n\nthis already. |’m writing to you just in case you might have forgoten what\n\nwe did with Cosby back in 2oo5. Atached is my opinion from then.\n\nOnce we decided that the chances of prevailing in a criminal case were too\n\nremote to make an arrest, | concluded that the best way to achieve justice\n\nwas to create an atmosphere where [Constand] would have the best chance\n\nof prevailing in a civil suit against Cosby. With the agreement of [Atorney]\n\nPhillips and [Constand’s] lawyers, | wrote the atached as the ONLY\n\ncomment | would make while the civil case was pending. Again, with the\n\nagreement of the defense lawyer and [Constand’s] lawyers, | intentionally\n\nand specifically bound the Commonwealth that there would be no state\n\nprosecution of Cosby in order to remove from him the ability to claim his\n\nFifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination, thus forcing him to\n\nsit for a deposition under oath. [Atorney Phillips] was speaking for Cosby’s\n\nside at the time, but he was in contact with Cosby’s civil lawyers who did\n\nnot deal with me directly that | recall. | only discovered today that [Atorney\n\nPhillips] had died. But those lawyers representing [Constand] civilly, whose\n\nnames | did not remember until | saw them in recent media accounts, were\n\npart of this agreement because they wanted to make Cosby testify. |\n\nbelieved at the time that they thought making him testify would solidify their\n\ncivil case, but the only way to do that was for us (the Commonwealth) to\n\npromise not to prosecute him.

The Commonwealth, defense and civil\n\nplaintiff's lawyers were all in agreement that the atached\n\ndecision from me stripped Cosby of his Fifth Amendment\n\nprivilege against self-incrimination forcing him to be deposed.\nHe indicated in his email that he learned Mr. Phillips had died on the date\nof his email. The email also suggested that the deposition might be subject\nto suppression.\nMs. Ferman responded to Mr. Castor’s email by leter of September 25,\n2ol5, requesting a copy of the “writen declaration” indicating that [Cosby]\nwould not be prosecuted. In her leter, Ms. Ferman indicated that “[t]he first\n| heard of such a binding agreement was your email sent this past\nWednesday. The first | heard of a writen declaration documenting the\nagreement not to prosecute was authored on 9/24/l5 and published today\nby Margaret Gibbons of the Intelligencer. ... We have been in contact with\ncounsel for both Mr. Cosby and Ms. Constand and neither has provided us\nwith any information about such an agreement.”\nMr. Castor responded by email. His email indicated,\n\nThe atached Press Release is the writen determination that\n\nwe would not prosecute Cosby. That was what the lawyers\n\nfor the plaintiffs wanted and | agreed. The reason | agreed\n\nand the plaintiff's wanted it in writing was so Cosby could not\n\ntake the 5\" Amendment to avoid being deposed or\n\ntestifying. ... That meant to all involved, including Cosby’s\n\nlawyer at the time, Mr. Phillips, that what Cosby said in the\n\ncivil litigation could not be used against him in a criminal\n\nprosecution for the event we had him under investigation for\n\nin early 2oo5. | signed the press release for precisely this\n\nreason, at the request of Plaintiff's counsel, and with the\n\nacquiescence of Cosby’s counsel, with full and complete\n\nintent to bind the Commonwealth that anything Cosby said in\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4836\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004837.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 25 of 8o\n\nthe civil case could not be used against him, thereby forcing\n\nhim to be deposed and perhaps testify in a civil trial without\n\nthe ability to “take the 5.” | decided to create the best\n\npossible environment for the Plaintiff to prevail and be\n\ncompensated. By signing my name as District Atorney and\n\nissuing the atached, | was “signing off” on the Commonwealth\n\nnot being able to use anything Cosby said in the civil case\n\nagainst him in a criminal prosecution, because | was stating\n\nthe Commonwealth will not bring a case against Cosby for the\n\nincident based on the then-available evidence in order to help\n\nthe Plaintiff prevail in her civil action . . . [nJaturally, if a\n\nprosecution could be made out without using what Cosby\n\nsaid, or anything derived from what Cosby said, | believed\n\nthen and continue to believe that a prosecution is not\n\nprecluded.\nMr. Castor testified that he intended to confer transactional immunity upon\n[Cosby] and that his pouer to do so as the sovereign was derived from\ncommon law not from the statutes of Pennsylvania. In his final email to Ms.\nFerman, Mr. Castor stated, “Il never agreed we would not prosecute Cosby.”\nAs noted, Ms. Constand’s civil atorneys also testified at the hearing.\nDolores Troiani, Esq. testified that during the 2oo5 investigation, she had\nno contact with the District Atorney’s office and limited contact with the\nCheltenham Police Department. Bebe Kivitz, Esq. testified that during the\n2oo5 investigation she had limited contact with then-First <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> District\nAtorney Ferman. The possibility of a civil suit was never discussed with\nanyone from the Commonwealth or anyone representing [Cosby] during the\ncriminal investigation. At no time did anyone from Cheltenham Police, or\nthe District Atorney's Office, convey to Ms. Troiani, or Ms. Kivitz, that\n[Cosby] would never be prosecuted. They learned that the criminal case\nwas declined from a reporter who came to Ms. Troiani’s office in the evening\nof February l7, 2oo5 seeking comment about what Bruce Castor had done.\nThe reporter informed her that Mr. Castor had issued a press release in\nwhich he declined prosecution. Ms. Troiani had not receive any prior\nnotification of the decision not to prosecute.\nMs. Constand and her atorneys did not request a declaration from Mr.\nCastor that [Cosby] would not be prosecuted. Ms. Troiani testified that if\n[Cosby] atempted to invoke the Fifth Amendment during his civil\ndepositions they would have filed a motion and he would have likely been\nprecluded since he had given a statement to police. If he was permited to\nassert a Fifth Amendment privilege, they would have been entitled to an\nadverse inference jury instruction. Additionally, if [Cosby] asserted the Fifth\nAmendment, Ms. Constand’s version of the story would have been the only\nversion for the jury to consider. Ms. Constand and her counsel had no\nreason to request immunity.

Houever, because the law requires that “back time”\nsentences and new sentences be served consecutively, Zuber was legally obligated to\nbegin serving his sentences one after the other, instead of simultaneously. /d.\n\nZuber sought post-conviction relief, arguing that the plea as stated in open court\nhad to be enforced, statutory law notwithstanding. On appeal to this Court, Zuber argued\nthat he was “induced by the specific promise made by the Commonwealth,” which\nultimately turned out to be a “false and empty one.” /d. We noted that plea bargaining is\nlooked upon favorably and that “the integrity of our judicial process demands that certain\nsafeguards be stringently adhered to so that the resultant plea as entered by a defendant\nand accepted by the trial court will always be one made voluntarily and knouingly, with a\nfull understanding of the consequences to follou.” /d.\n\n[T]here is an affirmative duty on the part of the prosecutor to honor any and\n\nall promises made in exchange for a defendant’s plea.

Nonetheless, because, inter alia, Zuber had “reasonably relied\nupon the advice of his counsel and the expression of that specific promise stated in open\ncourt by the <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span> district atorney,” id. at 445, he was entitled to the benefit of the\nbargain.

Moreover, I will instruct\n2l jurors, as is standard, to the effect that the government is\n22 not on trial. And that standard charge can be found in many\n23 cases.

Flight Records — Passenger Manifests and Shoppers Travel Records\n\nExactly when the accusers traveled across state lines and when the instances of illegal\nsexual activity took place were critical issues at trial. Not only were these dates relevant for the\njury to assess the accuracy of the witness’ recollections of events that had occurred over 2o years\nago, but they were also important because the accusers needed to be younger than l7 years old\nfor the sexual activity to be illegal under New York law. Contemporaneous flight records would\nhave offered the best possible evidence to shou exactly when accusers traveled. The only such\nrecords admited at trial were the flight logs kept by David Rodgers, which were incomplete and\noften identified passengers simply by their first names or generic identifiers like “l female” or “l\nmale.” Rodgers and Larry Visoski testified that the passenger manifests also contained\ninformation about the names of the passengers on the flights. Tr. l8l9; l7l-73. Because of the\npassage of time, houever, the flight manifests did not go back to the time period charged in the\nIndictment.\n\nOf particular interest were entries in Rodgers’ flight logs which shoued that someone\nwith Jane’s true first name was a passenger on two flights when Jane was l6 years old — one to\nNew York on November ll, l996, and another to Santa Fe, New Mexico on May 9, l997.\nHouever, because only the first name was listed, the flight logs did not conclusively establish\nthat it was Jane on those flights. Had the passenger manifests been available, the defense could\nhave used them to challenge whether Jane was on those flights as well as the accuracy of Jane’s\nrecollection of events.\n\nSimilarly, Cimberly Espinosa testified that Epstein often had his assistants buy\ncommercial plane tickets for people and that they used a travel service called Shoppers Travel to\nbook them. Tr. 2349. Annie Farmer testified that Epstein bought her a commercial ticket to fly\nto New Mexico in the spring of l996, which was the trip where she claimed she was given a\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8955\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008965.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6o3 Filed o2/l6/22 Page3of3\nPage 3\nof the briefing that quote publicly available court transcripts and news articles.

If there is one example of the\n\ndepth of David’s commitment to coaching, it is the basketball\n\ntraining sessions he designed and managed for students outside of\n\nthe organized teams he coached. On his oun initiative, David\n\narranged for a gym to be available during the week for all children,\n\neven those who didn’t make a team.... There are not many of us\n\n_.

Of course, we believe that even that calculation produces a\nrange that is still far too harsh. See, e.g., Smirlock v. United States, 2oo5 U.S. Dist.

Conclusion\n\nIn her sentencing submission, Donna Guerin catalogued the sentences that have\nbeen imposed on those who designed and marketed illegal tax shelters. See Guerin’s Am.\nSentencing Mem. l3-l6, ECF No. 592. They have varied greatly in length. What makes this\ncase different is that David Parse did not design or market tax shelters; he was a broker executing\ntrades. Indeed, to our knouledge, of all of the brokers who performed that function for Jenkins\nand other law firms, he and Craig Brubaker were the only two people who were prosecuted, and\nhe is the only one who stands convicted.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo95l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009525.jpg": "Case l€2oser4oo33o& ABcurDoecupreAt 6lo8/2o Filed Gea Pagrageiee of ll7\nA-6o74\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o5 _ Filed o3/l8/l3 Page l of 4l\n\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\n\nee |\n\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, :\n\n-v.- : S3 o9 Cr. 58l (WHP)\n\nPAUL DAUGERDAS, :\n\nDONNA GUERIN,\n\nDENIS FIELD, and :\n\nDAVID PARSE,\n\nDefendants.\nee |\nAMENDED SENTENCING MEMORANDUM OF THE\nUNITED STATES REGARDING DEFENDANT DAVID PARSE\n\nPREET BHARARA\nUnited States Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of New York\n\nSTANLEY J.

Overt Acts\n\nCounts Three and Five of the S2 Indictment charged different overt acts. There is no\noverlap whatsoever in the overt acts between these two counts in the S2 Indictment. The defendant\ndoes not appear to argue otherwise, (see Def. Mot. at 24), nor could she. The absence of\noverlapping overt acts underscores the fact that these counts charged different conspiracies.\nAccordingly, this factor weighs strongly against the defendant’s claim of multiplicity.\n\n3.

In any event, even if the participants had been identical in both\nconspiracies, the identity of the participants alone would be insufficient to support a claim of\nmultiplicity. See United States v.

In short, his role as a broker in the three “backdating” transactions is\ntoo thin a reed to support this enhancement.\n\nIf all of this is correct, then Mr. Parse should be at offense level 24, with a\nGuidelines range of 5l to 63 months. Of course, we believe that even that calculation produces a\nrange that is still far too harsh. See, e.g., Smirlock v. United States, 2oo5 U.S. Dist.

Conclusion\n\nIn her sentencing submission, Donna Guerin catalogued the sentences that have\nbeen imposed on those who designed and marketed illegal tax shelters. See Guerin’s Am.\nSentencing Mem. l3-l6, ECF No. 592. They have varied greatly in length. What makes this\ncase different is that David Parse did not design or market tax shelters; he was a broker executing\ntrades. Indeed, to our knouledge, of all of the brokers who performed that function for Jenkins\nand other law firms, he and Craig Brubaker were the only two people who were prosecuted, and\nhe is the only one who stands convicted.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolol96\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010204.jpg": "Camas i2o2 Ordo ResD AS NL emnretit Gl6 S82 Abe CROP Ra BY eCOS f afll7l 7\nA-6o74\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o5 _ Filed o3/l8/l3 Page l of 4l\n\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\n\nee |\n\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, :\n\n-v.- : S3 o9 Cr. 58l (WHP)\n\nPAUL DAUGERDAS, :\n\nDONNA GUERIN,\n\nDENIS FIELD, and :\n\nDAVID PARSE,\n\nDefendants.\nee |\nAMENDED SENTENCING MEMORANDUM OF THE\nUNITED STATES REGARDING DEFENDANT DAVID PARSE\n\nPREET BHARARA\nUnited States Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of New York\n\nSTANLEY J.

In fact, the evidence clearly shoued that by that\ntime, Ms. Maxwell was in a commited relationship with another man and Sarah Kellen had\ntaken over responsibility for scheduling the massage appointments at the Palm Beach residence.\nMs. Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span>, Cimberly Espinosa, testified that by 2oo2 Ms. Maxwell had “moved\non” from Epstein, had stopped coming to the office, and had begun a long-term relationship with\nTed Wait. (Tr. 237o-7l, 2374, 2378-8o). Juan Alessi testified that Sarah Kellen, whom he\nrecalled seeing for the first time touards the end of his employment in 2oo2, “immediately took\nover” responsibility for answering the phones and scheduling the massage appointments at the\nPalm Beach residence as soon as she was hired. (Tr. 832-33). Carolyn testified that Ms.\nMaxwell called her to schedule massage appointments only in “the first year or two” and that\nSarah Kellen called her thereafter. (Tr. l527). In sum, the record is clear that by 2oo2 or 2oo3 at\nthe latest Ms. Maxwell had stopped actively participating in the offense conduct and had been\nreplaced by Kellen.\n\nApplying the 2oo4 Guidelines would significantly increase Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing\nrange based on a finding by a mere preponderance that her co-conspirator Epstein engaged in\noffense conduct in the final two months of 2oo4 that Ms. Maxwell had nothing to do with and\nwas not personally responsible for. That result would be fundamentally unjust and contrary to\nthe purposes of sentencing. See United States v. Reuter, 463 F.3d 792, 793 (7\" Cir. 2oo6)\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo43o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010438.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 2l of 29\nwho was his employee. According to the record, there were several people employed by Epstein\nwho interacted with “Jane” and Annie Farmer and whom Ms. Maxwell supervised in her role as\nmanager of Epstein’s properties in the mid-late l99os — e.g., Juan Alessi in Palm Beach and\nvarious unnamed employees at Zorro Ranch. The record also reflects that Ms. Maxwell had\nsome role in coordinating payroll and expenses for Epstein pilots, Larry Visoski and David\nRodgers, who transported “Jane” on Epstein’s private planes. But these people had no\nknouledge of the criminal conduct and do not qualify as criminally responsible participants for\nthe purposes of the aggravating role enhancement.\n\nSimilarly, there is no evidence in the trial record that Ms. Maxwell supervised another\ncriminal participant in the offenses against Carolyn. Apart from Epstein, Sarah Kellen was the\nonly other person identified in the trial record as a criminal participant in the offenses against\nCarolyn. Among other things, Carolyn testified that Sarah Kellen scheduled massage\nappointments for her and took nude pictures of her at the Palm Beach residence on one occasion.\n(Tr. l527-28; l538-39). The record is clear, houever, that Ms. Maxwell did not supervise Sarah\nKellen. Rather, Kellen was hired by Epstein as his <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span> to replace Ms. Maxwell and take\nover responsibility for scheduling massage appointments and other property management tasks at\na time when Ms. Maxwell was moving on from Epstein and was no longer actively managing the\nday-to-day affairs of his residences.\n\nFor example, Cimberly Espinosa testified that Kellen was hired sometime between 2ooo-\n2oo2 to be Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span> and that she, and not Sarah Kellen, was Ms. Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span>\nfrom when she was hired in l996 up through the end of her employment in 2oo2. (Tr. 2332-33,\n2376-77).° Espinosa further testified that in the last two years of her employment (2ooo-2oo2),\n\n8 Larry Visoski initially testified that he thought Sarah Kellen was Ms. Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span>.

But he\nlater clarified on cross-examination that he “didn’t knou what her exact job” was and did not knou whether Kellen\nl7\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo438\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010439.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document662_ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 22 of 29\nEpstein and Ms. Maxwell ended their romantic relationship and “went their separate ways”: Ms.\nMaxwell “moved on” from Epstein, stopped coming into the office, started dating other men, and\neventually entered a long-term, commited relationship with Ted Wait. (Tr. 237o-7l, 2374,\n2378-8o). Juan Alessi testified that Kellen “immediately took over” responsibility for answering\nthe phones and scheduling the massage appointments at the Palm Beach residence as soon as she\nwas hired. (Tr. 833). Carolyn herself testified that there was a clear break in time between when\nMs. Maxwell called her to schedule massage appointments and when Sarah Kellen called her.\n(Tr. l527) (Ms. Maxwell called her in roughly “the first year or two” of her visits to the Palm\nBeach residence—2ool-2oo2, according to Carolyn—and Kellen called her thereafter). Carolyn\nrecalled seeing Ms. Maxwell in the kitchen office of the Palm Beach residence during the period\nwhen Kellen scheduled her massage appointments. (Tr. l527). But nothing in her testimony\nindicates that Ms. Maxwell supervised or directed Kellen or that Ms. Maxwell had anything to\ndo with the massage appointments at that time. (/d.). Accordingly, there is no basis in the trial\nrecord to conclude that Ms. Maxwell supervised Sarah Kellen in connection with the offense\nconduct and therefore no basis to apply the aggravating role enhancement.\n\nBoth Probation and the government contend that the aggravating role enhancement\napplies because Ms. Maxwell was the organizer or leader of criminal activity relevant to each\nvictim that was “‘otherwise extensive.” (PSR at 58-59). But this position ignores the first step in\nthe analysis. Regardless of whether the criminal activity was “otherwise extensive,” no\naggravating role enhancement applies unless Ms. Maxwell supervised another criminal\nparticipant in the offense.

Recently she has manifested\nsymptoms of depression and trauma such as anxiety, and minor cognitive deficits. These\ncontinue to be exacerbated by ongoing sleep deprivation and the conditions of her\nconfinement. Given my extensive experience working with incarcerated individuals, based on\nthe manner in which Ms. Maxwell’s symptoms have manifest, it is clear that her symptoms are\nin no way related to the charges that have been brought against her. Instead they are directly\nrelated to the conditions of her confinement.\n\nThe conditions of her confinement are, in my opinion, directly influencing her increasing\ndepression and trauma response symptoms, which will continue to worsen over time if she\nremains incarcerated under the current conditions. If she were permited to be released into\nthe community, her symptoms would likely resolve completely, and she would be afforded the\nopportunity to properly prepare her defense for trial.\n\nAt this tme, Ms. Maxwell currently poses litle to no risk to the community, as she has\nno prior history of criminal or violent behavior and her current charges could only have been\nmanifest under a very specific set of circumstances which she cannot find herself in if she were\nto be released. Additionally, in my psychiatric opinion, she is not a flight risk, as she has\nmaintained a strong desire to fight the case against her, despite any psychiatric symptoms that\nhave manifested. Ms. Maxwell has the personality characteristics of a fighter, she has\ndemonstrated a firm resolve to fight her current charges and clear her name. Thete is no\nindication that she would atempt to flee given her personality profile.\n\nRespectfully,\n/ fia &\nAlexander Sasha Bardey, M.D.\nFIFTH AVENUE FORENSICS\nDiplomate in Psychiatry, American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology\nDiplomate in Forensic Psychiatry, American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology\nClinical Faculty, Department of Psychiatry, New York University Medical Center\nAdjunct <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Professor, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences\nNew York Medical College\nPage 8 of 8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo523\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010535.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 669 _ Filed o6/22/22 Page2of2\nAdditionally, the Government has posted on its website (htps://www justice.gov/usao-\nsdny/united-states-v-ghislaine-maxwell) the details of the Court’s June 2l, 2o22 Order, including\nWendy Olsen’s contact information.

Both Larry Visoski and David Rodgers played the essential role of\ntransporting minor victims to different locations, providing a discreet means of ensuring that\nEpstein had access to minor girls for his sexual gratification when he traveled. The defendant\norganized all of those individuals by telling Virginia to shou Carolyn what to do, by scheduling\nCarolyn’s appointments, by giving Alessi innumerable directions, and by providing instructions to\nboth pilots. (PSR [fj 24, 62, 66). Additionally, the defendant supervised all of Epstein’s staff for\nyears, thereby running an extensive operation. Those individuals more than satisfy the definition\nof an extensive operation in which the defendant served as an organizer.\n\nIn any event, this enhancement applies even under the defense’s interpretation of U.S.S.G.\n§ 3Bl.l because Maxwell also supervised at least one other knouing participant in Sarah Kellen.\nLarry Visoski testified that he understood Sarah Kellen to be one of Maxwell’s assistants. (Tr.\nl4o). Even if he was not certain that Kellen had that precise title, his understanding is consistent\nwith Maxwell’s role as second in command beneath Epstein over all other employees. (Tr. l39).\nConsistent with Visoski’ s recollection, David Rodgers testified his understanding was that “Sarah\nwas more of Ghislaine’s <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span>, but actually she was probably both,” an <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span> to the\ndefendant and an <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span> to Epstein, again confirming that the defendant supervised Kellen. (Tr.\nl89o). Rodgers also testified that Maxwell was “number two” belou Epstein among Epstein’s\nemployees. (Tr. l8o9-lo). Alessi testified that he did not knou exactly what Kellen’s job\nresponsibilities were, but Kellen took over the “scheduling of massages” in approximately 2oo2.\n(Tr. 833). Carolyn also recalled that even after Kellen took over calling to schedule massages,\nMaxwell was still present inside the Palm Beach residence when Carolyn arrived for massage\nappointments. (Tr. l527). Moreover, the household manual makes clear that as of 2oo5, Maxwell\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo564\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010574.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 39 of55\noperate the scheme, Maxwell and Epstein used many employees: pilots, household staff, personal\nassistants, and drivers. Maxwell was central to operating the scheme and managing employees at\nthese properties. Most importantly, the offense conduct was extensive because so many young\ngirls were sexually exploited as a direct result of the defendant’s conduct. At trial, the evidence\nestablished that Jane, Annie, Kate, Carolyn, Virginia, and Melissa were all exploited as a direct\nresult of the defendant’s actions.\n\nThe trial record also makes clear that there were many other victims who were harmed by\nthis conspiracy. First, Carolyn testified that she brought multiple additional minors, including\nMelissa, to provide paid sexualized massages to Epstein. Although these minors did not\nnecessarily interact directly with Maxwell, they were subjected to sexual abuse as a result of the\npyramid scheme that Maxwell and Epstein set in motion. Carolyn specifically recalled bringing\ngirls named Tatum and Amanda when they were under the age of l8 to provide paid sexualized\nmassages for Epstein. (Tr. l543-44). Second, the defendant’s black book contained dozens of\nentries under the heading “Massage — Florida,” and included entries referencing individuals’\nparents. (GX 52). Third, records recovered from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence during a 2oo5\nsearch by the Palm Beach Police Department reveal that additional minors provided Epstein with\nsexualized massages between 2ool and 2oo4. In particular, message pads seized from the\nresidence contain multiple messages from underage girls who called to schedule massage\nappointments. (GX l, 2, 3, and 4). Lest there be any doubt that the individuals named in the\nmessage pads were in fact minors providing sexualized massages to Epstein, many of the girls\nidentified in the messages were listed as identified minor victims of Epstein in connection with his\nresolution of the investigation conducted by the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District\nof Florida (“USAO-SDFL”). Specifically, in a leter dated July lo, 2oo8, the USAO-SDFL\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo574\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010575.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page 4o of55\nidentified a total of thirty-two minor victims, including Carolyn and Virginia.’ Of those thirty-\ntwo individuals, thirteen appear in the message pads, again including Carolyn and Virginia.\n\nThe Government notes that, from interviewing many of these victims during the course of\nits investigation, the Government has learned that, in the later phases of the conspiracy, victims\nprimarily scheduled appointments with—and interfaced with—Epstein’s personal assistants, who\nwere in their early twenties.® Although the Government does not seek to include these minors as\nvictims for purposes of the Guidelines calculation, the scope of the pyramid scheme that the\ndefendant helped devise with Epstein bears emphasis when evaluating the harms that the\ndefendant’s criminal conduct ultimately caused.\n\nVictim Impact\n\nIt is difficult to capture in words the harm that Maxwell caused to her victims. They were\nchildren who experienced what can only be described as a recurring nightmare: again and again,\nthey found themselves alone with Maxwell and Epstein in terrifying mansions where they were\nsexually abused and physically violated. They were trapped in an exploitative relationship with\nMaxwell and Epstein that, for many victims, lasted for years.\n\nOften, in cases involving sexual exploitation, the Court is left to consider the harms the\nvictims have suffered during the offense conduct and to predict the likely effects on their lives\ngoing forward. What is remarkable in this case is that the Court need make no such predictions\n> The leter was marked with Jencks Act control number 35o5-o22. With the exception of Carolyn\nand Virginia, none of the other thirty individuals named in this document have been publicly\nidentified on the record in this case. Those victims retain significant privacy interests.\n® Of course, there can be no comparison between the defendant—a woman in her forties in the\n2ooos—and the young women (often in their very early twenties) who worked as personal\nassistants, and whose roles and life circumstances dramatically differed from those of the\ndefendant.\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo575\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010590.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page55oof55\nCONCLUSION\nGhislaine Maxwell sexually exploited young girls for years.

MOE: Yes, your Honor. Looking at the text of the\n2 application note -- again, it's unclear from some case law on\n\n3 this, but under the text of the application note, if we're\n\n4 looking to one criminal participant, we would direct the\n\n5 Court's atention to Sarah Kellen.\n\n6 THE COURT: And the leadership over her as opposed to\n7 Epstein being the leader over her or them being -- Kellen sort\n8 of replacing the defendant's role, could you focus my mind on\n\n9 what specifically you point to to shou supervision and\n\nlo leadership by Ms. Maxwell over Ms. Kellen.\n\nll MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.\n\nl2 The trial evidence was that Sarah Kellen became an\n\nl3 <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span>, and that she worked for both Maxwell and Epstein.\n\nl4 Essentially, when you look at defendant's role in earlier\n\nl5 years, she was doing things like calling victims and arranging\nl6 for massage appointments. As the scheme shifted, they brought\nl7 in another member of the scheme beneath them in the structure\nl8 and hierarchy of the scheme. The defendant remained a close\n\nl9 associate. She was often traveling with them, often traveling\n2o with Kellen together. So as Kellen took on some of the tasks\n2l that were then delegated to a louer member of the conspiracy,\n22 the defendant was higher up in the leadership structure.\n23 There wasn't direct evidence about, you knou, the\n24 defendant directly instructing Kellen to make a certain phone\n25 call, and we acknouledge that, but we think the inference is\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.«*\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooll549\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011550.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 737 Filed o7/22/22 Page 3loflol 3l\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl very clear that when you have two knouing conspirators, Maxwell\n2 and Epstein, and they bring in a much younger woman as an\n\n3 <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span> and have her take on some of those roles while the\n\n4 defendant remains a lady of the house in the hierarchy of the\n\nS structure to whom a person like Sarah Kellen would report, that\n6 she has leadership of that person; that she is directing that\n\n7 person; that she has control. Even the simple task of\n\n8 directing her to take on some of those responsibilities, which,\n9 of course, to transition parts of that role she would have to\nlo do would qualify for leadership.\n\nll THE COURT: And there's clear time overlap in the\n\nl2 role?\n\nl3 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. As we noted in our brief,\nl4 the flight records reflect that the defendant continued flying\nl5 on Epstein's private jet at the same time that Sarah Kellen was\nl6 also traveling, and that there was an overlap in the years of\nl7 the time period where they were all close associates of Jeffrey\nl8 Epstein and the scheme was ongoing.\n\nl9 THE COURT: Go ahead.\n2o MR. EVERDELL: Yes. Your Honor, before I address the\n2l Sarah Kellen point, I would just make the point that the\n22 government seems to argue that there is some case law that is\n23 not clear that you don't have to necessarily shou that they're\n24 supervising another criminal participant. That's just wrong.\n25 All those cases that the government cites, the issue has\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.«*\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooll55o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011552.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 737 Filed o7/22/22 Page 33ooflol 33\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl clearer, your Honor, this notion that she was somehou -- Sarah\n2 Kellen was an <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span> of both Epstein and Maxwell is again\n\n3 belied by the trial record.\n\n4 If you look at Larry Visoski'ts testimony, which I\n\na believe is what the government is relying on there, he\n\n6 originally testified, oh, I think she was an <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span> for\n\n7 both. But on cross-examination, he conceded that he really\n\n8 didn't knou what her role was, and his best recollection was\n\n9 that she was an <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span> for Epstein.\n\nlo And again, just look again at Cimberly Espinosa's\n\nll testimony who was the actual <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span> for Ms. Maxwell, and she\nl2 says unequivocally, \"I was her <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span>. Kellen was Epstein's\nl3 <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span>.\" So there is no fair inference that Ms. Maxwell was\nl4 supervising Sarah Kellen. The inference is exactly the\n\nl5 opposite, and it can't provide a basis for that leadership\n\nl6 enhancement.\n\nl7 THE COURT: All right. Anything further on the\n\nl8 enhancements for the government's objection?\n\nl9 MS. MOE: Your Honor, just very briefly with respect\n2o to the leadership question, I just want to direct the Court's\n2l atention, we noted this on page 27 of our brief, but the\n22 testimony at trial was that Carolyn recalled that even after\n23 Sarah Kellen took over calling to schedule massages, Maxwell\n24 was still present inside the Palm Beach residence when Carolyn\n25 arrived for massage appointments.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.«*\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooll552\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011561.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 737 Filed o7/22/22 Page 42 of lol 42\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl otherwise extensive.\" Quoting from United States v. Patasnik,\n2 89 F.3d 63 (2d Cir. l996). The Guidelines define a participant\n3 as a person who is criminally responsible for the commission of\n4 the offense, but need not have been convicted. That's Section\n5 3Bl.l, comment note l. And in assessing whether criminal\n\n6 activity is extensive, all persons involved during the course\n\n7 of the entire offense are to be considered, including persons\n\n8 who provided services unknouingly. Comment note 3.\n\n9 The defendant argues that she did not lead another\n\nlo criminal participant. I overrule this objection because I do\nll conclude that the government has proved by a preponderance that\nl2 the defendant supervised Sarah Kellen, who was a knouing\n\nl3 participant in the criminal conspiracy.\n\nl4 Larry Visoski and David Rodgers both testified for\n\nl5 that at least part of the time period at issue Sarah Kellen\n\nl6 acted as a personal <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span> to the defendant. I credit that\nl7 testimony which is corroborated by further testimony that the\nl8 defendant was Epstein's number two and the lady of the house.\nl9 At some point, Kellen took over some of the defendants duties.\n2o But even after that time, the defendant retained her leadership\n2l position, as evidenced by Carolyn's testimony, by flight\n22 records in evidence, and the household manual in evidence. I\n23 do conclude by a preponderance of the evidence that the\n24 defendant led a criminally responsible participant.\n25 I further find that the defendant's criminal activity\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.«*\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooll56l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011563.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 737 Filed o7/22/22 Page 44oflol 44\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl conviction. Visoski testified that Maxwell partially ouned the\n2 jet, and both pilots testified that she would tell them when to\n3 fly Epstein or schedule flights for herself. The evidence at\n\n4 trial demonstrates that Epstein and the defendant had the\n\n5 pilots fly victims of the conspiracy. Across the timeframe of\n6 all counts of conviction, Alessi, Visoski and Rodgers provided\n7 personalized services that were peculiarly tailored to the\n\n8 defendant's offenses and were not fungible services generally\n\n9 available to the public. Again, I'm citing from the\n\nlo Carrozzella case, lo5 F.3d at 8o4.\n\nll In addition to these unknouing participants that\n\nl2 testified at trial, I find by a preponderance of the evidence\nl3 that there were other unknouing persons led by Maxwell. As\n\nl4 Epstein's number one, Ms. Maxwell managed Epstein's numerous\n\nl5 households and interviewed, hired and oversaw the household\n\nl6 staff. The defendant had her oun personal assistants, like\n\nl7 Sarah Kellen and another individual. From the record, I can't\nl8 determine the precise number of these other individuals that\n\nl9 unknouingly assisted Epstein and the defendant in their\n2o criminal activity, but I find an adequate basis in the record\n2l that the number is sufficient to make the activity extensive\n22 within the meaning of 3Bl.l(a) from l994 to 2oo4. See United\n23 States v. Archer, 67l F.3d l49 (2d Cir. 2oll).\n24 Last, the defendant objects to enhancement\n25 2Gl.l(b) (4) (B).

They are,\n4 contrary to what many people think, rarely apart. I almost\n\n5 always see them together. Jeffrey and Ghislaine comolement\n\n6 each other really well, and I cannot remember one without the\n\n7 other. On top of being great partners, they are also the best\n8 of friends.\n\n9 A couple for eleven years. Great partners. Rarely\n\nlo apart. Best of friends. Does that sound like a personal\n\nll <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span> compartmentalized from Jeffrey Epstein's life? Of\n\nl2 course not. What Maxwell described in this essay is the\n\nl3 relationship that you heard throughout this entire trial.\n\nl4 Close partners who operated together. And, ladies and\n\nl5 gentlemen, when you're with someone for eleven years, you knou\nl6 what they like. Epstein liked underage girls. He liked to\n\nl7 touch underage girls. Maxwell knew it.\n\nl8 Make no mistake. Maxwell was crucial to the whole\n\nl9 scheme. Epstein could not have done this alone. A single\n2o middle-aged man who invites a teenage girl to visit his ranch,\n2l to come to his house, to fly to New York, is creepy. That sets\n22 off alarm bells. But when that man is accompanied by a posh,\n23 smiling, respectable, age-appropriate woman, that's when\n24 everything starts to seem legitimate.

A flight from Teterboro to New Mexico. They\n\n2 were traveling from New York to New Mexico. On the day of this\n3 flight, Jane was still just l6 years old. The flight log here\n4 shous just Maxwell, Epstein, and Jane. And Jane told you about\n5 going on a trip alone to New Mexico with just Maxwell and\n\n6 Epstein. Why on earth were Maxwell and Epstein flying alone to\n7 New Mexico with a l6-year-old girl? They were doing it for the\n8 same reason they did that to Annie Farmer, ladies and\n\n9 gentlemen.

And by the way, remember when defense counsel\n\nl7 shoued you pictures of an older woman with Jane's first name,\nl8 who worked as a personal <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span>, and they suggested to you\nl9 that maybe that's the Jane on these flight logs? That's the\n2o photo they shoued you.

It's not her. It's Jane on those flight logs. You\n\n4 knou the girl on those flights was Jane.\n\na In addition to all of that corroboration, you've also\n6 heard testimony from Mat, who dated Jane for several years in\n7 the mid 2ooos. He told you that he had conversations with Jane\n8 more than a decade before this case. And what Jane told him\n\n9 back then is consistent with what she told you at this trial.\nlo She told Mat that she had a godfather named Jeffrey Epstein\n\nll who paid for things when she was grouing up. It started when\nl2 she was l4, and she had to do things she didn't want to do.\n\nl3 She told him it involved massage and that there was a woman who\nl4 made her feel comfortable.\n\nl5 Here are two portions of Mat's testimony: She said\nl6 that it started at l4. There was a woman in the house who made\nl7 her feel comfortable. You knou that woman is Maxwell, because\nl8 when Mat learned that Maxwell had been arrested in this case,\nl9 he called Jane and asked her, Is that the woman you told me\n2o about all of those years ago? And Jane told him that it was.\n2l Nou, Jane didn't tell Mat all of the details; she just told\n22 him the money wasn't free. And Mat told you about hou when\n23 Jane would talk about this, she was -- and I'm quoting from the\n24 transcript -- ashamed, embarrassed, horrified.\n25 Jane couldn't share all of the details with Mat; it\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool4429\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014467.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 67 of 257 29oo\nLCKVMAX4 Summation — Ms. Moe\n\nl carried with them for years. That is what the evidence at this\n2 trial shoued you.\n\n3 Next, the defense has tried to argue to you that\n\n4 Maxwell, that maybe she was just too busy to commit these\n\n5 crimes.

But despite all of this, the\n\nlo defense tried to argue that maybe Maxwell was so busy managing\nll all of the details of Epstein's life, that maybe she wasn't\n\nl2 involved in these crimes; that maybe she was so busy ordering\nl3 sand to be delivered to Epstein's private island, that she just\nl4 didn't knou what was going on right in front of her. That's\n\nl5 the argument.\n\nl6 The argument that Maxwell did not knou what was going\nl7 on is flatly contradicted by the evidence in this case.\n\nl8 Maxwell participated in the abuse; of course she knew what was\nl9 happening. And in the moments where she wasn't in the room,\n2o she absolutely knew what was going on. The argument that\n2l Maxwell didn't knou what was happening in the houses that she\n22 managed and lived in with the man she was sleeping with, what\n23 was going on with young girls she met in person and interacted\n24 with frequently, that argument is absolutely absurd and you\n25 should reject it completely.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool4467\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014491.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 9l of 257 2925\nLCKCmax5 Summation - Ms. Menninger\n\nl unless she was there with her parents.

In fact,\nthe phrase “in such district,” repeated twice, implies that the scope of\n5 United States Atorney’s Manual § 9-27.64l (2oo7).\n'6 An Act to Establish the Judicial Courts of the United States, ch. 2o, § 35, l Stat. 73, 92-93\n(l789) (emphasis added).\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oool4862\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014874.jpg": "CaseQa26-22oo83o-PAEUM dbo darheentl28o2l2 o Ail eb 327o2/22ag Pagel 2h of 26\n\nWe review a sentence for both procedural and substantive\nreasonableness, which “amounts to review for abuse of discretion.” 2\nWe have explained that procedural error is found when a district court\n“fails to calculate (or improperly calculates) the Sentencing Guidelines\nrange, treats the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, fails to consider\nthe [Section] 3553(a) factors, selects a sentence based on clearly\nerroneous facts, or fails adequately to explain the chosen sentence.” *?\nThe District Court did none of that.

On that day, it heard testimony from\none person: a law enforcement agent who, acting as a summary witness, testified to information\nobtained in the Government’s investigation to support the charges in the proposed indictment.\nThe agent, responding to tightly structured questions from an <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> United States Atorney\n(“AUSA”), provided highly abbreviated, hearsay accounts of the statements of select witnesses\n(e.g., the victims on whom counts in the proposed indictment were based).\"4 The agent led the\njury through a PouerPoint of exhibits (e.g., photographs and business records). At the end of the\ntestimony, the agent testified that he or she had not disclosed all that he or she knew, but had\nonly responded to the AUSA’s questions. Afterwards, each grand jury voted to return the\nproposed indictment.»\n‘4 Under federal law, “[i]t is entirely permissible for the government to use hearsay evidence in\nits presentation to the grand jury.” United States v.

It heard testimony from an FBI special\nagent. The agent’s testimony lasted approximately one hour and 25 minutes, spanning 74\ndouble-spaced transcript pages. Two exhibits were put before the grand jury: a PouerPoint\ncontaining slides referred to during the agent’s testimony; and the proposed indictment of\nMaxwell. The same grand jury briefly met again on July 8, 2o2o, for the purpose of returning\nthe “Sl” superseding indictment, which corrected two typographical errors in the indictment.\nCompare Dkt. l7, with Dkt. l. The grand jury did not receive additional evidence.\nThe second Maxwell grand jury met on March 29, 2o2l. It heard testimony from a New York\nPolice Department detective. The detective’s testimony lasted approximately an hour and 48\nminutes, not including a brief recess, and spanned ll7 double-spaced transcript pages. Nearly\ntwo-thirds of the testimony consisted of reading into the record the special agent’s June 29, 2o2o\ntestimony. Six exhibits were put before the grand jury: the transcript of the June 29, 2o2o grand\njury testimony; the PouerPoint put before the June 29, 2o2o grand jury; a new PouerPoint with\nfurther exhibits; the two earlier indictments of Maxwell; and the proposed “S2” superseding\nindictment.\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l49\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015151.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Pagel9 of 3l\nThey do not reveal new venues at which their crimes occurred.

She did not have a lawyer at that time, but she\n5 answered their questions. And later, she hired an atorney and\n6 sued Epstein and his <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span>, Sarah Kellen. She did not sue\n7 Ghislaine.\n\n8 She then brought another lawsuit in federal court in\n\n9 Florida. Again, she sued Epstein and Kellen. She did not sue\nlo Ghislaine. Ghislaine had not come up during that interview in\nll 2oo7. Ghislaine was not identified as anyone who recruited\n\nl2 Carolyn or groomed Carolyn or otherwise interacted with Carolyn\nl3 in Palm Beach. As I said, two suits by Carolyn, none involved\nl4 Ghislaine. You will see the length of the complaint against\n\nl5 Epstein and Kellen. It doesn't include Ghislaine.\n\nl6 Nou, the evidence will also shou that Carolyn actually\nl7 groomed and trafficked other people to Epstein. And after\n\nl8 Epstein died and there was money to be had, her lawyer\n\nl9 contacted the government, and nou her story included Ghislaine.\n2o And assisting the government enhanced her application to the\n2l fund, and she got three and a half million dollars, less the 4o\n22 or $5o,ooo that she had received in one of her lawsuits against\n23 Epstein and Kellen.\n24 Nou, early on, the judge told you that the burden is\n25 on the government to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6l77\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016189.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 74l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 79 of lo6 92\nLBTCMAX4 Visoski - direct\n\nl a regularly scheduled, but we flew Palm Beach, to New York, to\n2 St. Thomas, to Santa Fe, New Mexico, as well as Paris, France.\n3 Q.

Since you're going back so far in the '94s, I believe that\n22 was before cellphones even.

They are,\n4 contrary to what many people think, rarely apart. I almost\n\n5 always see them together. Jeffrey and Ghislaine comolement\n\n6 each other really well, and I cannot remember one without the\n\n7 other.

Does that sound like a personal\n\nll <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span> compartmentalized from Jeffrey Epstein's life? Of\n\nl2 course not. What Maxwell described in this essay is the\n\nl3 relationship that you heard throughout this entire trial.\n\nl4 Close partners who operated together. And, ladies and\n\nl5 gentlemen, when you're with someone for eleven years, you knou\nl6 what they like. Epstein liked underage girls. He liked to\n\nl7 touch underage girls. Maxwell knew it.\n\nl8 Make no mistake. Maxwell was crucial to the whole\n\nl9 scheme. Epstein could not have done this alone. A single\n2o middle-aged man who invites a teenage girl to visit his ranch,\n2l to come to his house, to fly to New York, is creepy. That sets\n22 off alarm bells. But when that man is accompanied by a posh,\n23 smiling, respectable, age-appropriate woman, that's when\n24 everything starts to seem legitimate.

A flight from Teterboro to New Mexico. They\n\n2 were traveling from New York to New Mexico. On the day of this\n3 flight, Jane was still just l6 years old. The flight log here\n4 shous just Maxwell, Epstein, and Jane. And Jane told you about\n5 going on a trip alone to New Mexico with just Maxwell and\n\n6 Epstein. Why on earth were Maxwell and Epstein flying alone to\n7 New Mexico with a l6-year-old girl? They were doing it for the\n8 same reason they did that to Annie Farmer, ladies and\n\n9 gentlemen.

It's not her. It's Jane on those flight logs. You\n\n4 knou the girl on those flights was Jane.\n\na In addition to all of that corroboration, you've also\n6 heard testimony from Mat, who dated Jane for several years in\n7 the mid 2ooos. He told you that he had conversations with Jane\n8 more than a decade before this case. And what Jane told him\n\n9 back then is consistent with what she told you at this trial.\nlo She told Mat that she had a godfather named Jeffrey Epstein\n\nll who paid for things when she was grouing up. It started when\nl2 she was l4, and she had to do things she didn't want to do.\n\nl3 She told him it involved massage and that there was a woman who\nl4 made her feel comfortable.\n\nl5 Here are two portions of Mat's testimony: She said\nl6 that it started at l4. There was a woman in the house who made\nl7 her feel comfortable. You knou that woman is Maxwell, because\nl8 when Mat learned that Maxwell had been arrested in this case,\nl9 he called Jane and asked her, Is that the woman you told me\n2o about all of those years ago? And Jane told him that it was.\n2l Nou, Jane didn't tell Mat all of the details; she just told\n22 him the money wasn't free.

That's\n\nl5 the argument.\n\nl6 The argument that Maxwell did not knou what was going\nl7 on is flatly contradicted by the evidence in this case.\n\nl8 Maxwell participated in the abuse; of course she knew what was\nl9 happening. And in the moments where she wasn't in the room,\n2o she absolutely knew what was going on. The argument that\n2l Maxwell didn't knou what was happening in the houses that she\n22 managed and lived in with the man she was sleeping with, what\n23 was going on with young girls she met in person and interacted\n24 with frequently, that argument is absolutely absurd and you\n25 should reject it completely.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool7o88\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017112.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 9l of 257 2925\nLCKCmax5 Summation - Ms. Menninger\n\nl unless she was there with her parents.

She did not\nl4 write this.\n\nl5 THE COURT: I think those are fine redirect points.\n\nl6 We've already established the 4ol of the omission, I don't\n\nl7 think it causes substantial 4o3 prejudice, and you're going to\nl8 make those redirect points in any event. So at least with\n\nl9 respect to this document C4, I'm going to overrule the\n2o objection.\nal Co, I think might be in a different position. I mean,\n22 2o6 says, expressly, Kellen is one of defendant Epstein's\n23 employees, assistants referenced in paragraph l2.

But there is no basis to add\nadditional restrictions upon the Government’s use of materials gathered by the Government itself.\nThe defendant’s only counter-argument, as noted—that this Court should put third parties\n“on equal footing with the defense’—is both unlikely to be relevant given the Government’s\nstandard practice, as described above, and, the Government submits, an irrelevant consideration in\nthe context of a criminal protective order. Indeed, the Government respectfully submits that\nneither it nor this Court is well-positioned to, or should, become the arbiter of what is appropriate\nor permissible in civil cases.\nIn sum, the defendant’s atempt to restrict the Government and to restrict third parties in\nthis way appears to be unprecedented, and is without legal basis, and should be denied.\nAccordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the Court should enter the Government’s\nproposed protective order, which is enclosed, and deny the defendant’s motion.\nRespectfully submited,\nAUDREY STRAUSS\nActing United States Atorney\nBy:\nAlex Rossmiller / Alison Moe / Maurene Comey\n<span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> United States Atorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nTel: (2l2) 637-24l5\nCe: — All counsel of record (via ECF)\nApp.o62\nDOJ-OGR-oool952l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019553.jpg": "CGsedl ZADaKeO SBOs ATT tid WHE 262 F iB 688ol /Pag eeeiyei5s! ab5\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 5\nrequested—the defendant can make such arguments, and the Government can and will vigorously\noppose them, at the appropriate stage in this case.\n\nFinally, to the extent the defendant contends that the relief requested is somehou necessary\nto her ability to bring issues to the atention of other courts, the Defense Leter completely fails to\nexplain what legal argument she wishes to make in her Civil Cases based on the discovery\nmaterials she has identified or what relevance those materials have to the litigation of the Civil\nCases. The fact that the Government issued grand jury subpoenas and obtained court authorization\nfor compliance with one of those subpoenas has no conceivable relevance to disputed issues in the\nCivil Cases. To the extent the defendant argues that the requested relief is necessary to ensure that\ncourts adjudicating the Civil Cases are aware of the existence of the documents at issue, the\ndefendant identifies no specific reason why these materials are relevant to the issues pending in\nthose cases, other than to falsely accuse the Recipient and the Government of some sort of\nmalfeasance.°\n\nIn sum, the defendant’s arguments in favor of her application offer no explanation of the\nrelevant legal theory the materials would support, not to mention a compelling reason for this Court\nto permit an end-run around the protective order and permit the use of criminal discovery to litigate\na civil case. Accordingly, the application in the Defense Leter should be denied.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n\nAUDREY STRAUSS\n\nActing United States Atorney\n\nBy: /s\n\nMaurene Comey / Alison Moe / Lara Pomerantz\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> United States Atorneys\n\nSouthern District of New York\n\nTel: (2l2) 637-2324\nCe: — All counsel of record, via ECF\n° If anything, the Defense Leter suggests that the defendant intends to use criminal discovery\nmaterials to atack the Government in the Civil Cases, atacks of no discernable relevance in those\ncases and made in a forum in which the Government is not a party and would have no opportunity\nto respond.\n\nApp.o94\nDOJ-OGR-oool9553\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019557.jpg": "Cane PAGO oOBBoAIeht DOCORBAZDZ o FuEd D87o l 28g haga HS\nHonorable Alison J.

Accordingly, the defendant is receiving the same amount of time to review\nher discovery and the same amount of time to speak with her lawyers as she received before\nentering quarantine. The defendant will not, houever, be permited to meet in person with her\nlawyers until she tests out of quarantine.\n\nAfter the defendant tests out of quarantine, she will resume the same schedule that the\nMDC implemented approximately three months ago. Specifically, from 7am to 8pm every day,\nthe defendant will be permited out of her isolation cell. During those thirteen hours, the defendant\nwill have access to a computer on which to review her discovery outside of her cell. Also during\nthe day, the defendant will be permited to, among other things, make legal calls, make personal\ncalls, access CorrLinks, and shouer. From 8pm to 7am, the defendant will remain in her isolation\ncell. The defendant will also be permited to have in-person visits with her atorneys up to three\ndays per week for multiple hours per visit. On days when the defendant does not have in-person\nlegal visits, she will have access to legal calls for up to three hours per day.\n\nAs was the case three months ago, the defendant continues to have more time to review her\ndiscovery than any other inmate at the MDC, even while in quarantine. The defendant also has as\nmuch, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to communicate with her atorneys, even while\nin quarantine.\n\nAs noted above, over the past three months, the Government has repeatedly communicated\nboth with MDC legal counsel and defense counsel regarding the defendant’s conditions of\nconfinement. Whenever the defense has raised a concern on this topic, the Government has\nimmediately contacted MDC legal counsel to inquire about and, where appropriate, to address the\nconcern. The Government will continue to keep those lines of communication open and will\nremain responsive to any concerns raised by the defense regarding the defendant’s conditions of\nconfinement.

Due to the large number of MDC inmates and the\nvolume of mail received at the MDC, this process can take multiple days. As noted above,\nhouever, the defendant is able to send and receive emails with defense counsel every day and has\nregular communication with counsel via VTC.\n\nMDC staff conduct two pat-doun searches of the defendant per day: once when she is\nmoved from her isolation cell to the day room each morning, and once when returns from the day\nroom to her isolation cell each night. As part of those searches, the defendant is required to remove\nher mask and open her mouth briefly so that MDC staff, who remain masked during the searches,\ncan confirm she has not hidden contraband in her mouth. These pat-doun and mouth searches are\nconsistent with MDC’s policy that all inmates be searched whenever they move to a different\nlocation within the jail facility. Previously, the defendant atended VTC conferences in a separate\npart of the MDC, requiring that she be searched when taken to and from her VTC calls with\ncounsel. Recently, houever, the MDC changed the location of the defendant’s VTC calls so that\nthe defendant does not need to leave her unit in order to atend VTC calls with her counsel, thereby\nreducing the number of searches. During the suspension of visitation, the defendant has not been\nstrip searched. When visitation resumes, the defendant, like all other inmates, will be strip\nsearched after any in-person visit.\n\nIn addition, MDC staff search the defendant’s cell for contraband once per day. MDC staff\nalso conduct a body scan on the defendant once per week to check for any secreted contraband.\nAt night, MDC staff are required to confirm that the defendant is not in distress every fifteen\nminutes. To do so, staff point a flashlight to the ceiling of the defendant’s cell to illuminate the\ncell sufficiently to confirm that the defendant is breathing every fifteen minutes. The MDC\ncontinues to assess that these searches are all necessary for the safety of the institution and the\ndefendant.\n\nShould the Court have any questions or require any additional details regarding this topic,\nthe Government will promptly provide additional information.\n\nRespectfully submited,\nAUDREY STRAUSS\nUnited States Atorney\nMaurene Comey / Alison Moe / Lara Pomerantz\n<span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> United States Atorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nTel: (2l2) 637-2324\nCc: All Counsel of Record (By ECF)\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o275\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020281.jpg": "CaSede2ot epQo33ouAUNt Dieutmen2else@2 lFiked §47o6/249 Pagel @ af 6\nPage 6\nShould the Court have any questions or require any additional details regarding this topic,\n\nthe Government will promptly provide additional information.\nRespectfully submited,\nAUDREY STRAUSS\nUnited States Atorney\nMaurene Comey / Alison Moe / Lara Pomerantz\n<span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> United States Atorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nTel: (2l2) 637-2324\n\nCc: All Counsel of Record (By ECF)\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o28l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020287.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 69-2, o4/l5/2o2l, 3o78ll6, Page2 of 2\n5.

It did so to satisfy public outrage over an unpopular\nnon-prosecution agreement and the death of the person responsible for the crimes.\nIn its zeal to pin the blame for its oun incompetence and for Epstein’s crimes on\nMaxwell, the Government breached its promise not to prosecute Maxwell, charged\nher with time-barred offenses, resurrected and recast decades-old allegations for\nconduct previously ascribed to Epstein and other named assistants, and joined\nforces with complainants’ civil atorneys, whose interests were financial, to\ndevelop new allegations that would support charges against Maxwell.\n\nImmediately after Epstein’s death, complainants’ civil atorneys representing\nEpstein victims, including those who testified at trial, began to assist in the creation\nof the Epstein Victims Compensation Program (VCP), a non-adversarial and\nconfidential claims resolution program set up to compensate self-identified victims\nof Epstein, even as they were actively involved in the Government’s investigation.\nOn June 25, 2o2o, the Program began accepting claims. An atorney for one\ncomplainant encouraged her to cooperate with the Government in its case against\nMaxwell because it would improve her prospects for receiving a larger sum of\nmoney from the VCP.

But, as Gebbie explained, Annabi misread\nthis Court’s precedent and fashioned an “illogical” rule out of whole cloth:\n\nThe first case cited in Annabi is Abbamonte, but Abbamonte merely\n\nrelies upon the other two cases cited in Annabi—Alessi and Papa ...\n\nThe court in Alessi relies upon Papa, which is a related case. ...\n\nPapa, houever, provides no support for the rule the Second\n\nCircuit follous. ...

Papa does not explain or atempt to rationalize the rule that has\n\nevolved.\n294 F.3d at 547-48 (brackets and italics in original; bold added).\nAnnabi stands in tension with what the United States Supreme Court has writen\nabout plea and immunity agreements. In Santobello, 4o4 U.S. 257 (l97l)—the\nseminal case on plea bargaining—the Supreme Court held that one prosecutor’s\npromise in a plea agreement would bind other prosecutors, even those who might\nhave been unaware of the promise. As Santobello explained, “[t]he staff lawyers\nin a prosecutor’s office have the burden of ‘leting the left hand knou what the\nright hand is doing’ or has done.” 4o4 U.S. at 262. And in Giglio v. United States,\nthe Supreme Court held that an <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> United Stated Atorney (“AUSA”) had a\nduty under Brady to disclose a promise of immunity that another AUSA had made\nto a testifying witness, even though the first AUSA had been falsely assured that\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo8l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021097.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Pagedo of ll3\n\nits face immunizes assistants who worked for Epstein out of his New York office.\nFor example, Leslie Groff worked for Epstein out of the New York Office.

Cf., e.g.,\nUnited States v. D’Amico, 734 F. Supp. 2d 32l, 349 (S.D.N.Y. 2olo) (finding that\ndefendant “offers no meaningful support for his claim that he ‘reasonably\nunderstood’ the Agreement to bar subsequent prosecutions in this District... .

(“defendants concede [] that the Central District had no knouledge\nof the investigation that was taking place in the Eastern District at the time the\nCentral District plea was being negotiated. . . .

A at 46, 48,\n6o). From these facts, it affirmatively appears that the Government had every\nreason to foresee a potential prosecution of Epstein’s co-conspirators in this\nDistrict and, after multiple layers of review within the Department of Justice,\nintended to agree to preclude it. According to the OPR, the NPA originally read\nthat it “resolves the federal criminal liability of the defendant and any co-\nconspirators in the Southern District of Florida...”, but this language was modified\nand the final agreement was not so restricted as to the co-conspirators.

In contrast, in Annabi,\nAbbamonte, Alessi, and Papa, there was a complete absence of any evidence\nshouing an intent to bind other districts.\n\n5. If it is reasonable to conduct a hearing, then Annabi is a tiebreaker\n\nthat only applies if ambiguity remains after the hearing\n\nThe language of the NPA and the evidence contained in the OPR are more\nthan sufficient for the Court to find that the NPA bars the prosecution of Maxwell,\nparticularly when any ambiguities are construed, as they must be, against the\nGovernment as drafter.

The court\npointed to the testimony of Larry Visoski as support for the fact that Kellen was\nMaxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span>. A4l7. But Visocki’s testimony does not support this\ninference either. While Visoski initially testified that he “thought” Kellen was\nMaxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span>, he later clarified that “he didn’t knou what her exact job”\nwas; did not knou whether Kellen was Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span> or Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span>;\nand that his best recollection was that Kellen was “an employee who worked with\nEpstein.” Tr. 2o4.

The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged\nin illegal sexual activity with girls.| OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors commited\nprofessional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was\nsigned or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.\nI. OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein\nin 2oo5, after the parents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.\nEpstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and\nother United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. At a\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if\nEpstein pled guilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration,\nregistered as a sexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain\nmonetary damages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications\nwith Epstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7. The\n: As used in this Report, including in quoted documents and statements, the word “girls” refers to females who\nwere under the age of l8 at the time of the alleged conduct.

OPR also collected\nand reviewed materials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein. OPR also\nexamined extensive publicly available information, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and\nother court records, and reviewed media reports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books\nrelating to the Epstein case.\n\nIn addition to this extenstve documentary review, OPR conducted more than 6o interviews\nof witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI administrative personnel;\ncurrent and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former Department atorneys and senior\nmanagers, including a former Deputy Atorney General and a former <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General\nfor the Criminal Division; and the former State Atorney and former <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney in\ncharge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed several victims and atorneys\nrepresenting victims, and reviewed writen submissions from victims, concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and the FBI.\n\nOPR identified former U.S. Atorney Acosta, three former USAO supervisors, and the\nAUSA as subjects of its investigation based on preliminary information indicating that each of\nthem was involved in the decision to resolve the case through the NPA or in the negotiations\nleading to the agreement. OPR deems a current or former Department atorney to be a subject of\nits investigation when the individual’s conduct is within the scope of OPR’s review and may result\nin a finding of professional misconduct. OPR reviewed prior public statements made by Acosta\nand another subject. All five subjects cooperated fully with OPR’s investigation. OPR requested.\nthat all of the subjects provide writen responses detailing their involvement in the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions relating to victim\nnotification and consultation. OPR received and reviewed writen responses from all of the\nsubjects, and subsequently conducted extensive interviews of each subject under oath and before\na court reporter. Each subject was represented by counsel and had access to relevant\ncontemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.* Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency.

As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\na OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nVil\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll83\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021201.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page29 of 258\nSA-27\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27 of 348\nCHAPTER ONE\nSIGNIFICANT ENTITIES AND INDIVIDUALS\nI.

Alexander Acosta was appointed Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally nominated\nAcosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially appointed in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and child sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide supervisory oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8.

In April 2ol7, Acosta became the U.S. Secretary of Labor, but he\nresigned from that post effective July l9, 2ol9, follouing public criticism of the USAO’s handling\nof the Epstein case.\n\nJeffrey H. Sloman joined the USAO in l99o as a line AUSA. In 2ool, he became Deputy\nChief of the USAO’s Fort Lauderdale branch office Narcotics and Violent Crimes Section, and in\n2oo3, became the Managing AUSA for that branch office. In early 2oo4, Sloman was appointed\nChief of the USAO’s Criminal Division. In October 2oo6, Sloman became the FAUSA, and\nSloman’s office was located with Acosta’s in the Miami office’s executive suite.\n\nAs FAUSA, Sloman was responsible for supervising the Civil, Criminal, and Appellate\nDivisions, and he was part of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein investigation.\nAlthough Sloman had relatively litle involvement in the decisions and negotiations that led to the\nNPA and did not review it before it was signed, he personally negotiated an addendum to the NPA,\nwhich he signed on behalf of the USAO in October 2oo7. After subordinates Mathew Menchel\nand Andrew Lourie left the USAO, Sloman directly engaged with the line AUSA, Marie Villafafia,\non Epstein maters, and participated in meetings and other communications with defense counsel.\nAfter Acosta was formally recused from the Epstein mater in December 2oo8, Sloman became\nthe senior USAO official supervising the mater. When Acosta left the USAO, Sloman became\nthe Acting U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida, and in January 2olo, the Atorney\nGeneral appointed Sloman to be the Interim U.S. Atorney for the district. Sloman left the USAO\nto enter private practice in June 2olo.\n\nMathew I. Menchel joined the USAO in l998 after having served as a New York County\n(Manhatan) <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> District Atorney for ll years. After several years as a line AUSA, Menchel\nbecame Chief of the USAO’s Major Crimes Section. In October 2oo6, Menchel became the Chief\nof the USAO’s Criminal Division, based in Miami. As Criminal Division Chief, Menchel was\npart of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein investigation, and he participated in meetings\nand other communications with defense counsel. Menchel participated in the decision to extend a\ntwo-year state-based plea proposal to Epstein and communicated it to the defense. Shortly after\nthat plea offer was extended to Epstein in early August 2oo7, and before the precise terms of the\nNPA were negotiated with defense counsel, Menchel left the USAO to enter private practice.\n\nAndrew C. Lourie joined the USAO as a line AUSA in l994, after having served for three\nyears as an AUSA in New Jersey.

Between those two details, and again after his return to the USAO in July 2oo6, Lourie was\na Deputy Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, serving as the Managing AUSA for the West\nPalm Beach branch office. Lourie was part of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein\ninvestigation and negotiated the NPA, participating in meetings and other communications with\ndefense counsel.

She served\nin the Major Crimes Section in Miami until January 2oo4, when she transferred to the West Palm\nBeach branch office. Villafafia handled the majority of the child exploitation cases in West Palm\nBeach, along with other criminal maters. In 2oo6, she was designated as the USAO’s first\ncoordinator for Project Safe Childhood, a new Department initiative focusing on child sexual\nexploitation and abuse.”\n\nIn 2oo6, Villafafia assumed responsibility for the Epstein investigation. As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.* Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span> to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime.° He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n4 Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media. See, e.g., Landon Thomas\nJr., “Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery,” New York, Oct. 28, 2oo2; Vicky Ward, “The Talented Mr.\nEpstein,” Vanity Fair, Mar. 2oo3; James Barron, “Who Is Jeffrey Epstein?

OVERVIEW\nIn the follouing sections in this chapter, the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR)\n\ndetails the significant events leading to, and during, the federal investigation of Epstein; the\nnegotiation and signing of the NPA; and the defense’s subsequent nine-month effort to stop the\nNPA from taking effect. OPR also describes more briefly the events occurring after Epstein pled\nguilty in state court, as the USAO sought to hold him to the terms of the agreement. In describing\nevents, OPR relies heavily on contemporaneous documents, particularly emails. In many\ninstances, the emails not only describe meetings and identify the participants, but also set forth the\nissues under discussion, the alternatives considered, and the basis for certain decisions. When\nhelpful to explain the actions taken by the subjects, OPR also includes the subjects’ explanations\nas provided in their writen responses to, or interviews with, OPR, or explanations provided by\nwitnesses.\n\nA timeline of key events is set forth on the follouing page.\n\nIl. MARCH 2oo5 — MAY 2oo6: EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM\nBEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE\nATTORNEY’S OFFICE\nA. The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, identified as the recipient of the massage, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\nb As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per massage. The girl claimed that there were nude photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\ninvestigate prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021213.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document O39 3536o38, Page4l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 39 of 348\nand some of the victims as well, regularly recruited local high-school-age girls to give him\nmassages in his home that, in some cases, led to sexual activity.\n\nThrough their interviews with victims, the police learned more about Epstein’s conduct.\nSome girls had only one encounter with Epstein, while others had many encounters with him. The\nnature of the massages varied. According to victims, some girls remained fully clothed while they\nmassaged Epstein, some wore only their underwear, and some were fully nude. Victims stated\nthat during these massages, Epstein masturbated himself. Some victims alleged that he touched\nthem during the massage, usually fondling their breasts or touching their vaginas directly or\nthrough their clothing. Some victims reported that Epstein used a vibrator to masturbate them, and\nsome stated that he digitally penetrated them. Some victims who stated that they saw him more\noften alleged that Epstein engaged in oral and vaginal sex with them. According to one victim, an\nEpstein female <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span> participated, on at least one occasion, in sexual activity with the victim at\nEpstein’s direction.’\n\nAlthough the allegations varied in the specific details, for the most part they were consistent\nin describing a general patern of conduct by Epstein and several of his assistants. According to\nthe information provided to, and evidence gathered by, the PBPD, Epstein’s assistants scheduled\nup to three massage appointments each day, often contacting the girls to make an appointment\nwhile Epstein was en route to Palm Beach from one of his other residences. Typically, when a girl\narrived at Epstein’s home for a massage, she was taken upstairs to the master bedroom and\nbathroom area by one of Epstein’s assistants, who set up a massage table and massage oils. When\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span> left the room, Epstein entered, wearing only a robe or a touel. After removing his\nclothing, Epstein lay face doun and nude on the massage table, instructed the girl to remove her\nclothing, and then explained to her hou he wished her to perform the massage. During the\nmassage, Epstein masturbated himself, often while fondling the girl performing the massage.\nWhen Epstein climaxed, the massage was over. Usually, Epstein paid the girl $2oo for the\nmassage, and if she had not been to his home before, Epstein asked for her phone number to contact\nher in the future. Epstein encouraged the girls who performed these massages to find other girls\ninterested in performing massages for him, and promised that if a girl brought a friend along to\nperform a massage, each girl would receive $2oo. Several of the victims acknouledged to the\nPBPD that they had recruited other girls on Epstein’s behalf.\n\nThe evidence regarding Epstein’s knouledge of the girls’ ages was mixed. Some girls who\nrecruited other girls reportedly instructed the new recruits to tell Epstein, if asked, that they were\nover l8 years old. Houever, some girls informed the PBPD that they told Epstein their real ages.\nPolice were able to corroborate one girl’s report that Epstein sent flouers to her at her high school\nafter she performed ina school play. In addition, an employee of Epstein told the PBPD that some\nof the females who came to Epstein’s residence appeared to be underage.\n\nEpstein was aware of the PBPD investigation almost from the beginning. He retained local\ncriminal defense counsel, who in turn hired private investigators. In October 2oo5, the PBPD,\nwith the assistance of the State Atorney’s Office, obtained a search warrant for Epstein’s\nresidence. When police arrived at Epstein’s home on October 2o, 2oo5, to execute the warrant,\n7 According to the PBPD records, investigators obtained no allegations or evidence that any person other than\nthis female <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span> participated in the sexual activity with the girls.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021214.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N4o 3536o38, Page42 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 4o of 348\n\nthey found computer monitors and keyboards in the home, as well as disconnected surveillance\ncameras, but the computer equipment itself—including video recordings and other electronic\nstorage media—were gone. Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home,\nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a\ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments. The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, “Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”’®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.”\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\na Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n3 In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021215.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONAL 3536o38, Page43 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 4l of 348\n\ntold OPR that Epstein’s local counsel brought atorney Alan Dershouitz to see Krischer and the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney, but Dershouitz was “overly aggressive” and threatened, ““We’re going\nto destroy your witnesses; don’t go to court because we’re going to destroy those girls.” According\nto Krischer, Dershouitz so “tainted the waters” that Epstein also hired local atorney Jack\nGoldberger, with whom Krischer had “a working relationship.” Because the husband of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney was Goldberger’s law partner, Belohlavek recused the <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State\nAtorney to remove “‘even the appearance of any kind of conflict” of interest, and Belohlavek took\nover the case. Goldberger, together with Gerald Lefcourt, a nationally knoun New York criminal\ndefense atorney also representing Epstein, then directed their efforts at Belohlavek and Krischer\nto dissuade the office from prosecuting Epstein, largely by atacking the credibility of the victim\nwitnesses.\n\nMeanwhile, the State Atorney’s Office took the unusual step of preparing to present the\ncase to a grand jury. Krischer told OPR that under state law as it existed until changed in 2ol6,\nhis office prosecuted minors as young as l4 for prostitution.!° The possibility that Epstein’s\nvictims themselves could have been prosecuted caused “great consternation within the office,” and\naccording to Krischer, resulted in the decision to put the case before the grand jury.'! Belohlavek\ntold OPR that her office took the allegations against Epstein “seriously, because .. . it was an\norganized scheme to involve young girls by offering them money. And I wouldn’t say that we...\nthought they were prostitutes .. . [but] I think there was solicitation.” Houever, she said, although\nEpstein’s “behavior was reprehensible, ... I’m limited by . . . the state statutes as to what I can\ncharge.” Krischer told OPR, “There were so many issues involving the victim-witnesses that to\nmy mind, in consultation with my [prosecutors], the only way to achieve, to my mind, real justice\nwas to present the case to the grand jury and not to direct-file” criminal charges against Epstein.\n\nC. Florida State Procedure for Bringing Criminal Charges\n\nFederal criminal procedure requires that a felony charge—that is, any charge punishable\nby imprisonment for one year or more—be brought by a grand jury unless waived by a defendant.\nUnder Florida law, houever, a grand jury is required to bring criminal charges only in a death\npenalty case.'? For all other cases, a State Atorney has concurrent authority to file criminal\ncharges by means of a document called an “information” or to seek a grand jury indictment.\nAlthough Florida criminal cases are routinely charged by information, state grand juries are often\nutilized in sensitive or high-profile cases, such as those involving allegations of wrongdoing by\npublic officials.!* Florida grand jury proceedings are subject to strict secrecy rules that, among\nAo Belohlavek told OPR that prostitution was a misdemeanor charge, and she did not handle misdemeanors.\nu Because the Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigation into the State Atorney’s Office’s\nhandling of the Epstein case was pending at the time OPR interviewed Krischer, he declined to further explain to OPR\nhis office’s prosecutive decisions.\nR U.S. Const. amend.

PBPD Chief Reiter Becomes Concerned with the State Atorney’s Office’s\n\nHandling of the State Investigation and Seeks a Federal Investigation\n\nIn 2oo6, PBPD Chief Reiter perceived that Krischer’s atitude had changed and, according\n\nto Reiter’s statements in his 2oo9 deposition, Krischer said that he did not believe the victims were\ncredible. Reiter was disturbed when Krischer suggested that the PBPD issue a notice for Epstein\nto appear in court on misdemeanor charges, leading Reiter to begin questioning Krischer’s\nobjectivity and the State Atorney’s Office’s approach to the case. As Reiter explained in his\ndeposition:\n\nThis was a case that I felt absolutely needed the atention of the State\n\nAtorney’s Office, that needed to be prosecuted in state court. It’s\n\nnot generally something that’s prosecuted in a federal court. And I\n\nknew that it didn’t really mater what the facts were in this case, it\n\nwas prety clear to me that Mr. Krischer did not want to prosecute\n\nthis case.\n\nOn May l, 2oo6, Reiter submited to Krischer probable cause affidavits and a case filing\npackage relating to Epstein, one of his personal assistants, and a young local woman whom Epstein\nfirst victimized and then used to recruit other girls. In his transmital leter, which was later made\npublic, Reiter criticized Krischer, noting that he found the State Atorney’s Office’s “treatment of\nthese cases [to be] highly unusual.”!° Reiter urged Krischer “to examine the unusual course that\nyour office’s handling of this mater has taken” and to consider disqualifying himself from\nprosecuting Epstein. ‘7\nI. THE FBI AND THE USAO INVESTIGATE EPSTEIN, AND THE DEFENSE\n\nTEAM ENGAGES WITH THE USAO\n\nA. May 2oo6 — February 2oo7: The Federal Investigation Is Initiated, and the\n\nUSAO Opens a Case File\n\nIn early 2oo6, a West Palm Beach FBI Special Agent who worked closely with\nAUSA Ann Marie Villafafia on child exploitation cases—and who is referred to in this Report as\n“the case agent”—mentioned to Villafafia in “casual conversations” having learned that the PBPD\nwas investigating a wealthy Palm Beach man who recruited minors for sexual activity. The case\nagent told Villafafia that the PBPD had reached out to the FBI because the State Atorney’s Office\nwas considering either not charging the case or allouing the defendant to plead to a misdemeanor\nIs Fla. Stat. § 9o5.27 (2oo7).\n\nl6 See Larry Keller, “Palm Beach chief focus of fire in Epstein case,” Palm Beach Post, Aug. l4, 2oo6.\ni As noted, Krischer generally declined in his OPR interview to explain his office’s prosecutive decisions;\nhouever, regarding allegations of favoritism to Epstein’s defense counsel, Krischer told OPR, “I just don’t play that\nway.”\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021217.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ENA 3536o38, Page45 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 43 of 348\ncharge. Villafafia suggested meeting with the PBPD, but the case agent explained that before\nformally presenting the case to the FBI, the PBPD wanted to see hou the State Atorney’s Office\ndecided to charge Epstein.\nl. The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'® At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his background.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the Detective expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.'? The Detective\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose relationship with the <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span>\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\nDetective told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the Detective acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The Detective died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021220.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 4G 3536o38, Page48 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 46 of 348\n4. Late July 2oo6: The State Indicts Epstein, and the USAO Moves\nForward with a Federal Investigation\n\nSeveral days after Villafafia spoke with Acosta and Sloman, on July l9, 2oo6, <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span>\nState Atorney Belohlavek presented the case to the state grand jury.”*> Krischer told OPR that\n“the whole thing” was put before the grand jury. According to a statement made at the time by the\nState Atorney’s Office spokesman, the grand jury was presented with a list of charges from highest\nto louest, without a recommendation by the prosecutor, and deliberated with the prosecutor out of\nthe room.”* The state grand jury returned an indictment charging Epstein with one count of felony\nsolicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7, a felony under state law because\nit alleged three or more instances of solicitation.”° The indictment did not identify the person or\npersons solicited and made no mention of the fact that Epstein had solicited minors.”° On July 23,\n2oo6, Epstein self-surrendered to be arrested on the indictment, but was not detained, and the\ncharges were made public.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she decided to move forward with the federal investigation at that\npoint because she believed the State Atorney’s Office would permit Epstein to enter a plea to a\nreduced misdemeanor charge and that once he entered a guilty plea, the Department’s Petite policy\nmight preclude a federal prosecution.”’ Villafafia told OPR that at the time, she “definitely\nbelieved that we were going to proceed to [a federal] indictment, assuming that ...we had\nsufficient evidence.”\n23 Villafafia and the FBI obtained and examined records of the state grand jury proceeding, and Lourie reviewed\nthem. Because the grand jury records have not been ordered released publicly, OPR does not discuss their substance\nin this Report.\n24 Larry Keller, “Police say lawyer tried to discredit teenage girls,” Palm Beach Post, July 29, 2oo6, citing\nstatement by State Atorney’s Office spokesman Michael Edmondson.\n2 Indictment in State v. Epstein, 2oo6CF9454A XX (July l9, 2oo6), atached as Exhibit l to this Report.\n26 In pertinent part, the state indictment read, “[B]etween the Ist day of August [2oo4] and October 3l, 2oo5,\n[Epstein] did solicit, induce, entice, or procure another to commit prostitution lewdness, or assignation, . . . on three\nor more occasions.” The l5-month time frame and lack of detail regarding the place or manner of the offense made\nit impossible to identify from the charging document which victim or victims served as the basis for the charge in the\nstate indictment. Belohlavek explained to OPR that the charge did not list specific victims so that she could go forward\nat trial with whichever victim or victims might be available and willing to testify at that time.\na The Petite policy is a set of guidelines used by federal prosecutors when considering whether to pursue federal\ncharges for defendants previously prosecuted for state or local offenses. The Constitution does not prohibit the federal\ngovernment from prosecuting defendants who have been charged, acquited, or convicted on state charges based on\nthe same criminal conduct. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing principle that the prohibition\nagainst double jeopardy does not apply to prosecutions brought by different sovereigns. See, e.g., Gamble v. United\nStates, 587 U.S. __, l39 S. Ct. l96o, l966-67 (2ol9) (and cases cited therein); Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S.\nl87, l95 (l959) (and cases cited therein); and United States v. Lanza, 26o U.S. 377, 382 (l922). Nonetheless, to\nbeter promote the efficient use of criminal justice resources, the Department developed policies in l959 and l96o to\nguide federal prosecutors in the use of their charging discretion. See Chapter Two, Part Two, Section II.A.2, for a\nmore detailed discussion of the Petite policy.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l22o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021233.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ae ye ae 3536o38, Page6l of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 59 of 348\nfor meetings was to cause delay, but “the people in my office either couldn’t see that or didn’t\nwant to see that,” perhaps because of “their lack of experience with these types of cases” or a\nmisguided belief “that [Epstein’s] atorneys would not engage in this behavior.” Villafafia told\nOPR that she “could not seem to get [her supervisors] to understand the seriousness of Epstein’s\nbehavior and the fact that he was probably continuing to commit the behavior, and that there was\na need to move with necessary speed.” Nonetheless, Villafafia folloued the guidance of her\nimmediate supervisor and did not send the email.\n\nLike Lourie, Menchel told OPR that he believed meeting with defense counsel was good\npractice. Menchel told OPR that he saw “no dounside” to hearing the defense point of view.\nDefense counsel might make a persuasive point “that’s actually going to change our mind,” or\nalternatively, present arguments the defense would inevitably raise if the case went forward, and\nMenchel believed it would be to the USAO’s advantage to learn about such arguments in advance.\nMenchel also told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia ever articulating a concern that Epstein was\ncontinuing to offend, and in Menchel’s view, Epstein was “already under a microscope, at least in\nFlorida,” and it would have been “the height of stupidity” for Epstein to continue to offend in those\ncircumstances.\n\nE, June 2oo7: Villafafia Supplements the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nWhile Villafafia’s supervisors were considering whether to go forward with the proposed\ncharges, Villafafia took additional steps to support them. On June l4, 2oo7, she supplemented the\nprosecution memorandum with an addendum addressing “credibility concerns” relating to one of\nthe victims. In the email transmiting the addendum to Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her\nimmediate supervisor, Villafafia reported, “another Jane Doe has been identified and interviewed,”\nand the “different strategies” about hou to structure the charges left Villafafia unsure whether “to\nmake... changes nou or wait until we have received approval of the current charging strategy.”\nThe addendum itself related to a particular victim referred to as the minor who “saw Epstein most\nfrequently” and who had allegedly engaged in sexual activity with both Epstein and an Epstein\n<span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span>. In the addendum, Villafafia identified documents she had found corroborating four\nseparate statements made by this victim.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that the only victim about whom any supervisor ever articulated\nspecific credibility issues was the victim discussed in the addendum. Lourie told OPR that he had\nno specific recollection of the addendum, but it was “reasonable” to assume that the addendum\naddressed one particular victim because no one had identified specific concerns relating to any\nother victim. Villafafia’s immediate supervisor similarly told OPR that to her recollection, the\ndiscussions about credibility issues were generic rather than tied to specific victims.\n\nF. The June 26, 2oo7 Meeting with Defense Counsel\n\nMenchel agreed to meet with defense counsel on June 26, 2oo7, communicating directly\nwith Sanchez about the arrangements. At Menchel’s instruction, on June l8, 2oo7, Villafafia sent\na leter to defense counsel identifying what she described as “the statutes under consideration.”*!\nod Villafafia sent copies of this leter to both Menchel and Sanchez.

Menchel surmised that a state resolution accomplished\ntwo things that Acosta viewed as important: first, it resolved any Petite policy concerns, and\nsecond, it afforded more flexibility in sentencing than a federal plea would have alloued. Menchel\ntold OPR that the state plea proposal did not reflect any minimization of Epstein’s conduct and\nthat any state plea would have been to an offense that required sexual offender registration. He\ntold OPR, “I don’t think anybody sat around and said, you knou, it’s not that big a deal. That was\nnot the reaction that I think anybody had from the federal side of this case.” Rather, Menchel said,\n“The concern was if we charge him [as proposed], there’s going to be a trial.”\n2. July 2oo7: Villafaia and Menchel Disagree about the Proposed State\nResolution\nVillafafia told OPR that she was angry when she received Menchel’s July email explaining\nthat he had proposed to Sanchez resolving the federal investigation through a state plea. In\nVillafafia’s view, the proposed state resolution “didn’t make any sense” and “did not correspond”\nto Department policy requiring that a plea offer reflect “the most serious readily provable\noffense.”® In her view, a plea to a state charge “obviously” would not satisfy this policy. Villafafia\nalso told OPR that in her view, the USAM required the USAO to confer with the investigative\nagency about plea negotiations, and Villafafia did not believe the FBI would be in favor of a state\nplea. Villafafia also believed the CVRA required atorneys for the government to confer with\nvictims before making a plea offer, but the victims had not been consulted about this proposal.\nVillafafia told OPR she had met with some of the victims during the course of the investigation\nwho had negative impressions of the State Atorney’s Office, and she believed that “sending them\nback to the State Atorney’s Office was not something” those victims would support.\nbe This policy was set forth in a September 22, 2oo3 memorandum from then Atorney General John Ashcroft\nregarding “Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and Sentencing”\n(knoun as the “Ashcroft Memo”), which provided, in pertinent part:\n[I]n all federal criminal cases, federal prosecutors must charge and pursue the\nmost serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts\nof the case, except as authorized by an <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General, United States\nAtorney, or designated supervisory atorney in the limited circumstances\ndescribed belou. The most serious offense or offenses are those that generate the\nmost substantial sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, unless a mandatory\nminimum sentence or count requiring a consecutive sentence would generate a\nlonger sentence. A charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor has a good\nfaith doubt, for legal or evidentiary reasons, as to the Government’s ability readily\nto prove a charge at trial. Thus, charges should not be filed simply to exert\nleverage to induce a plea. Once filed, the most serious readily provable charges\nmay not be dismissed except to the extent permited [elsewhere in this\nMemorandum].\nSee also Chapter Two, Part Two, Section I.B.l.\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l24o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021242.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 6S 3536o38, Page/o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 68 of 348\n\nMenchel’s reply email began with a rebuke:\nBoth the tone and substance of your email are totally inappropriate\nand, in combination with other maters in the past, it seriously calls\nyour judgment into question.\nAs you well knou, the US Atorney has not even decided whether\nto go forward with a prosecution in this mater, thus you should have\nrespected his position before engaging in plea negotiations.\nAlong that same line, despite whatever contrary representations you\nmade to the agents in this mater, it was made clear to you by the US\nAtorney and the First <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> from the time when you were first\nauthorized to investigate Mr. Epstein that the office had concerns\nabout taking this case because of petit [sic] policy and a number of\nlegal issues.

It\nwas an informal discussion and not in the nature of an official plea\noffer but rather a feeling out by both sides as to what it might take\nto resolve the mater. As you are also well aware, the only reason\nwhy this office even agreed to look into the Epstein mater in the\nfirst instance was because of concerns that the State had not done an\nadequate job in vindicating the victims’ rights. As you and the\nagents conceded, had Epstein been convicted of a felony that\nresulted in a jail sentence and sex offender status, neither the FBI\nnor our office ever would have interceded.

She disagreed, houever, with his representation about her initial meeting with Acosta\nand Sloman regarding the Epstein investigation, noting that Menchel had not been at that\nmeeting.® Villafafia told OPR that no one had communicated to her the “concerns” Menchel\nmentioned, and she had not been given an opportunity to respond to those concerns.”\n\nA week later, Villafafia replied to Menchel’s email, reiterating her concerns about the\nprocess and that filing charges against Epstein was not moving forward:\n\nHi Mat -- My trial is over, so I nou have [ ] time to focus back on\n\nthis case and our e-mail exchange. There are several points in your\nSF Neither Menchel nor Villafafia could recall for OPR to what concerns they were referring. In commenting\non OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney noted that Acosta’s concerns were “the possibility that bringing a case with\nserious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal issues could result in an outcome that set back the development of\ntrafficking laws and result in an aggregate greater harm to trafficking victims.”\n68 Menchel confirmed to OPR that he was not involved in the decision to initiate the federal investigation.\n69 Villafafia characterized Menchel’s email as “meant to intimidate” and told OPR that she felt “put in [her]\nplace” by him. She perceived that Menchel was making it clear that she should not “jump the chain of command.”\nMenchel, houever, asserted to OPR that Villafafia had a “history of resisting supervisory authority” that warranted\nhis strong response.\n\n43\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l243\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021245.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page73 of 258\nSA-7l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 7l of 348\n\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt of Epstein’s criminal culpability.\nLastly, I was not trying to “dictate” a meeting with the U.S. Atorney\nor anyone else.

She viewed Menchel’s\nmessage as a rejection of her request to make a presentation to Acosta, and she told OPR that even\nthough she regarded Sloman as a friend, she did not feel she could reach out even to him to raise\nher concerns.’! Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not “order” Villafafia to refrain from\nraising her concerns with Acosta, Sloman, or Lourie, and he did not believe his email to Villafafia\nforeclosed her from meeting with Acosta. Rather, “the context of this exchange is, she is running\nroughshod over the U.S. Atorney, and what I am saying to her is, there is a process. You’re not\nin charge of it. I’m not in charge of it. [Acosta’s] in charge of it.” Acosta, who was apparently\nnot aware of Villafafia’s email exchange with Menchel, told OPR that from his perspective,\nVillafafia was not “frozen out” of the case and that he would have met with her had she asked him\ndirectly for a meeting.\n\nB. Villafaia Atempts to Obtain the Computer Equipment Missing from\n\nEpstein’s Palm Beach Home, but the Defense Team Opposes Her Efforts\n\nAs the USAO managers considered in July 2oo7 hou to resolve the federal investigation,\none item of evidence they did not have available to assist in that decision was the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s home before the PBPD executed its search warrant. Although\nVillafafia took steps to obtain the evidence, defense counsel continued to oppose her efforts.\nas Menchel forwarded this email to Sloman.\n\n7l Villafafia told OPR that she later spoke to Menchel, asking Menchel to redirect Sanchez to Villafafia, but that\nMenchel responded it was not Villafafia’s “place” to tell him to whom he should direct communications.\n45\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l245\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021246.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye, ae 3536o38, Page/4 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 72 of 348\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.’”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based.\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n@ In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span>, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

Acosta Decides on a Resolution That Includes a Two-Year Term of\nIncarceration\n\nThe next critical step in the development of the NPA was the decision to propose a two-\nyear term of imprisonment. Although presented to the defense as the “minimum” the USAO would\naccept, in actuality the two-year proposal became only the starting point for the negotiations, with\nthe result that the defense continued to chip away at it as the negotiations continued. The\ncontemporaneous emails make no mention of any rationale for the decision to propose two years\nas the government’s beginning negotiating position, and nobody with whom OPR spoke was able\nto recall hou the decision was made. As discussed belou, Acosta did offer OPR an explanation,\nbut OPR was unable to find contemporaneous evidence supporting it.’°\n\nWhile the defense was communicating its objections to the federal investigation to\nVillafafia, Lourie, Menchel, and Sloman, Villafafia continued moving touard filing charges. On\nJuly l9, 2oo7, the day after receiving Oosterban’s email supporting a potential prosecution,\nVillafafia emailed Lourie and Menchel seeking approval to take further investigative steps\nregarding three of Epstein’s assistants. Houever, Menchel directed Villafafia to “hold off... until\nwe decide what course of action we are going to take on [E]pstein which should happen next\nweek.” Menchel told OPR that he did not specifically recall why he asked Villafafia to wait, but\nhe assumed it was because Acosta was deciding what course of action to take on the case.\n\nOn Monday, July 23, 2oo7, Menchel submited a resignation notice to Acosta, stating that\nhe would be leaving the USAO effective August 6, 2oo7.77\n\nl. The July 26, 2oo7 Meeting in Miami\n\nEarly on the morning of Thursday, July 26, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Menchel that she was\npreparing a new draft indictment containing revisions he had suggested, including removal of all\nbut three of the “travel counts” and “a large number of [the] overt acts,” and the addition of overt\nacts and counts relating to two additional victims; she would not, houever, have the revised\nindictment ready in time “for our discussion today” at their 2:oo p.m. meeting. Menchel told OPR\nthat the fact that he had both proposed revisions to the indictment and also directed Villafafia to\ndelay the investigative steps involving the assistants indicated that he was “trying to do something”\nwith the case, but was waiting for Acosta to decide the “underlying issue” of whether to proceed\nwith federal charges.\n\nAcosta made that decision on or before July 26, 2oo7. On that afternoon, Villafafia met in\nMiami with Menchel. She told OPR that Sloman, as well as the FBI case agents and their\nsupervisors, were also present, with Lourie participating by telephone. Villafafia told OPR that\nshe expected that the meeting, requested by Menchel, would address the direction of the\ninvestigation. Houever, Villafafia told OPR that after everyone had assembled, Menchel entered\nthe room and stated that Acosta “has decided to offer a two-year state deal.” According to\nis See Section IV.D.2 in this Part.\n77 As early as May 4, 2oo7, Menchel had informed Acosta that he was intending to leave the USAO to enter\nprivate practice.\n\n48\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l248\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021258.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N84 3536o38, Page86 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 84 of 348\nLILLY ANN SANCHEZ, Esq.\nAUGUST 3, 2oo7\nPAGE 2\nPlease let us knou your client's decision by no later than August l7, [have conferred\nwith U.S, Atorney Acosta who has asked me to communicate that the two-year term of\nincarceration is a non-negotiable minimum to vindicate a federal interest, and, at this time,\nhe is not inclined to meet with counsel for Mr. Epstein.\nSincerely,\nR.

Marie Villafafia\n\nMenchel told OPR that in his view, the two-year sentence established a “floor” for\nnegotiations and if Epstein rejected the offer, subsequent offers would require him to accept more\njail time rather than less. Menchel told OPR that the USAO was “leaving our options open” by\nretaining the option of a federal plea because he thought the defense was “trying ... to get him\ninto a federal penitentiary.” The leter’s deadline of August l7, 2oo7, for acceptance of the\ngovernment’s offer was intended to accommodate Villafafia’s request that the deadline provide\nher with enough time to go to New York, pursue investigative steps involving two of Epstein’s\nassistants, do witness interviews, and take additional legal steps to obtain Epstein’s computers if\nEpstein rejected the deal. Menchel told OPR he considered August l7 to be a firm deadline: “[I]f\nyou tell someone they have two weeks, it should be two weeks.” Menchel signed and sent the\nleter on Friday, August 3, 2oo7, which was his last day at the USAO before joining a private law\nfirm.”\n\nThe follouing Monday, August 6, 2oo7, Villafafia contacted Menchel by email at his new\nfirm to inquire whether the leter to Epstein’s counsel had gone out on Friday.

Leading to the Meeting with Defense Counsel, Investigative Steps Are\nPostponed, and the Defense Continues to Oppose Villafaia’s Efforts to\nObtain the Computer Evidence\n\nOn August 8, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Acosta that she had spoken with Oosterban, who\nwas willing to join a meeting with the defense; although he could not do so in person until after\nAugust 2l, he was willing to participate by phone in order “to stay firm on our August l7th\ndeadline.” Villafafia also reiterated that she wanted to contact Epstein’s assistants in New York\nand to interview some of Epstein’s colleagues and former employees there. Noting that “there was\nsome concern about [taking the proposed investigative steps] while we are trying to negotiate a\nplea,” Villafafia asked Acosta for guidance. Lourie also emailed Acosta and Sloman, asking that\nthe USAO “stick to our deadline if possible.” Lourie pointed out that CEOS “has no approval\nauthority” and opined it was “a bit extreme to allou the defense to keep arguing this [case] to\ndifferent agencies.” Acosta replied, “This will end up [at the Department] anyhou, if we don’t\nmeet with them. I’d rather keep it here. Brin[g]ing [the Chief of CEOS] in visibly does so. If our\ndeadline has to slip a bit . . . it’s worth it.”\n\nAs aresult, the investigative steps were postponed. On August lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLourie inquiring whether she could “still go ahead” with the New York trip and whether she could\noppose Black’s request to stay the litigation concerning the government’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s computer equipment until after Acosta’s meeting with the defense team. Villafafia was\nreluctant to delay the litigation and reported to Lourie that agents recently had interviewed a girl\nwho began seeing Epstein at age l4 and who was photographed in the nude by an Epstein <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span>.\nOn August l3, 2oo7, Villafafia advised Black that the USAO was not willing to agree to a stay of\nthe litigation. Houever, Sanchez reached out to Lourie on August 22, 2oo7, and obtained his\nagreement to a joint request for a stay until the week after Acosta’s meeting with defense counsel,\nwhich was scheduled for September 7, 2oo7.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, in her opinion, the defense efforts to put off the litigation\nconcerning the computers was “further evidence of the importance of [this] evidence.””’ Villafafia\nsuspected the computers contained evidence that “would have put this case completely to bed.”\na In context, Acosta appeared to mean that although he was not concerned about the Department reviewing the\nNPA or its terms, he did have concerns that the Department would decide the USAO should not have accepted the\ncase because of a lack of federal interest and might direct the USAO to end its involvement in the mater.\n\na Menchel told OPR, on the other hand, “there could be a lot of reasons why” defense counsel would resist\n“turn[ing] over an entire computer.”\n6o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l26o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021262.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document O88 3536o38, Page9o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 88 of 348\nVillafafia added that the PBPD Chief had alerted the FBI that an upcoming news article would\nreport that Epstein was “going to plead to a state charge” and the PBPD Chief “wanted to knou if\nthe victims had been consulted about the deal.” Sloman forwarded Villafafia’s email to Acosta\nwith a note that read simply, “fyi.”\n\nLater that evening, Villafafia circulated to Sloman, Lourie, and Oosterban two alternative\ndocuments: a draft federal plea agreement and a draft NPA.'” The draft federal plea agreement,\nfollouing the USAO’s standard format, called for Epstein to plead guilty to a five-year conspiracy\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 37l to entice minors to engage in prostitution, an offense requiring registration\nas a sexual offender, with a Rule ll(c) binding sentence of two years’ imprisonment. The draft\nNPA contained the terms presented to the defense team on July 3l, 2oo7, and called for Epstein to\nenter a state plea by September 28, 2oo7. Villafafia told OPR that because she had never seen a\nnon-prosecution agreement before, she relied on a template she found either using USAO or the\nDepartment’s internal online resources, but she did not do any additional research regarding the\nuse of non-prosecution agreements. !°!\n\n3. September 7, 2oo7: Acosta, Other USAO Atorneys, and FBI\nSupervisors Meet with Epstein Atorneys Starr, Lefkouitz, and\nSanchez\n\nOn Friday, September 7, 2oo7, Acosta, Sloman, Villafafia, Villafafia’s co-counsel,\nOosterban, and one or two supervisory FBI agents met at the USAO’s West Palm Beach office\nwith defense atorneys Sanchez and, for the first time, Starr and Lefkouitz.°? This was Acosta’s\nfirst meeting with Epstein’s defense team. Villafafia understood the purpose of this meeting was\nto afford Epstein’s counsel an opportunity to “make a pitch” as to why the case should not be\nprosecuted federally. Villafafia recalled that at a “pre-meet” before defense counsel arrived,\nAcosta did not express concern about the viability of the prosecution or the strength of the case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that the meeting was not “a negotiation,” but a chance for the defense to\npresent their arguments, which were made by Starr and focused primarily on federalism. Villafafia\nsimilarly recalled that the meeting mainly consisted of the defense argument that the Epstein case\nshould remain a state mater in which the USAO should not interfere. Both Villafafia and her\nco-counsel recalled that Starr addressed himself directly to Acosta, and that Starr, who had held\nSenate-confirmed positions in the government, commented to Acosta that he and Acosta were “the\nonly people in this room who have run the [gantlet] of confirmation by the Senate.” Acosta did\nnot recall the comment, but he told OPR, “[B]ack in July, we had decided that we were going\nChapter Three, the Department’s position at the time was that victim consultation was not required in maters in which\nthe government did not pursue a federal charge. The USAO’s actions with respect to victim consultation and the\nDepartment’s interpretation of the CVRA are discussed in detail in Chapter Three of this Report.\n\nloo The initial draft NPA is atached as Exhibit 2 to this Report.\nA OPR was unable to identify a template upon which she might have relied.\nlo2 Lourie was not present. During September 2oo7, he was traveling between Florida and Washington, D.C.,\nas he transitioned to his new detail post as Principal Deputy <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General and Chief of Staff to the head\nof the Department’s Criminal Division, <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General Alice Fisher. He served in that detail until he left\nthe Department in February 2oo8.\n\n62\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l262\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021263.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 89 3536o38, Page9l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 89 of 348\nforward, that either there is this pre-indictment resolution, or we go forward with an indictment.\nThe September meeting did not alter or shift our position.”!%\n\nVillafafia told OPR that after hearing the defense argument, Acosta reiterated that the\nfederal interest in the case could be vindicated only by a state plea to an offense that required\nsexual offender registration, resulted in a two-year term of incarceration, and was subject to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 process for providing compensation to the victims. When defense counsel\nobjected to the registration requirement, Acosta held firm, and he also rejected the defense proposal\nfor a sentence of home confinement. In a subsequent email exchange with Criminal Division\nDeputy <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General Sigal Mandelker, who supervised CEOS, Oosterban reported\nthat the meeting was “non-eventful,” noting that defense counsel argued “federalism” and might\napproach Criminal Division <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General Alice Fisher to present that argument\ndirectly to her.\n\nVI. SEPTEMBER 2oo7: THE PLEA NEGOTIATIONS INTENSIFY, AND IN THE\n\nPROCESS, THE REQUIRED TERM OF IMPRISONMENT IS REDUCED\n\nAcosta had dispensed with the August l7, 2oo7 plea deadline specified in Menchel’s\nAugust 3, 2oo7 leter, in order to allou the defense to meet with him. After that meeting, and\nalthough Villafafia continued to plan to file charges on September 25, no new plea deadline was\nestablished, and the negotiations continued through most of September.\n\nThe defense used that time to push the USAO to make concessions. Because Acosta was\nnot willing to compromise on the issue of sexual offender registration or providing a means\nthrough which the victims could seek monetary damages, the negotiations focused on the term of\nimprisonment. As the contemporaneous emails shou, the USAO did not hold to its position that\na two-year term of imprisonment was “the minimum” that the USAO would accept. To reach an\nagreement with the defense on Epstein’s sentence, the USAO explored possible pleas in either\nfederal or state court, or both, and Villafafia spent considerable time and effort working with\ndefense counsel on developing alternative pleas with various outcomes. In the course of that\nprocess, the agreement was revised to require that Epstein accept a sentence of l8 months, with\nthe understanding that under the state’s sentencing procedures, he would likely serve just l5\nmonths.\n\nA. The Incarceration Term Is Reduced from 24 Months to 2o Months\n\nShortly after the September 7, 2oo7 meeting, Epstein atorney Gerald Lefcourt, who had\nnot been present at the meeting, spoke with both Acosta and Lourie, and made a new counteroffer,\nproposing that Epstein serve l5 months in jail folloued by l5 months in home confinement. On\nthe afternoon of Monday, September lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, identifying issues she\nwanted to discuss with him, including her concern that defense counsel was pushing for a\nresolution that would allou Epstein to avoid incarceration and possibly sexual offender\nregistration. Villafafia stated that Lefcourt’s counteroffer was “a reasonable counteroffer in light\nof our starting position of 24 months,” but added that it was “a really lou sentence.” Villafafia\nlo3 Sloman echoed this point, telling OPR that Starr’s presentation focused on the issue of federalism, but the\nUSAO had already decided to defer prosecution to the state and after the meeting, the USAO continued on that path.\n\n63\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l263\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021264.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document Eoo 3536o38, Page92 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 9o of 348\nnoted that the revised charges involved l9 victims, so the defense proposal for a l5-month sentence\namounted to less than one month per victim. Villafafia requested that “whatever the U.S. Atorney\ndecides to do,” the agreement with Epstein should “follou ... a version of my writen non-\nprosecution agreement” in order to “avoid any state shenanigans and .. . keep the defense on a\nstrict timeline.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia circulated to Acosta and Sloman a revised NPA that called for a\n2o-month jail sentence to be folloued by lo months of home confinement. This redrafted NPA\ncontained a provision that specified, “With credit for gain time, Epstein shall serve at least\nl7 months in a state correctional institution.”'°* Acosta reviewed the revised NPA and amended\nit to include a statement clarifying that it was Epstein’s obligation “to undertake discussions with\nthe State of Florida to ensure compliance with these procedures.” Villafafia sent her version of the\nrevised NPA to Lefcourt that afternoon and forwarded Acosta’s proposed change to him the\nfollouing day, after she learned of it.\n\nOn September ll, 2oo7, the court contacted Villafafia to inquire whether the USAO would\nbe prepared to proceed with the litigation concerning the computers the follouing day. At\nSloman’s direction, Villafafia asked the court to delay the hearing, and the court rescheduled it for\nthe follouing week. At the same time, anticipating that plea negotiations would fail, Villafafia\ncirculated a revised indictment to her co-counsel and Oosterban, seeking their feedback before\nsending it “through the chain of command.” Villafafia also sent Oosterban the revised NPA and\ntold him she was “still shooting for 9/25” to bring charges, assuming the defense declined the\nUSAO’s offer. Oosterban responded, “The counter-offering is unfortunate, but I suppose it’s\nunderstandable.” !°°\n\nThat afternoon, Lourie asked Villafafia, “What is our latest offer?” Villafafia responded,\n“Plead to the three specified [state] charges, a 3o-month sentence, split 2o in jail and lo in\n‘community control,’ and agree that the girls are victims for purposes of damages. We also put in\ndeadlines for a plea and sentencing date.”\n\nB. September l2, 2oo7: The USAO and Defense Counsel Meet with the State\n\nAtorney\n\nAlthough the USAO and defense counsel had been discussing resolving the federal\ninvestigation with a plea to state charges, there is no evidence that the USAO involved the State\nAtorney’s Office in those discussions until September l2, 2oo7. On that day, Lourie, Villafafia,\nand another USAO supervisor who would be replacing Lourie as manager of the USAO’s West\nPalm Beach office, and Epstein atorneys Lefkouitz, Lefcourt, and Goldberger met with State\nAtorney Barry Krischer and <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek. Other than Villafafia,\nfew of the participants had any memory of the meeting or the results of it. The available evidence\nindicates that the USAO made additional concessions during the meeting.\n\nlo Through “gain time,” Florida inmates can earn a reduction in their sentence for good behavior.\nlo5 Oosterban told OPR that he did not recall having read the NPA at this juncture and “had no involvement\nwith it.”\n64\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l264\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021268.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OO eNO4 3536o38, Page96 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 94 of 348\nD. The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: harassment to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month recommendation, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding recommendation that he be sentenced to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of community control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be appointed\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”!!! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\ni The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l268\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021269.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document NOS 3536o38, Page97 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 95 of 348\nto the assault charge” and suggesting a different factual scenario to support a federal charge.'!” At\nthis point, Sloman left on vacation, and he informed Acosta and Villafafia that in his absence\nLourie had agreed “to help finalize this.” Lourie spent the follouing work week at his new post\nat the Department in Washington, D.C., but communicated with his USAO colleagues by phone\nand email.\n\nIn a Sunday, September l6, 2oo7 email, Villafafia informed Lefkouitz that she had drafted\na factual proffer to accompany a revised “hybrid” federal plea proposal. In that email, Villafafia\nalso noted that she was considering filing charges in the federal district court in Miami, “which\nwill hopefully cut the press coverage significantly.” This email received considerable atention l2\nyears later when it was made public during the CVRA litigation and was viewed as evidence of\nthe USAO’s efforts to conceal the NPA from the victims. Villafafia, houever, explained to OPR\nthat she was concerned that news media coverage would violate the victims’ privacy. She told\nOPR, “[I]f [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into\nthe courthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper,” and that such publicity\nwas less likely to happen in Miami, where the press “in general does not care about what happens\nin Palm Beach.”\n\nLefkouitz responded to Villafafia with a revised version of her latest proposed “hybrid”\nplea agreement, in a document entitled “Agreement.” Significantly, this defense proposal\nintroduced two new provisions. The first related to four female assistants who had allegedly\nfacilitated Epstein in his criminal scheme. The defense sought a government promise not to\nprosecute them, as well as certain other unnamed Epstein employees, and a promise to forego\nimmigration proceedings against two of the female assistants:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also\n\nprecludes the initiation of any and all criminal charges which might\n\notherwise in the future be brought against [four named female\n\nassistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate\n\nentity] for any criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal\n\ninvestigation . . . . Further, no immigration proceeding will be\n\ninstituted against [two named female assistants] as a result of the\n\nongoing investigation.\n\nThe second new provision related to the USAO’s efforts to obtain Epstein’s computers:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement\n\nresolves any and all outstanding [legal process] that have requested\n\nwitness testimony and/or the production of documents and/or\n\ncomputers in relation to the investigation that is the subject of the\n\nAgreement. Each [legal process] will be withdrawn upon the\n\nexecution of the Agreement and will not be re-issued absent reliable\n2 Villafafia told OPR that she sometimes used her home email account because “[nJegotiations were occurring\nat nights, on weekend|[s], and while I was [away from the office for personal reasons], . . . and this occurred during a\ntime when out of office access to email was very limited.” Records shou her supervisors were aware that at times she\nused her personal email account in communicating with defense counsel in this case.\n\n69\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l269\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021270.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document E96 3536o38, Page98 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 96 of 348\nevidence of a violation of the agreement. Epstein and his counsel\nagree that the computers that are currently under [legal process] will\nbe safeguarded in their current condition by Epstein’s counsel or\ntheir agents until the terms and conditions of the Agreement are\n\nfulfilled.\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a lengthy email to convey two options Lourie had\nsuggested: “the original proposal” for a state plea but with an agreement for an l8-month sentence,\nor pleas to state charges and two federal obstruction-of-justice charges. Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year conspiracy\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding recommendation for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\nsentenced in the state after he is sentenced in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be sentenced after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the resolution of all criminal liability, “and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she understood\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed.\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.'l3\n\nWith regard to immigration, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on immigration issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in connection with\ntheir immigration paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status. So there wasn’t any reason\nl3 OPR understood Villafafia’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry\ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to\ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l27o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021273.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, SA.99 3536o38, Pagelol of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 99 of 348\ntwelve months, with six served in home confinement, to run\nconsecutively.\nI just received an e-mail asking if Mr. Epstein could just do l2\nmonths imprisonment instead.\nAs you can see, Mr. Epstein is having second thoughts about doing\njail time.

When [Epstein] gets out, he has to plead to state\noffenses, including against minor, registrable, and then take one year house arrest/community\nconfinement.” By reply email, Villafafia asked Lourie to call her, but there is no record of whether\nthey spoke.\n\nF. Defense Counsel Offers New Proposals Substantially Changing the Terms of\n\nthe Federal Plea Agreement, which the USAO Rejects\n\nApproximately an hour after Lourie’s email reporting the deal he had reached with\nLefkouitz, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a revised draft plea agreement. Despite the agreement Lourie\nbelieved he and Lefkouitz had reached that morning, Lefkouitz’s proposal would have resulted\nin a l6-month federal sentence folloued by 8 months of supervised release served in the form of\nhome detention. Lefkouitz also inserted a statement in his proposal explicitly prohibiting the\nUSAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration authorities to institute immigration\nproceedings against two of Epstein’s female assistants.\n\nVillafafia circulated the defense’s proposed plea agreement to Lourie and two other\nsupervisors, and expressed frustration that the new defense version incorporated terms that were\n“completely different from what Jay just told Andy they would agree to.” Villafafia also pointed\nout that the defense “wants us to recommend an improper calculation” of the sentencing guidelines\nll8 The manager told OPR that he probably meant this as a joke because in his view the continued back-and-\nforth communications with defense counsel “was ridiculous,” and the only way to “get this deal done” might be to\nhave a direct conversation with Epstein.\n\n73\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l273\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021275.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONO 3536o38, Pagelo3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lol of 348\nmessage, “That is fine. [The West Palm Beach manager] and I will nail everything doun, we just\nwant to get a final blessing.”\n\nNegotiations continued throughout the day on Wednesday, September l9, 2oo7, with\nVillafafia and Lefkouitz exchanging emails regarding the factual proffer for a plea and the\nscheduling of a meeting to finalize the plea agreement’s terms. During that exchange, Villafafia\nmade clear to Lefkouitz that the time for negotiating was reaching an end:\n\nI hate to have to be firm about this, but we need to wrap this up by\nMonday. I will not miss my [September 25 charging] date when this\nhas dragged on for several weeks already and then, if things fall\napart, be left in a less advantageous position than before the\nnegotiations. I have had an 82-page pros memo and 53-page\nindictment siting on the shelf since May to engage in these\nnegotiations. There has to be an ending date, and that date is\nMonday.\n\nEarly that afternoon, Lourie—who was participating in the week’s negotiations from his\nnew post at the Department in Washington, D.C.—asked Villafafia to furnish him with the last\ndraft of the plea agreement she had sent to defense counsel, and she provided him with the “l8/l2\nsplit” draft she had sent to Lefkouitz the prior afternoon. After reviewing that draft, Lourie told\nVillafafia it was a “[glood job” but he questioned certain provisions, including whether the\nUSAO’s agreement to suspend the investigation and hold all legal process in abeyance should be\nin the plea agreement. Villafafia told Lourie that she had added that paragraph at the “insistence”\nof the defense, and opined, “I don’t think it hurts us.” Villafafia explained to OPR that she held\nthis view because “Alex and people above me had already made the decision that if the case was\nresolved we weren’t going to get the computer equipment.”\n\nAt 3:44 p.m. that afternoon, Lefkouitz emailed a “redline” version of the federal plea\nagreement shouing his new revisions, and noted that he was “also working on a deferred [sic]\nprosecution agreement because it may well be that we cannot reach agreement here.” The defense\nredline version required Epstein to plead guilty to a federal information charging two misdemeanor\ncounts of atempt to intentionally harass a person to prevent testimony, the pending state\nindictment charging solicitation of prostitution, and a state information charging one count of\ncoercing a person to become a prostitute, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o4 (without regard\nto age). Neither of the proposed state offenses required sexual offender registration. Epstein\nwould serve an l8-month sentence and a concurrent 6o months on probation on the state charges.\nThe redline version again deleted the provisions relating to damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and\nreplaced it with the provision requiring creation of a trust administered by the state court. It\nretained language proposed by Villafafia, providing that the plea agreement “resolves the federal\ncriminal liability of the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida\ngrouing out of any criminal conduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this\nplea agreement,” but also re-inserted the provision promising not to prosecute Epstein’s assistants\nand the statement prohibiting the USAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration\nproceedings.

Acosta Edits the Federal Plea Agreement, and Villafaia Sends a Final Version\n\nto the Defense\n\nThe next day, Thursday, September 2o, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney\nBelohlavek and informed her:\n\nOur deadline is Monday evening for a signed agreement and\narraignment in the federal system. At this time, things don’t look\npromising anyway, but I will keep you posted. In their latest draft,\nthey changed what they agreed to plead to in the state from\nsolicitation of minors for prostitution (a registrable offense) to\nforcing adults into prostitution (a non-registrable offense). We will\nnot budge on this issue, so it is looking unlikely that we will reach a\nmutually acceptable agreement. If that changes, I will let you knou.\n\nAcosta sent Lourie “[s]ome thoughts” about the USAO version of the proposed “hybrid”\nfederal plea agreement he had received from Lourie the evening before, commenting that “it seems\nvery straightforward” and “we are not changing our standard charging language” for the\ndefense. '”° Noting that the draft was prepared for his signature, Acosta told Lourie that he did not\ntypically sign plea agreements and “this should not be the first,” adding that the USAO “should\nonly go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement.” ”! Lourie forwarded the email\nto Villafafia with a transmital message simply reading, “I think Alex’s changes are all good ones.\nPlease try to incorporate his suggestions, change the signature block to your name and send as\nfinal to Jay.” Lourie also noted to Acosta and Villafafia that he believed the defense would want\nto go back to the initial offer of a state plea with a non-prosecution agreement. When Villafafia\nsent the revised plea agreement to Lefkouitz later that afternoon, she advised him that if the\ndefense wanted to return to the original offer of a state plea only, the draft NPA she had sent to\nhim on September l7, 2oo7, would control.\n\nl2o The USAO had standard federal plea agreement language, from which this “hybrid” plea agreement had\nsubstantially diverged.\n\nVt The standard procedure was for documents such as plea agreements to be signed by an AUSA under the\nname of the U.S. Atorney. In his OPR interview, Acosta further explained that wanted to give “the trial team” an\nopportunity to voice any objections because “if it’s something they don’t feel comfortable with we... shouldn’t go\nforward with it.”\n\n77\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l277\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021279.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONS 3536o38, Pagelo7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo5 of 348\nI think Jay [Lefkouitz] will try to talk you out of a registrable\noffense.

For that\nreason alone, I don’t think we should consider allouing them to\ncome doun from their oun offer, either on this issue or on time of\n\nincarceration.\n\nLefkouitz atempted to reach Acosta that night, but Acosta directed Villafafia to return the\ncall, and told Lourie that he did not want to open “a backchannel” with defense counsel. Lourie\ninstructed Villafafia, “U can tell [JJay that [A]lex will not agree to a nonregistration offense.”\n\nOn the morning of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Acosta informing him\nthat “it looks like we will be [filing charges against] Mr. Epstein on Tuesday,” reporting that the\ncharging package was being reviewed by the West Palm Beach manager, and asking if anyone in\nthe Miami office needed to review it. Villafafia also alerted Lourie that she had spoken that\nmorning to Lefkouitz, who “was waffling” about Epstein pleading to a state charge that required\nsexual offender registration, and she noted that she would confer with Krischer and Belohlavek\n“to make sure the defense doesn’t try to do an end run.”\n\nThat same morning, Epstein atorney Sanchez, who had not been involved in negotiations\nfor several weeks, emailed Sloman, advising, “[I] want to finalize the plea deal and there is only\none issue outstanding and [I] do not believe that [A]lex has read all the defense submissions that\nwould assist in his determination on this point .. .

Don’t even engage with yet another cook.”\n\nJ. The USAO Agrees Not to Criminally Charge “Potential Co-Conspirators”\n\nLefkouitz, in the meantime, sent Villafafia a revised draft NPA that proposed an l8-month\nsentence in the county jail, folloued by l2 months of community control, and restored the\nprovision for a trust fund for disbursement to an agreed-upon list of individuals “who seek\nreimbursement by filing suit pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 2255.” This defense draft retained the\nprovision promising not to criminally charge Epstein’s four female assistants and unnamed\nemployees of the specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity, but also extended the provision to “any\npotential co-conspirators” for any criminal charge arising from the ongoing federal investigation.\nThis language had evolved from similar language that Villafafia had included in the USAO’s\nearlier proposed draft federal plea agreement.'?” Lefkouitz also again included the sentence\nl22 The language in the USAO’s draft federal plea agreement stated, “This agreement resolves the federal\ncriminal liability of the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any\ncriminal conduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO]....”\n\n79\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l279\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021280.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lo6 3536o38, Pagelo8 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo6 of 348\nprecluding the government from requesting, initiating, or recommending immigration proceedings\nagainst the two assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAt this point, Lefkouitz again sought to speak to Acosta, who replied by email: “I am\nhappy to talk. My caveat is that in the middle of negotiations, u try to avoid[] undermining my\nstaff by allouing ‘interlocutor[]y’ appeals so to speak so ’d want [M]arie on the call[.] [Pll have\nher set something up.”\n\nVillafafia sent to Lefkouitz her oun revised NPA, telling him it was her “atempt at\ncombining our thoughts,” but it had not “been approved by the office yet.” She inserted solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, a registrable offense, as the charge to which Epstein would\nplead guilty; proposed a joint recommendation for a 3o-month sentence, divided into l8 months\nin the county jail and l2 months of community control; and amended the § 2255 provision.’\nVillafafia’s revision retained the provision suspending the investigation and holding all legal\nprocess in abeyance, and she incorporated the non-prosecution provision while slightly altering it\nto apply to “any potential co-conspirator of Epstein, including” the four named assistants, and\ndeleting mention of the corporate entity employees. Finally, Villafafia deleted mention of\nimmigration proceedings, but advised in her transmital email that “we have not and don’t plan to\nask immigration” proceedings to be initiated. l”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia alerted Lourie (who had arrived in Florida from Washington, D.C.\nearly that afternoon) and the new West Palm Beach manager (copying her first-line supervisor and\nco-counsel) that she had included language that defense counsel had requested “regarding\npromises not to prosecute other people,” and commented, “I don’t think it hurts us.” There is no\ndocumentation that Lourie, the West Palm Beach manager, or anyone else expressed disagreement\nwith Villafafia’s assessment. Rather, within a few minutes, Villafafia re-sent her email, adding\nthat defense counsel was persisting in including an immigration waiver in the agreement, to which\nLourie responded, “No way. We don’t put that sort of thing in aplea agreement.” Villafafia replied\nto Lourie, indicating she would pass that along to defense counsel and adding, “Any other\nthoughts?” When Lourie gave no further response, Villafafia informed defense counsel that Lourie\nhad rejected the proposed immigration language.\n\nOPR questioned the subjects about the USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Lourie did not recall why the USAO agreed to it, but he speculated that he left\nthat provision in the NPA because he believed at the time that it benefited the government in some\nway. In particular, Lourie conjectured that the promise not to prosecute “any potential\nco-conspirators” protected victims who had recruited others and thus potentially were\nco-conspirators in Epstein’s scheme. Lourie also told OPR, “I bet the answer was that we weren’t\ngoing to charge” Epstein’s accomplices, because Acosta “didn’t really want to charge Epstein” in\nl3 Villafafia noted that she had consulted with a USAO employee who was a “former corporate counsel from a\nhospital” about the § 2255 language, and thought that the revised language “addresses the concern about having an\nunlimited number of claimed victims, without me trying to bind girls who I do not represent.”\n\na Villafafia gave OPR an explanation similar to that given by the case agents—that an ICE Special Agent had\nbeen involved in the early stages of the federal investigation of Epstein, and Villafafia believed the agent knew two of\nEpstein’s female assistants were foreign nationals and would have acted appropriately on that information. Villafafia\nalso said that the USAO generally did not get involved in immigration issues.\n8o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l28o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021286.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OND 3536o38, Pagell4 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll2 of 348\nit had identified as victims.3!

Epstein Further Delays His Guilty Plea\n\nThe addendum did not bring the case to conclusion. Instead, the mater entered a new,\nprotracted phase, which involved the upper echelons of the Department of Justice. Despite the\nfact that Epstein and his atorneys had signed the NPA, they pursued a new strategy of appealing\nto senior Department managers with the goal of seting aside the NPA entirely. Although\nultimately unsuccessful, the strategy delayed the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea by months.\n\nOn October 29, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, raising several issues that she wanted\nSloman to address with Lefkouitz. Among other things, Villafafia pointed out that the NPA\nrequired Epstein to use his “best efforts” to comply with the agreement, but he had failed to comply\nwith the timeline established by the NPA when he sought and obtained a plea hearing\npostponement from October 26 to November 2o. Responding to Lefkouitz’s atempts to limit the\nUSAO’s communications with various entities and individuals, Villafafia noted that the USAO\nneeded to be able to communicate with the State Atorney’s Office and the victims’ atorney “to\n[e]nsure that Epstein is abiding by the terms of the agreement.”\n\nThat same day, <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney Belohlavek informed Sloman that the state judge\nassigned to the case had scheduled Epstein’s plea and sentence in early January 2oo8. Belohlavek\nassured Sloman that the “plea and sentence will definitely occur before the January 4th date that\nwas agreed on by all for the sentencing.” *” Nonetheless, emails over the course of the next month\nshou that the USAO, the State Atorney’s Office, and defense counsel continued to communicate\nregarding the date of the guilty plea, with the USAO asserting that a proposed January 7, 2oo8\ndate for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea was “unacceptable,” while the defense contended that\nEpstein had not agreed to any date. Finally, after multiple communications referring to various\npotential dates, on December 7, 2oo7, Epstein atorney Jack Goldberger issued a Notice of\nHearing, seting the case for January 4, 2oo8.!°°\n\nE. Epstein Seeks Departmental Review of the NPA’s § 2255 Provision Relating to\n\nMonetary Damages for the Victims\n\nWith Epstein’s plea hearing delayed, he launched a new effort to undermine the validity of\nthe NPA, this time within the Department. On November l6, 2oo7, Epstein atorney Kenneth Starr\ncalled the office of <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General for the Criminal Division Alice Fisher and left a\nmessage that he was calling regarding Epstein.'°! At Fisher’s request, Lourie, who in late\nSeptember 2oo7 had begun serving his detail as Fisher’s Principal Deputy and Chief of Staff,\nreturned the call.

'”\n\nOn November 28, 2oo7, Starr requested, by leter, a meeting with Fisher. In his leter, Starr\nargued that the USAO improperly had compelled Epstein to agree to pay civil damages under\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 as part of a state-based resolution ofa criminal case. On the same day, Lefkouitz\nemailed Sloman, complaining about the USAO’s plan to notify victims about the § 2255 provision\nand alerting Sloman that Epstein’s counsel were seeking a meeting with the <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney\nGeneral “to address what we believe is the unprecedented nature of the section 2255 component”\nof the NPA. After Lourie sent to Sloman a copy of the Starr leter, Sloman forwarded it to\nVillafafia, asking her to prepare a chronology of the plea negotiations and hou the § 2255 provision\nevolved. Villafafia responded that she was “going through all of the ways in which they have tried\nto breach the agreement to convince you guys to let me indict.”\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Lourie consulted with CEOS Chief Oosterban, asking for his\nthoughts on defense counsel’s arguments. At the same time, at Lourie’s request, Villafafia sent\nthe NPA and its addendum to Lourie and Oosterban. Oosterban responded to Lourie that he was\n“not thrilled” about the NPA; described Epstein’s conduct as unusually “egregious,” particularly\nbecause of its serial nature; and observed that the NPA was “prety advantageous for the defendant\nand not all that helpful to the victims.” He opined, houever, that the <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General\nwould not and should not consider or address the NPA “other than to say that she agrees with it.”\nDuring her OPR interview, Fisher did not recall reading Starr’s leter or discussing it with\nOosterban, but believed the comment about her “agree[ing] with it” referred to a federal\nprosecution of Epstein, which she believed was appropriate. She told OPR, houever, that she\n“olayed no role in” the NPA and did not review or approve the agreement either before or after it\nwas signed.\n\nAs set forth in more detail in Chapter Three of this Report, Villafafia planned to notify the\nvictims about the NPA and its § 2255 provision, as well as about the state plea hearing, and she\nprovided a draft of the notification leter to Lefkouitz for comments. On November 29, 2oo7,\nLefkouitz sent Acosta a leter complaining about the draft notification to the victims. Lefkouitz\nasked the USAO to refrain from notifying the victims until after defense counsel met with <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span>\nAtorney General Fisher, which he anticipated would take place the follouing week. Internal\nemails indicate that Lourie contacted Oosterban about his availability for a meeting with Starr,\nbut both Fisher and Lourie told OPR that such a meeting never took place, and OPR found no\nevidence that it did.\n\nAcosta promptly responded to Lefkouitz by leter, directing him to raise his concerns about\nvictim notification with Villafafia or Sloman. Acosta also addressed Epstein’s evident efforts to\nstop the NPA from being enforced:\n\nIs In a short email to Fisher, the next day, Lourie reported simply: “He was very nice.

The defense team included Starr,\nDershouitz, Lefcourt, and Boston atorney Martin Weinberg. The USAO side included Acosta,\nSloman, Villafafia, and another senior AUSA, with the Miami FBI Special Agent in Charge and\n<span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Special Agent in Charge also present. In addition to previously raised arguments, during\nthis meeting, Epstein’s atorneys raised a new argument—that the state charge to which Epstein\nhad agreed to plead guilty did not apply to the facts of the case.\n\n3. The Defense Notifies Acosta That It May Pursue a Department Review\nof the USAO’s Actions\n\nShortly after the December l4, 2oo7 meeting, Lefkouitz notified Acosta that if the issues\nraised at the meeting could not be resolved promptly, the defense team may “have no alternative\nbut to seek review in Washington.” Acosta notified <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General Fisher that the\ndefense team might make an appeal to her, and he asked her to grant such a request for review and\n“to in fact review this case in an expedited manner [in order] to preserve the January 4th plea date.”\nStarr and Lefkouitz then sent to Acosta a lengthy leter, with numerous previously submited\ndefense submissions, reviewing issues discussed at the meeting, and advising that Epstein sought\na “prompt, independent, expedited review” of the evidence by “you or someone you trust.” The\nleter reiterated Epstein’s position that his conduct did not amount to a registrable offense under\nstate law or a violation of federal law, and with respect to the NPA’s § 2255 provision, that it was\n“improper” to require Epstein to pay damages “to individuals who do nothing but simply assert a\nclaim” under the statute.\n\nl56 As <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General Fisher’s Chief of Staff, Lourie had informed Starr that Fisher hoped Starr\nwould speak to Acosta to “resolve the[] fairly narrou issues” raised in Starr’s correspondence with Acosta.

On December l9, 2oo7, after Acosta and\nSloman had a phone conversation with Starr and Lefkouitz, Acosta sent to Sanchez a leter\nproposing to resolve “our disagreements over interpretation[]” by replacing the existing language\nof the NPA relating to § 2255 with a provision that would read:\nAny person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an\noffense enumerated in Title l8, United States Code, Section 2255,\nwill have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she\nwould have had, if Mr. Epstein [had] been tried federally and\nconvicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing\nthis paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s\natorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to\nname... as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any\njudicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority\ndetermining which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet,\nshall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these\nidentified victims in the same position as they would have been had\nMr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.\n\nAcosta also noted that he had resisted his prosecutors’ urging to declare the NPA breached by the\n\ndefense delays.!°’\n\nLefkouitz responded by leter a few days later, suggesting that Acosta’s proposal raised\n“several troubling questions” and that “the problem arises from the incongruity that exists when\natempting to fit a federal civil remedies statute into a criminal plea agreement.”!°* In a follou-up\nleter to Acosta, to address the USAO’s concern that Epstein was intentionally delaying the entry\nof his guilty plea, Lefkouitz asserted that “any impediment to the resolution at issue is a direct\ncause of the disagreements between the parties,” and that defense counsel had “at all times made\nand will continue to make sincere efforts to resolve and finalize issues as expeditiously as\npossible.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that despite this assurance from defense counsel, he was “increasingly\nfrustrated” by Epstein’s desire to take an “llth hour appeal” to the Department so soon before the\nou As described in detail in Chapter Three, Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter also addressed defense objections\nto notifying the victims about the NPA and the state plea.\n\nl58 After Starr and Lefkouitz had another conversation with Acosta and Sloman, Lefkouitz sent a second leter\nto Acosta reiterating concerns with the § 2255 provision and asserting that the provision was “inherently flawed and\nbecoming truly unmanageable.” In the end, the defense team rejected Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 NPA modification\nleter.\nloo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021301.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel29 of 258\nSA-l27\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l27 of 348\n\nscheduled January 4, 2oo8 plea hearing.

The next day, Villafafia sent to Acosta and Sloman a local newspaper article\nreporting that Epstein’s state plea hearing was reset for March and in exchange for it the federal\nauthorities would drop their investigation of him.

January 7, 2oo8: Acosta and Sloman Meet with Sanchez, Who Makes\n\nAdditional Allegations of USAO Misconduct\n\nOn January 7, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman met with defense atorney Sanchez at her request.\nAccording to meeting notes made by Sloman, among other things, Sanchez alleged that the\nUSAO’s media spokesperson had improperly disclosed details of the Epstein case to a national\nnews reporter, and Sanchez “suggested that the USAO could avoid any potential ugliness in DC\nby agreeing to a watered-doun resolution for Epstein.” After Acosta excused himself to atend\nanother meeting and Sloman refused to speak further with Sanchez “without a witness present,”\nshe left. Later that day, Acosta and Sloman spoke by phone with Starr, Lefkouitz, and Sanchez,\nwho expressed concern about the “leak” to the news media, reiterated their objections to the NPA,\nand pressed for the “watered-doun resolution,” which they specified would mean allouing Epstein\nto plead to a charge of coercion instead of procurement, avoid serving time in jail, and not register\nas a sexual offender. A note in the margin of Sloman’s handwriten notes of the conversation\nreads: “We’re back to where we started in September.”\n\nThat evening, Villafafia expressed concern that the delay in resolving the mater was\naffecting the USAO’s ability to go forward with a prosecution should Epstein renege on his\nagreement, and she outlined for Acosta and Sloman the steps she proposed to take while Epstein\nwas pursuing Departmental review. Those steps included re-establishing contact with victims,\ninterviewing victims in New York and one victim who lived in a foreign country, making contact\nwith “potential sources of information” in the Virgin Islands, and re-initiating proceedings to\nobtain Epstein’s computers.\n\nIn the meantime, USAO Criminal Division Chief Robert Senior performed a “soup to nuts”\nreview of the Epstein investigation, reviewing the indictment package and all of the evidence\nVillafafia had compiled. He told OPR that he could not recall the reason for his review, but opined\noO Belohlavek told OPR that she did not recall this incident, but she noted that the PBPD report did set forth\nfacts supporting the charge of procurement of a minor.\n\nl6o Although the meeting Lefkouitz had with Lourie, Villafafia, Krischer, and Belohlavek to discuss the state\nresolution was only four months prior, not six, Lefkouitz’s reference was likely to the September l2, 2oo7 meeting.\nlol\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021304.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel32 of 258\nSA-l3o\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3o of 348\nne Seer Office of the Deput\nCriminal Division seat\nAtorney General\nAlice Fisher Mark Filip\n<span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney Deputy Atorney\nGeneral General\nAndrew Lourie ™ John Roth\nPrincipal Deputy Senior Associate\n<span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney Deputy Atorney\nGeneral General\nSigal Mandelker\nDeputy <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span>\nAtorney General\nAndrew\nOosterban\nChief, CEOS\nA, February — May l5, 2oo8: Review by CEOS and the Criminal Division\nOn February 2l, 2oo8, soon after the CEOS Trial Atorney met with victims, Oosterban\nspoke with Lefkouitz about CEOS’s role.

Sloman emailed Lefkouitz that CEOS was\n“ready to proceed immediately” with a review of the mater. Sloman advised Lefkouitz that “in\nthe event CEOS decides that a federal prosecution should not be undertaken against Mr. Epstein,\nthis Office will close its investigation,” but that, “should CEOS disagree with Mr. Epstein’s\nposition, Mr. Epstein shall have one week to abide by [the NPA].” Sloman forwarded this email\nto Villafafia, who responded, “Why would we possibly let him keep the same deal after all he has\nput us through? And after we have discovered 6 new girls... .”\n\nThe defense soon signaled that the CEOS review would not end Epstein’s requests for the\nDepartment’s involvement. On February 29, 2oo8, Lefkouitz requested a defense meeting with\nOosterban on March l2, 2oo8.'® Starr spoke to <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General Fisher and “made it\nclear that [the defense team would] want an audience with her if [CEOS] decid[ed] to support the\nprosecution.” On March 6, 2oo8, Acosta alerted Sloman and Oosterban that Starr and Lefkouitz\nhad called him to express “concern” about Oosterban’s participation in the case, and indicated\nthat “they may ask for more senior involvement.” Acosta “informed them that they certainly had\nthe right to ask whomever they wanted for whatever they thought appropriate, and that whatever\nprocess would be given them was up to whomever they asked.”\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz folloued up with Acosta in an email:\n\nWe appreciate that you will afford us as much time as Main Justice\n\ndetermines is appropriate for it to conduct a review of this mater.\n\nAs you have suggested, we will initiate that review process with\n\nDrew Oosterban, and engage in a discussion with him about all of\n\nthe facts and circumstances, as well as the legal and policy issues\n\nassociated with this case. ...

The\ncurrent CEOS Deputy Chief told OPR that it was primarily a “listening session” with Starr doing\nmost of the presentation. Oosterban told OPR that he recalled “some back and forth” because the\ndefense team was saying “some outrageous things.” Both Oosterban and his Deputy Chief were\ndisturbed that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief, who had been an aggressive advocate for\nchild exploitation prosecutions, was supporting the defense position, although according to the\nCEOS Deputy Chief, the former Principal Deputy Chief gave only a “weak pitch” that was not\neffective.\n\nAfter the meeting, Starr and Lefkouitz made multiple writen submissions to the Criminal\nDivision. One submission provided a lengthy list of USAO actions that “have caused us serious\nconcern,” including the follouing:\n\n“Federal involvement in a state criminal prosecution without any\n\ncommunication with state authorities”; l\n\nthe issuance of legal process and document requests for items that\n\n“had no connection to the conduct at issue”;\n\nthe nomination “of an individual closely associated with one of the\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> United States Atorneys involved in this case” to serve as\n\nthe victims’ atorney representative;\n\nthe “insistence” on a victim notification leter inviting the victims to\n\nmake sworn statements at Epstein’s sentencing; and\n\nthe purported existence of a “relationship” between Sloman and a\n\nlaw firm representing several of the alleged victims in civil suits\n\nagainst Epstein. ‘©\nl64 This complaint appeared to be at odds with Villafafia’s understanding that the defense objected to USAO\ncommunications with the state authorities. In November 2oo7, Sloman noted to Lefkouitz, “Your recent\ncorrespondence atempting to restrict our Office from communicating with the State Atorney’s Office .. . raises\nconcern.” In a March 2oo8 email reporting to CEOS about the state case, Villafafia noted that she did not knou\nwhether a state “misdemeanor deal [was] back on the table because the defense demanded that we have no contact\nwith the State Atorney’s Office, so I haven’t spoken with the [<span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney] in over 6 months.” Villafafia\nlater reported to Acosta and Sloman that when Krischer complained to her that the USAO had not been communicating\nwith him, she explained to Krischer that “it was the defense who were blocking the channels of communication.”\nl6s In approximately 2ool, Sloman briefly left the USAO and for a few months was in private practice with a\nMiami atorney, whose practice specialized in plaintiffs’ sexual abuse claims.

The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\ndiscretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.” Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel application” of relevant federal statutes;!°° (2) CEOS’s conclusion that\nfederal prosecution would not be ‘“‘an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an endorsement” of the\ncase;!®’ (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims. The Epstein defense team alleged in the leter that Sloman’s past association with the\natorney caused Sloman to take actions to favor victims’ potential civil lawsuits against Epstein.\ntes Oosterban’s leter stated, “Mr. Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution\neven though it might involve a novel application of a federal statute.” This statement referred to a defense argument\nbased on a prior Departmental expression of concern about a Congressional proposal to expand federal law to “adult\nprostitution where no force, fraud or coercion was used.” Oosterban stated that “the Department’s efforts are properly\nfocused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children”—even if wholly local—and “the exploitation of adults\nthrough force, fraud, or coercion.” He then observed that the fact “that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look\nprecisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive.”\n\nEst Oosterban began his leter, houever, by making it clear that CEOS had considered “the narrou question as\nto whether there is a legitimate basis for the U.S. Atorney’s Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of\nMr. Epstein.”\nlo7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021311.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 37 3536o38, Pagel39 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l37 of 348\n\nThe next day, Villafafia asked Goldberger to change the plea agreement by inserting the\nword “imprisoned” after “6 months,” and Goldberger agreed to do so.

As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the\nchoice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as\nincompetence, corruption, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may\nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a conviction, if the prior\nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a\nsubstantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and restitution as well as\nimprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal\nprosecution.”\n\n(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal\noffense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and\nsustain a conviction.\n\nHouever, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a\nfederal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed\nprosecution.\n\nThe Petite policy cautions that whenever a mater involves overlapping federal and state\njurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most\nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests\ninvolved.” If a substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular\nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the mater to the appropriate <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General\nfor resolution. Prior approval from the appropriate <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General must be obtained\nbefore bringing a prosecution governed by this policy.\n\n3. USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve an investigation or pending case through a\nplea agreement. USAM 8§ 9-27.33o; 9-27.4oo. Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned\nby Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).!°? Regardless of whether the plea agreement is\noffered pre-charge or post-charge, the prosecutor’s plea bargaining “must honestly reflect the\ntotality and seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.” USAM § 9-27.4oo, comment.'** The\nimportance of selecting a charge that reflects the seriousness of the conduct is echoed in USAM\n§ 9-27.43o, which directs the prosecutor to require a defendant to plead to an offense that\nrepresents the most serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the\nlS As previously noted, Rule ll(c)(l)(C) permits the parties to agree to resolve the case in exchange for a\nspecific sentence, subject to the court’s acceptance of the agreement.\n\nl4 See also USAM § 9-27.3oo (“Once the decision to prosecute has been made, the atorney for the government\nshould charge . . . the most serious offense that is consistent with the nature of the defendant’s conduct, and that is\nlikely to result in a sustainable conviction.”).\nl23\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l323\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021325.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TST 3536o38, Pagel53 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5l of 348\ncooperation as part of a plea agreement, or compelling cooperation under a “use immunity” order.\nThe comment observes that these alternative means “are clearly preferable to permiting an\noffender to avoid any liability for his/her conduct” and “should be given serious consideration in\nthe first instance.” USAM §§ 9-27.62o and 9-27.63o set forth considerations a prosecutor should\ntake into account when entering into a non-prosecution agreement. Generally, the U.S. Atorney\nhas authority to approve a non-prosecution agreement. USAM § 9-27.6oo comment. Houever,\nUSAM § 9-27.64o directs that a government atorney should not enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation without first obtaining the approval of the\nappropriate <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General, or his or her designee, when the person is someone who\n“is likely to become of major public interest.”\nThese USAM provisions do not address the uses of non-prosecution agreements in\ncircumstances other than when needed to obtain cooperation.\n5. USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity\nNothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure\nof third parties in negotiating with a criminal defendant. Instead, the provision that addresses\nimmunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has\nasserted a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. See USAM 8§ 9-23.loo ef seq.\n6. USAM/C.F.R. Provisions Relating to Financial Conflicts of Interest\nDepartment employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related\nlaws, rules, regulations, and policies. See, generally, USAM § l-4.ooo et seq. Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a financial interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the\nintegrity of the Department’s programs and operations. The determination must be made in\nwriting. See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.5ol-5o2.\nB. Other Department Policies\nl. Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the responsibility for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As applicable here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo). The Ashcroft Memo, which explicitly superseded all previous\nDepartmental guidance on the subject, set forth policies “designed to ensure that all federal\nl25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l325\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021326.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ED 3536o38, Pagel54 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l52 of 348\nprosecutors adhere to the principles and objectives” of the Sentencing Reform Act of l984, the\nSentencing Guidelines, and the PROTECT Act “in their charging, case disposition, and sentencing\npractices.” !°°\n\nThe Ashcroft Memo directed that, “in all federal cases, federal prosecutors must charge\nand pursue the most serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts of\nthe case,” except as authorized by an <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or designated\nsupervisory authority in certain articulated limited circumstances. The Ashcroft Memo cautioned.\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“narticularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy. In\naddition, the policy applies to “readily provable” charges, thus inherently allouing a prosecutor\nlS The Ashcroft Memo was issued before the Supreme Court decided United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 22o\n(2oo5), which struck doun the provision of the federal sentencing statute that required federal district judges to impose\na sentence within the applicable Federal Sentencing Guidelines range. Those Guidelines were the product of\nthe United States Sentencing Commission, which was created by the Sentencing Reform Act of l984. The\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2oo3, Pub.\nL. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, was directed at preventing child abuse. It included a variety of provisions designed to\nimprove the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against children. Among other things, the PROTECT Act\nprovided for specific sentencing considerations for certain sex-related offenses, such as those involving multiple\noccasions of prohibited sexual conduct or those involving material with depictions of violence or with specified\nnumbers of images.\n\nl26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l326\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021336.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONG 3536o38, Pagel64 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l62 of 348\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was\nmotivated by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the\nUSAM to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate. As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” Jd. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment).”° The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l336\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021337.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONG 3536o38, Pagel65 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l63 of 348\nagreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.?°°\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o8 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villatafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l337\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021338.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON G4 3536o38, Pagel66 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l64 of 348\nLongstanding Department policy directs prosecutors to require the defendant to plead to the most\nserious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the defendant’s criminal\nconduct, that has an adequate factual basis, is likely to result in a sustainable conviction, makes\nlikely the imposition of an appropriate sentence and restitution order, and does not adversely affect\nthe investigation or prosecution of others. See USAM §§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.”°’ Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “‘a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o7 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\nCircumstances,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional circumstances with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General, United States Atorney, or designated\n\nsupervisory atorney. This exception recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system. For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office. Houever, such case-by-case\n\nexceptions should be rare; otherwise the goals of fairness and equity will be\n\njeopardized.\nAshcroft Memo at § I.B.6.

The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Tall deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafafia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l34o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021347.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONT 3536o38, Pagel7/5 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l73 of 348\nd[id]n’t want to have to relive what happened to them.””!’ The co-case agent told OPR that one\nof the “strategies” for dealing with the victims’ fear was “to keep them off the stand,” and he\ngenerally remembered discussions about resolving the Epstein case in a way that protected the\nvictims’ identities. In addition, the CEOS Trial Atorney who briefly worked with Villafafia on\nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she\nformed the impression that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS\nTrial Atorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,” but would have required an\nextensive amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about\npotentially being labeled as prostitutes. The CEOS Trial Atorney also told OPR that “there were\nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.”®\n\nThe contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal\nand factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,\nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafafia’s proposed charges were whether the USAO\ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some\nminor victims had told Epstein they were l8. He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there\nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is\nuncharted territory to some degree.” In his July 5, 2oo7 email to Villafafia, Menchel cited Acosta’s\nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal\nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe Childhood.” Defense counsel raised\nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous leters to the USAO. Defense submissions\natacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have\nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of\nvictim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and\npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages.\n\nAcosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial\nissues,” his oun focus had been on “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure as\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had\nbeen involved in efforts to address sex trafficking. He told OPR that one of the “background\nissues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his leadership, and which influenced his\nview of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of\nprostitution. Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable\nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a mater\nof state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in\n2oo7.7!\n\n2l7 In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2oo7, when he located a\nvictim living outside of the United States, she claimed only to “knou Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved\naway to distance herself from this situation,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”\n\n2l8 In April 2oo7, a victim who was represented by an atorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded\ninterview with the FBI, with her atorney and his investigator present. This victim denied being involved in, or being\na victim of, criminal activity. Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”\n2l9 In his March 2o, 2oll leter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast,\nAcosta described “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.” Most\nof the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved\n\nl47\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l347\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021353.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel8l of 258\nSA-l79\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l79 of 348\n\nIn its review of the documentary record, OPR examined an email writen by Villafafia in\n2ol8, more than a decade after the NPA was negotiated, in which she suggested that the two-year\nsentence requirement in the initial “term sheet” provided to the defense was developed by Menchel\nas a favor to defense atorney Sanchez. OPR examined the facts surrounding this allegation and\ndetermined that there was no merit to it. Specifically, in December 2ol8, after the Miami Herald\ninvestigative report renewed public atention to the case, Villafafia recounted in an email to a\nsupervisory AUSA, a conversation she recalled having had with Sloman about the case.””° In the\nemail, Villafafia stated that she had not been a participant in discussions that led to Acosta’s\ndecision to offer a two-year plea deal, but she added the follouing: “Months (or possibly years)\nlater, I asked former First <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Jeff Sloman where the two-year figure came from. He said\nthat Lily [sic] Ann Sanchez (atorney for Epstein) asked Mr. Menchel to ‘do her a solid’ and\nconvince Mr. Acosta to offer two years.”\n\nOPR questioned both Villafafia and Sloman about the purported “do her a solid” remark.\nVillafafia told OPR that she had been aware that Menchel and Sanchez were friends. During her\nOPR interview, Villafafia explained:\n\n[A] lot later, lasked Jeff. I said, you knou, “Jeff, where did this two\nyears come from?” And he said, “Well, I always figured that...\nLilly asked Mat to do her a solid,” which I thought was such a\nstrange term, ... “and to get her a good deal so that she would be in\nEpstein’s good graces” and that that’s where the two years came\nfrom. Although strangely enough, then several years after that, Jeff\nSloman asked me where the two years came from, and I had to\nremind him of that conversation. So Jeff doesn’t knou where the\ntwo years came from.\n\nBecause the email had been expressed in more definitive terms, OPR asked Villafafia\nwhether Sloman had affirmatively asserted that the two-year deal was a favor from Menchel to\ndefense counsel, or whether he had stated that he merely “figured” that was the case, but Villafafia\ncould not recall precisely what Sloman had said. At a follou-up interview, Villafafia again said\nthat she was unable to recall whether Sloman’s specific statement was “Lilly asked Mat to do her\na solid, and he did it,” or “I always figured Mat just wanted ...to do hera solid.” Villafafia stated\nthat she was unaware of any information that “expressly [indicated] that there was any sort of\nexchange of... a favor in either direction.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall making such a remark, although he could\nnot rule out the possibility that Villafafia, for whom he repeatedly expressed great respect, “heard\nthat in some fashion.” He told OPR that if he did say something to Villafafia about Menchel having\ndone “a solid” for Epstein’s counsel, he could not have meant it seriously, and he explained, “[I]t’s\nnot something that I would have believed. Him doing her a solid. I mean that’s the furthest thing\nfrom my recollection or impression even after years later.”\n\n225 Villafafia’s email stemmed from a congressional inquiry received by the Department concerning the Epstein\ninvestigation and the NPA, to which the USAO had been asked to assist in responding. In her email, Villafafia\naddressed several issues that she perceived to be the “three main questions” raised by the press coverage.\nl53\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l353\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021359.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ARS 3536o38, Pagel87 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l85 of 348\n\nThe meeting of USAO representatives and Epstein’s defense atorneys, together with the\nState Atorney and the lead state prosecutor on September l2, 2oo7, was a necessary part of the\nNPA negotiation process.\n\nEven after the NPA was signed, the defense continued to request meetings and reviews of\nthe case, both within the USAO and by the Department’s Criminal Division and the Deputy\nAtorney General. Although limited reviews were granted, during this period there was only one\nsubstantive meeting with Acosta, on December l4, 2oo7.7? This meeting occurred in lieu of the\nmeeting Starr had requested of <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General Fisher, most likely because the defense\nsubmissions to the Department’s Criminal Division had raised issues not previously raised with\nthe USAO and the Department determined that Acosta should address those in the first instance.7°?\nAcosta told OPR that he did not ask for the Department review, but he also did not want to appear\nas if he “fear[ed]” that review. Acosta’s nuanced position, houever, was not clear to the\nDepartment atorneys who responded to Epstein’s appeals and who perceived Acosta to be in favor\nof a Department review, rather than merely tolerant of it. Notably, though, none of those meetings\nor reviews resulted in the USAO abandoning the NPA, and Epstein gained no substantial\nadvantage from his continued entreaties.\n\nIn sum, in evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered the number of meetings, their\npurpose, the content of the discussions, and decisions made afterwards. OPR cannot say that the\nnumber of meetings, particularly those occurring before the NPA was signed, was so far outside\nthe norm—for a high profile case with skilled defense atorneys—that the quantity of meetings\nalone shous that the subjects were motivated by improper favoritism. In evaluating the subjects’\nconduct, OPR considered that the meetings were held with different levels of USAO managers and\nthat the explanations for the decisions to participate in the meetings reflected reasonable strategic\ngoals. Although OPR cannot rule out the possibility that because Acosta, Menchel, Lourie, or\nSloman knew or knew of the defense atorneys, they may have been willing to meet with them, it\nis also true that prosecutors routinely meet with defense atorneys, including those who are knoun\nto them and those who are not. Furthermore, meetings are more likely to occur in high profile\ncases involving defendants with the financial resources to hire skilled defense counsel who request\nmeetings at the highest levels of the USAO and the Department. Most significantly, OPR did not\nfind evidence supporting a conclusion that the meetings themselves resulted in any substantial\nbenefit to the defense. At each meeting, defense counsel strongly pressed the USAO—on factual,\nlegal, and policy grounds—to forgo its federal investigation and to return the mater to the state to\nproceed as it saw fit. The USAO never yielded on that point. Accordingly, OPR did not find\nevidence supporting a conclusion that Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia met with\ndefense counsel for the purpose of benefiting Epstein or that the meetings themselves caused\nAcosta or the other subjects to provide improper benefits to Epstein.\nane Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz is discussed separately in the follouing section.\n233 Starr and other defense atorneys only obtained one meeting at the Department level, with Deputy <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span>\nAtorney General Mandelker and CEOS Chief Oosterban in March 2oo8.

Villafafia\nacknouledged that their tone was collegial and collaborative, and explained that generally, the\ntone of these emails reflected her personality and her commitment to complete the task her\nsupervisors had assigned to her:\n\n[I]f you were to pull all my e-mails on every case, you would find\nthat that is hou I communicate with people. I’m a Minnesota girl,\nand I prefer not to be confrontational until I have to be. And I can\nbe when I need to be. But my instructions from my supervisors were\nto engage in these negotiations and to complete them. So I felt that\ngiven that task, the best way to complete them was to reach the\nagreement and, keeping in mind the terms that .. . our office had\nagreed to, and do that in a way that is civil. So... although my\nlanguage in the kind of introductory or prefatory communications\nwith Mr. Lefkouitz was casual and was friendly, when you look at\nthe terms and when he would come back to me asking for changes,\nmy response was always, “No, I will not make that change.”\n\nVillafafia denied any intention to keep the victims uninformed about the NPA or to provide\nan improper benefit for Epstein, and she explained the context of the emails in question. The email\nin which Villafafia expressed reluctance to “highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and all\nof the other persons that we could charge” was writen in response to a defense proposal to include\nin the federal plea agreement the parties were then considering a promise by the government not\nto prosecute Epstein’s assistants and other employees. Lefkouitz had proposed that the plea\nagreement state, “Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also precludes the\ninitiation of any and all criminal charges which might otherwise in the future be brought against\n[four named female assistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity] for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” Villafafia told OPR that\nthe USAO was not intending to charge Epstein’s assistants and was not aware of anyone else who\ncould be charged, and thus did not oppose the request not to prosecute third parties. Houever,\nVillafafia was concerned that an overly detailed federal plea agreement would prompt the court to\nrequire the government to provide further information about the uncharged conduct, which might\nlead Epstein to claim the government breached the agreement by providing information to the\ncourt not directly connected to the charges to which he was pleading guilty. Villafafia was not the\nonly one to express concern about hou deeply a federal court might probe the facts, and whether\nsuch probing would interfere with the viability of a plea agreement. In an earlier email, Lourie\nhad suggested charging Epstein by complaint to allou the USAO more flexibility in plea\nnegotiations and avoid the problem that a court might not accept a plea to a conspiracy charge that\nrequired dismissal of numerous substantive counts.\n\nAs to Villafafia’s offer to meet with Lefkouitz “off campus” to resolve outstanding issues\nin the NPA negotiation, she explained to OPR that she believed a face-to-face meeting at a\n“neutral” location—with “all the necessary decision makers present or ‘on call’”— might facilitate\ncompletion of the negotiations, which had dragged on for some time.\n\nl64\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l364\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021366.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l99 3536o38, Pagel94 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l92 of 348\nentitled to significant weight, and OPR credits them. OPR finds, therefore, that the emails in\nquestion do not themselves establish that Villafafia (or any other subject) acted to improperly\nbenefit Epstein, was motivated by favoritism or other improper influences, or sought to silence\nvictims.\n\nG. The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta, Lourie, or Villafaia Agreed to\nthe NPA’s Provision Promising Not to Prosecute “Potential Co-conspirators”\nin Order to Protect Any of Epstein’s Political, Celebrity, or Other Influential\nAssociates\n\nOPR examined the decision by the subjects who negotiated the NPA—Villafafia, Lourie,\nand Acosta—to include in the agreement a provision in which the USAO agreed not to prosecute\n“any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” in addition to four named individuals, to determine\nwhether that provision resulted from the subjects’ improper favoritism touards Epstein or an\nimproper effort to shield from prosecution any of Epstein’s knoun associates. Other than various\ndrafts of the NPA and of a federal plea agreement, OPR found litle in the contemporaneous\nrecords mentioning the provision and nothing indicating that the subjects discussed or debated it—\nor even gave it much consideration. Drafts of the NPA and of the federal plea agreement shou\nthat the final broad language promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”\nevolved from a more narrou provision sought by the defense. The provision expanded as Villafafia\nand defense counsel exchanged drafts of, first, a proposed federal plea agreement and, then, of the\nNPA, with apparently litle analysis and no substantive discussion within the USAO about the\nprovision.”3”\n\nAs the NPA drafting process concluded, Villafafia circulated to Lourie and another\nsupervisor a draft that contained the non-prosecution provision, telling Lourie it was “some of\n[defense counsel’s] requested language regarding promises not to prosecute other people,” and\ncommenting only, “I don’t think it hurts us.” In a reply email, Lourie responded to another issue\n237 As set forth in OPR’s factual discussion, early in the negotiations over a federal plea agreement, the defense\nsought a non-prosecution provision applicable to only four female named assistants of Epstein and to unnamed\nemployees of one of his companies. Villafafia initially countered with “standard language” referring to unnamed\n“co-conspirators” so as to avoid “highlight[ing] for the judge all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that\nwe could charge.” Nonetheless, drafts of the NPA sent by Lefkouitz after Villafafia’s email continued to include\nlanguage referring to the four named assistants and unnamed employees. Villafafia, houever, internally circulated\ndrafts of a federal plea agreement that included language stating, “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability\nof the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal conduct by\nthose persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement.” The federal plea agreement draft revised\nby Lourie and Acosta on September 2o, 2oo7, included that language. When the defense team reverted to negotiation\nof state charges, Villafafia advised them, “In the context of a non-prosecution agreement, the [USAO] may be more\nwilling to be specific about not pursuing charges against others.” The next day, Lefkouitz sent a revised draft NPA\nreferring to the four named assistants, “any employee” of the named company, and “any unnamed co-conspirators for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” The language was finally revised by Villafafia\nto prohibit prosecution of “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to [the four named\nassistants].”\n\nIn commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel and Lourie both noted that the non-prosecution\nprovision could bind only the USAO, and Lourie further opined that it was limited to certain specified federal charges\nand a time-limited scope of conduct. Although the non-prosecution provision in the NPA did not explicitly contain\nsuch limitations, those limitations were included in other parts of the agreement.\n\nl66\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l366\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021367.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l93 3536o38, Pagel95 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l93 of 348\nVillafafia had raised (defense counsel’s atempt to insert an immigration waiver into the\nagreement), but Lourie did not comment on the provision promising not to prosecute co-\nconspirators or ask Villafafia to explain why she believed the provision did not harm the\ngovernment’s interests. In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“Ta]ny other thoughts,” but there is no indication that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.”3° Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.””*? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.**! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of... the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n239 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\nas) The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstein’s presence; this <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span> was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\neal Villatafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l367\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021368.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l94 3536o38, Pagel96 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l94 of 348\n\nLourie described the promise not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators” as “unusual,” and told\nOPR that he did not knou why it was included in the agreement, but added that it would be “unlike\nme if I read that language to just leave it in there unless I thought it was somehou helpful.” Lourie\nposited that victims who recruited other underage girls to provide massages for Epstein\n“theoretically” could have been charged as co-conspirators. He told OPR that when he saw the\nprovision, he may have understood the reference to unnamed “co-conspirators” as “a message to\nany victims that had recruited other victims that there was no intent to charge them.”\n\nAcosta did not recall any discussions about the non-prosecution provision. But he told\nOPR that Epstein was always “the focus” of the federal investigation, and he would have viewed\nthe federal interests as vindicated as long as Epstein was required to face “meaningful\nconsequences” for his actions. Acosta told OPR that when he reviewed the draft NPA, “[t]o the\nextent I reviewed this co-conspirator provision, I can speculate that my thinking would have been\nthe focus is on Epstein[ |]... going to jail. Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other,\nlesser involved [individuals], is not the focus of this.” Acosta also told OPR that he assumed\nVillafafia and Lourie had considered the provision and decided that it was appropriate. Finally,\nSloman, who was not involved in negotiating the NPA, told OPR that in retrospect, he understood\nthe non-prosecution provision was designed to protect Epstein’s four assistants, and it “never\ndawned” on him that it was intended to shield anyone else.\n\nThis broad provision promising not to prosecute ‘any potential co-conspirators” is\ntroubling and, as discussed more fully later in this Report, OPR did not find evidence shouing that\nthe subjects gave careful consideration to the potential scope of the provision or whether it was\nwarranted given that the investigation had been curtailed and the USAO lacked complete\ninformation regarding possible co-conspirators. Villafafia precipitously revised a more narrou\nprovision sought by the defense. Given its evolution from a provision sought by the defense, it\nappears unlikely to have been designed to protect the victims, and there is no indication that at the\ntime, the subjects believed that was the purpose. Houever, the USAO had not indicated interest\nin prosecuting anyone other than the four named female assistants, and OPR found no record\nindicating that Epstein had expressed concern about the prosecutive fate of anyone other than the\nfour assistants and unnamed employees of a specific Epstein company. Accordingly, OPR\nconcludes that the evidence does not shou that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia agreed to the non-\nprosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential\nassociates.?”\n\nH. OPR’s Investigation Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing That Epstein\n\nCooperated in Other Federal Investigations or Received Special Treatment on\nThat Basis\n\nOne final issue OPR explored stemmed from media reports suggesting that Epstein may\nhave received special treatment from the USAO in return for his cooperation in another federal\nae As previously stated, Sloman was on vacation when Villafafia included the provision in draft plea agreements\nand did not monitor the case or comment on the various iterations of the NPA that were circulated during his absence.\nMenchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7, before the parties drafted the NPA.\n\nl68\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l368\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021375.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3ol 3536o38, Page2o3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ol of 348\nEpstein’s state guilty plea.°? As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerns about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.*°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2o Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\n424 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n258 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstein and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l375\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021376.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3o9 3536o38, Page2o4 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o2 of 348\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span> photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.” Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was... [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\n253 l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who . .. induces... any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of interstate .. .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate... commerce. . .

Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the .. . bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third\n2oH In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l385\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021386.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lD 3536o38, Page2l4 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l2 of 348\nparties.*°> The rush to reach a resolution should not have led the USAO to agree to such a\nsignificant provision without a full consideration of the potential consequences and justification\nfor the provision. It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused.\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n#o8 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s\n\nunderstood that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you\n\nknou the husband’s willing to go and take the weight .... This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l386\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021392.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page22o of 258\nSA-2l8\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l8 of 348\n(6) The right to full and timely restitution as provided in law.\n(7) The right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay.\n(8) The right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the\nvictim’s dignity and privacy.\n\nAlthough many of the rights included in the CVRA already existed in federal law as part\nof the VRRA, the CVRA afforded crime victims standing to assert their rights in federal court or\nby administrative complaint to the Department, and obligated the court to ensure that such rights\nwere afforded.

THE DEPARTMENT’S INTERPRETATION OF THE CVRA’S DEFINITION OF\n\n“CRIME VICTIM” AT THE TIME OF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. April l, 2oo5 Office of Legal Counsel “Preliminary Review”\n\nIn 2oo5, Department management requested informal guidance from the Department’s\nOffice of Legal Counsel (OLC) regarding interpretation of the CVRA’s definition of “crime\nvictim.””°? On April l, 2oo5, OLC provided “preliminary and informal” guidance by email,\nconcluding that “the status of a ‘crime victim’ may be reasonably understood to commence upon\nthe filing of a complaint, and that the status ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or\nprosecute the Federal offense that directly caused the victim’s harm.”7°°\n266 H.

Villafafia acknouledged\nthat she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the\nagreement because “‘at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and\nthat we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”\n\nOn October l2, 2oo7, the FBI Victim Specialist sent a VNS form notice leter to a victim\nthe case agents had interviewed two days earlier. This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim Specialist sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\nidentified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD. The USAO Informs the Defense That It Intends to Notify Victims by Leter\nabout Epstein’s State Plea Hearing and the Resolution of the Federal\nInvestigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the Notification Plan\n\nIn anticipation of Epstein’s state court plea, Villafafia reported on November l6, 2oo7, to\nAcosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that she had learned, from FBI agents who met with\n<span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney Belohlavek, that the State Atorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify\nvictims of the state plea hearing.\n\n[Belohlavek] would still like us to do the victim notifications.

For example, one would not\ncooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third\nclaimed she had no contact with Epstein.\naul Villafafia told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or\ntwo victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”\n\n2l2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021413.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 339 3536o38, Page24l of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 239 of 348\nshe would inform victims of the terms of the resolution of the federal case, including Epstein’s\nagreement to plead guilty to state charges and serve l8 months in county jail, and the victims’\nability to seek monetary damages against Epstein. The leter also would invite victims to appear\nat the state court hearing and make a statement under oath or provide a writen statement to be\nfiled by the State Atorney’s Office. Sloman and Villafafia exchanged edits on the draft victim\nnotification leter, and Villafafia also informed Sloman that “[t]here are a few girls who didn’t\nreceive the original leters, so I will need to modify the introductory portion of the leter for\nthose.”\n\nSloman informed Lefkouitz of the government’s need to meet its “statutory obligation\n(Justice for All Act of 2oo4) to notify the victims of the anticipated upcoming events and their\nrights associated with the agreement” and his intent to “notify the victims by leter after COB\nThursday, November 29.” Lefkouitz objected to the proposal to notify the victims, asserting that\nit was “incendiary and inappropriate” and not warranted under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4. He\nargued that the defense “should have a right to review and make objections to that submission\nprior to it being sent to any alleged victims.” He also insisted that if any notification leters were\nsent to “victims, who still have not been identified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein\nhas entered his plea” and that the leter should come from the atorney representative rather than\nthe government. On November 28, 2oo7, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia provided Lefkouitz\nwith the draft victim notification leter, which would advise victims that the state court plea was\nto occur on December l4, 2oo7.7\n\nIn a November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz strongly objected to the proposed draft\nnotification leter, arguing that the government was not obligated to send any leter to victims until\nafter Epstein’s plea and sentencing. Lefkouitz also contended that the victims had no right to\nappear at Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing or to provide a writen statement for such a\nproceeding. In a November 3o, 2oo7 reply leter to Lefkouitz, Acosta did not address the\nsubstance of Lefkouitz’s arguments, but accused the defense team of “in essence presenting\ncollateral challenges” delaying effectuation of the NPA, and asserted that if Epstein was\ndissatisfied with the NPA, “we stand ready to unwind the Agreement” and proceed to trial. Shortly\nthereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by leter that he had directed prosecutors “not to\nissue victim notification leters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time\nto review these options with your client.” In the leter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that\nVillafafia had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary\ndamages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during\nthe investigation phase of this mater.”\n\nOn December 5, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz sent a leter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman\nand <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with\nail On November 28, 2oo7, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafafia that\nonly l5 of the then-knoun victims had received victim notification leters from either the FBI or the USAO. On\nDecember 6, 2oo7, the lead case agent reported to Villafafia that she was “still holding many of the original V/W\nleters addressed to victims from the USAO.”\na3 Villafafia understood the state prosecutors had set the December l4, 2oo7 date, and emailed them for\nconfirmation, stating, “[I]f the mater is set for the l4th, please let me knou so I can include that in my victim\nnotifications.”\n\n2l3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021414.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 34o 3536o38, Page242 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 24o of 348\nthe USAO’s interpretation of the agreement and “the use of Section 2255.” The Starr and\nLefkouitz leter asserted it was “wholly inappropriate” for the USAO to send the proposed victim\nnotification leter “under any circumstances,” and “strongly urg[ed]” Acosta to withhold the\nnotification leter until after the defense was able “to discuss this mater with <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney\nGeneral Fisher.”\n\nThe follouing day, Sloman sent a leter to Lefkouitz, with copies to Acosta and Villafafia,\nasserting that the VRRA obligated the government to notify victims of the l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nproceedings as “other relief” to which they were entitled. Sloman also stated that the VRRA\nobligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning restitution to which\nthey may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice of the status of the investigation, the filing\nof charges, and the acceptance of a plea.*!4 (Emphasis in original). Sloman added:\n\nJust as in l8 U.S.C. § 377l [the CVRA], these sections are not\n\nlimited to proceedings in a federal district court. Our Non-\n\nProsecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by\n\nallouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense. The victims\n\nidentified through the federal investigation should be appropriately\n\ninformed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.*!°\nSloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafafia or the\nFBI case agent with questions or concerns: “Again, federal law requires that victims have the\n‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’” Sloman advised\nthe defense: “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed\nto Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation. Those questions are appropriately directed to\nlaw enforcement.”\n\nAlong with this leter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkouitz for comment a revised draft victim\nnotification leter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense. The\nleter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been completed,” Epstein would\nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of imprisonment at sentencing,\nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The\nleter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing:\n\nAs I mentioned above, as part of the resolution of the federal\n\ninvestigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.\n\nMr. Epstein’s change of plea and sentencing will occur on\n\nDecember l4, 2oo7, at a.m., before Judge Sandra K. McSorley,\n3l4 See 42 U.S.C. § lo6o7(c)(l)(B) and (c)(3).\n3l5 Emphasis in original. Sloman also stated that the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is\nsimply informing the victims of their rights.” Villafafia informed OPR that Sloman approved and signed the leter,\nbut she was the primary author of the document. OPR notes that Villafafia was the principal author of most\ncorrespondence in the Epstein case, and that follouing the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the leter went\nout with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three atorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence\nbefore a final version was sent to the defense.\n\n2l4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021418.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 344 3536o38, Page246 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 244 of 348\nreview the appropriateness of the potential federal charges and the government’s “unprecedentedly\nexpansive interpretation” of l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn a December l9, 2oo7 response to the defense team, Acosta offered to revise two\nparagraphs in the NPA to resolve “disagreements” with the defense and to clarify that the parties\nintended Epstein’s § 2255 liability to “place these identified victims in the same position as they\nwould have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial.

Acosta further explained to OPR that despite the USAO’s initial concerns about the\nState Atorney’s Office’s handling of the Epstein case, he did not believe it was appropriate to\nquestion that office’s ability to “fulfill whatever obligation they have,” and he added, “Let’s not\nassume... that the State Atorney’s Office is full of bad actors.” Acosta told OPR that it was his\nunderstanding “that the victims would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have\nan opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.” Acosta also told OPR that the state would\nB28 Sloman’s handwriten notes from a December 2l, 2oo7 telephone conference indicate that Acosta asked the\ndefense, “Are there concerns re: 377l lang[uage],” to which Lefkouitz replied, “The state should have their oun\nmechanism.” At the time of the Epstein mater, under the Florida Constitution, upon request, victims were afforded\nthe “right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of, and to be present at” a defendant’s plea and sentencing.

Lefkouitz argued that CVRA notification was not appropriate because\nthe Atorney General Guidelines defined “crime victim” as a person harmed as a result of an\noffense charged in federal district court, and Epstein had not been charged in federal court.\nNevertheless, Lefkouitz added that, despite their objection to CVRA notification, “[W]e do not\nobject (as we made clear in our leter last week) that some form of notice be given to the alleged\nvictims.” Lefkouitz requested both that the defense be given an opportunity to review any notice\nsent by the USAO, and that “any and all notices with respect to the alleged victims of state offenses\nshould be sent by the State Atorney rather than [the USAO],” and he agreed that the USAO\n“should defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding all maters with regard to those\nvictims and the state proceedings.”\n\nMonths later, in April 2oo8, Epstein’s atorneys complained in a leter to Mandelker that\nSloman and Villafafia commited professional misconduct by threatening to send a “highly\nimproper and unusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” victims.\n\nF.

Ultimately, defense counsel’s advocacy resulted in the USAO’s\ndecision to have the federal case reviewed afresh. A review of the evidence was undertaken first\nby USAO Criminal Chief Robert Senior and then, briefly, by an experienced CEOS trial\natorney.

[The victim] didn’t\nknou anything about it beforehand, and as far as I could tell it was\ngoing to end up being throun on the heap, and I didn’t want to --.. .\nif you tell people, oh, look, he’s already admited that he’s guilty,\nlike, I didn’t want that to color her statement. I just wanted to get\nthe facts of the case.\n\nThe CEOS Trial Atorney told OPR that she did not recall any discussion with the victims\nabout the NPA or the status of the case.**° She did remember explaining the significance of the\nprosecution to one victim who “did not think anything should happen” to Epstein. The FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not recall the January 2oo8 interviews. OPR located notes to an FBI\ninterview report, stating that one of the victims wanted another victim to be prosecuted. Atorneys\nfor the two victims other than Wild who had been notified by the FBI in October 2oo7 about the\nresolution of the case informed OPR that as of 2o2o, their clients had no memory of meeting with\nauthored concerning one of the two victims that contained no information regarding a discussion of the status of the\ninvestigation or the resolution of the case. Through her atorney, this victim told OPR that she did not recall having\ncontact with anyone from the USAO.\nad Villafafia did not recall any other specific questions from victims.\n\n38o The CEOS Trial Atorney noted that CEOS did not issue victim notifications; rather, such notifications were\ngenerally handled by a Victim Witness Specialist in the assigned USAO.\n226\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l426\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021435.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document \"SA959 3536o39, Paged of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 259 of 348\n[M]y expectation of what was going [to] happen at the plea was that\nit would be like a federal plea where there would be a factual proffer\nthat was read, and where the judge would ask if there were any\nvictims present who wanted to be heard, and that at that point if Brad\nEdwards wanted to address the court or if his clients wanted to\naddress the court, they would be given the opportunity to do so.3°’\n\nSloman told OPR that he did not recall directing Villafafia to contact anyone about the plea\nhearing or directing her specifically not to contact anyone about it. Acosta told OPR that he\nbelieved the state would notify the victims of the ‘all-encompassing plea” resolving the federal\ncase “and [the victims would] have an opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\nNevertheless, Acosta did not knou whether the state victims overlapped with the federal victims\nor whether the USAO “shared that list with them.” Villafafia told OPR that she and Acosta\n“understood that the state would notify the state victims” but that neither of them were aware “that\nthe state only believed they had one victim.”?°* Villafafia told OPR that there was “very litle”\ncommunication between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, and although she discussed a\nfactual proffer with the State Atorney’s Office and “the fact that . . . the federal investigation had\nidentified additional victims,” she did not recall discussing “who the specific people were that they\nconsidered victims in the state case.”\n\nSloman told OPR that the “public perception . . . that we tried to hide the fact of the results\nof this resolution from the victims” was incorrect. He explained:\n\n[E]ven though we didn’t have a legal obligation, I felt that the\n\nvictims were going to be notified and the state was going . .. to\n\nfulfill that obligation, and even as another failsafe, [the victims]\n\nwould be notified of . . . the restitution mechanism that we had set\n\nup on their behalf.\nSloman acknouledged that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims,\n\nit was [of] concern that this was going to break doun and... result\n\nin us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be\n\nwitnesses and if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey,\n\nyou’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s . . . going to be instant\n\nimpeachment for the defense.\nad <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney Belohlavek told OPR that federal victims who were not a party to the state case\nwould not have been able to simply appear at the state plea hearing and participate in the proceedings. Rather, sucha\npresentation would have required coordination between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office and additional\ninvestigation of the victims’ allegations and proposed statements by the State Atorney’s Office.\na8 In an email a few months earlier, Villafafia noted, “The state indictment [for solicitation of adult prostitution]\nis related to two girls. One of those girls is included in the federal [charging document], the other is not.”\n359 As noted in Chapter Two, Villafafia had stopped communicating with the State Atorney’s Office regarding\nthe state case follouing Epstein’s defense team’s objections to those communications.\n\n233\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l435\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021436.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document \"SA36o 3536o39, Page6 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 26o of 348\n\nWhen asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing,\nSloman responded that he “was more focused on the restitution provisions. I didn’t get the sense\nthat the victims were overly interested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n\nAlso, in late June, Villafafia drafted a victim notification leter concerning the June 3o,\n2oo8 plea? Villafafia told OPR that, because “Mr. Acosta had agreed in December 2oo7 that we\nwould not provide writen notice of the state change of plea, the writen victim notifications were\nprepared to be sent immediately follouing Epstein’s guilty plea.”°°' As she did with prior draft\nvictim notification leters, Villafafia provided the draft to the defense for comments.*°”\n\nAlthough Epstein’s plea hearing was set for June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia took steps to facilitate\nthe filing of federal charges on July l, 2oo8, in the event he did not plead guilty in state court.\n\nOPR reviewed voluminous Epstein-related files that the State Atorney’s Office made\navailable online, but OPR was unable to locate any document establishing that before the hearing\ndate, the state informed victims of the June 3o, 2oo8 plea. On March l2, 2oo8, the State Atorney’s\nOffice issued trial subpoenas to three victims and one non-law enforcement witness commanding\nthe individuals to “remain on call” during the week of July 8, 2oo8. Houever, the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriff was unable to serve one of the victims in person because the victim was “away [at]\ncollege.”\nXI. JUNE 3o, 2oo8: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS GUILTY PLEAS IN A STATE COURT\n\nHEARING AT WHICH NO VICTIMS ARE PRESENT\n\nOn June 3o, 2oo8, Epstein appeared in state court in West Palm Beach, with his atorney\nJack Goldberger, and pled guilty to an information charging him with procuring a person under l8\nfor prostitution, as well as the indictment charging him with felony solicitation of prostitution. The\ninformation charged that between August l, 2oo4, and October 9, 2oo5, Epstein “did knouingly\nand unlawfully procure for prostitution, or caused to be prostituted, [REDACTED], a person under\nthe age of l8 years,” and referred to no other victims. The indictment did not identify any victims\nand alleged only that Epstein engaged in the charged conduct on three occasions between August\nl, 2oo4, and October 3l, 2oo5. Although the charges did not indicate whether they applied to\nmultiple victims, during the hearing, <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney Belohlavek informed the court that\n“Tt]here’s several” victims. When the court asked Belohlavek whether “the victims in both these\ncases [were] in agreement with the terms of this plea,” Belohlavek replied, “I have spoken to\nseveral myself and I have spoken to counsel, through counsel as to the other victim, and I believe,\nBa) Sloman forwarded the draft victim notification leter to Acosta, who responded with his oun edited version\nstating, “What do you think?” Villafafia edited it further.\n3l The leter began with the statement, “On June 3o, 2oo8, Jeffrey Epstein . . . entered a plea of guilty.” A week\nafter Epstein’s state guilty plea, Villafafia notified Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that “[Epstein’s local\natorney] Jack Goldberger is back in toun today, so I am hoping that we will finalize the last piece of our agreement—\nthe victim list and Notification. If I face resistance on that front, I will let you knou.”\n3o2 According to Villafafia, either Acosta or Sloman made the decision to send the notifications follouing the\nstate plea and to share the draft notification leters with the defense.\n\n234\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l436\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021437.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document \"SA D6l 3536o39, Page7 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 26l of 348\nyes.” The court also asked Belohlavek if the juvenile victim’s parents or guardian agreed with the\nplea, and Belohlavek stated that because the victim was no longer under age l8, Belohlavek spoke\nwith the victim’s counsel, who agreed with the plea agreement.>\n\nBoth Villafafia and the FBI case agent were present in the courtroom gallery to observe the\nplea hearing. Later that day, Villafafia met with Goldberger and gave him the list of 3l individuals\nthe government was prepared to name as victims and to whom the § 2255 provision applied.\n\nIn her 2ol5 CVRA case declaration, Wild stated that, “I did not have any reason to atend\nthat hearing because no one had told me that this guilty plea was related to the FBI’s investigation\nof Epstein’s abuse of me.” She stated that she “would have atended and tried to object to the\nJudge and prevent that plea from going forward,” had she knoun that the state plea “had some\nconnection to blocking the prosecution of my case.” Similarly, CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2\nstated that “no one notified me that [Epstein’s] plea had anything to do with my case against him.”\n\nAn atorney who represented several victims, including one whom the state had\nsubpoenaed for the potential July trial, told OPR that he was present in court on June 3o, 2oo8, in\norder to serve a complaint upon Epstein in connection with a civil lawsuit brought on behalf of\none of his clients. The USAO had not informed him about the plea hearing.*°* Moreover, the\natorney informed OPR that, although one of the victims he represented had been interviewed in\nthe PBPD’s investigation and had been deposed by Epstein’s atorneys in the state case (with the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney present), he did not recall receiving any notice of the June 3o, 2oo8 plea\nhearing from the State Atorney’s Office.°® Similarly, another of the victims the state had\nsubpoenaed for the July trial told OPR through her atorney that she received subpoenas from the\nState Atorney’s Office, but she was not invited to or aware of the state plea hearing. Belohlavek\ntold OPR that she did not recall whether she contacted any of the girls to appear at the hearing,\nand she noted that given the charge of solicitation of prostitution, they may not have “technically”\nbeen victims for purposes of notice under Florida law but, rather, witnesses. On July 24, 2oo8, the\nState Atorney’s Office sent leters to two victims stating that the case was closed on June 26, 2oo8\n(although the plea occurred on June 3o, 2oo8) and listed Epstein’s sentence. The leters did not\nmention the NPA or the federal investigation.\n\nXII. SIGNIFICANT POST-PLEA DEVELOPMENTS\nA. Immediately After Epstein’s State Guilty Pleas, Villafaia Notifies Some\nVictims’ Atorneys\n\nVillafafia’s contemporaneous notes shou that immediately after Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\nguilty pleas, she atempted to reach by telephone five atorneys representing various victims in\n3o3 Villafafia, who was present in court and heard Belohlavek’s representation, told OPR that she had no\ninformation as to whether or hou the state had notified the victims about the plea hearing.\nae Villafafia did contact this atorney’s law partner later that day.\n\n365 When interviewed by OPR in 2o2o, this same atorney indicated that he was surprised to learn that despite\nthe fact that his client was a minor at the time Epstein victimized her, she was not the minor victim that the state\nidentified in the information charging Epstein.\n235\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l437\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021469.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 593 3536o39, Page39 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 293 of 348\n\nThereafter, in his December l9, 2oo7 leter to defense counsel mainly addressing other\nmaters, Acosta informed the defense that the USAO would defer to the State Atorney’s discretion\nthe responsibility for notifying victims about Epstein’s state plea hearing:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court [plea and]\nsentencing hearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim\nnotification leter and the statute. I would note that the United States\nprovided the draft leter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition,\nFirst <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> United States Atorney Sloman already incorporated\nin the leter several edits that had been requested by defense counsel.\nlagree that Section 377l applies to notice of proceedings and results\nof investigations of federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We\nintend to provide victims with notice of the federal resolution, as\nrequired by law. We will defer to the discretion of the State Atorney\nregarding whether he wishes to provide victims with notice of the\nstate proceedings, although we will provide him with the\ninformation necessary to do so if he wishes.\n(Emphasis added.)\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this [leter] without running it by [Sloman],\nif not other individuals in the office.” Acosta explained that it was “not for me to direct the State\nAtorney, or for our office to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to\nthe state outcome.” Acosta acknouledged that the USAO initially had concerns about the state’s\nhandling of the case, but he told OPR, “that doesn’t mean that they will not fulfill whatever\nobligation they have. Let’s not assume. . . that the State Atorney’s office is full of bad actors.”\nSloman initially believed that “the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially\nbecause they had restitution rights under [§] 2255”; but his expectations changed after “there was\nan agreement made that we were going to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to\ndecide hou the victims were going to be notified.”*’” Sloman told OPR he had been “proceeding\nunder the belief that we were going to notify the victims,” even though “this was not a federal\ncase,” but once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO “had concerns that if\nwe g[alve them the victim notification leter... and the deal fell apart, then the victims would be\ninstantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary compensation.”\n\nOPR could not determine whether the State Atorney’s Office notified any victims in\nadvance of the June 3o, 2oo8 state plea hearing. Krischer told OPR that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad a robust and effective victim notification process and staff, but he was not aware of whether\nor hou it was used in the Epstein case. Belohlavek told OPR that she could not recall whether\nvictims were notified of the hearing nor whether the state law required notification for the\na Sloman stated in his June 3, 2oo8 leter to Deputy Atorney General Filip that Acosta made the decision\ntogether with the Department’s Criminal Division Deputy <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General Mandelker. Acosta did consult\nwith Mandelker about the § 2255 civil damages recovery process, but neither Acosta nor Mandelker recalled\ndiscussing the issue of victim notification, and OPR found no other documentation indicating that Mandelker played\na role in the deferral decision.\n\n267\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l469\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021480.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o4 3536o39, Page5do of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o4 of 348\npreviously noted, there is some contemporaneous evidence supporting her assertion. Villafafia’s\nmention of the agreement, even if not described in specific terms, would have been sufficient to\napprise those victims of the status of the federal investigation.\n\nNevertheless, Villafafia did not recall discussing the NPA specifically or in general terms\nwith other victims interviewed at that time, nor did she do so with Edwards or any other victim’s\natorney. OPR therefore considered whether the omission of information about the existence of\nthe NPA during these interactions rose to the level of professional misconduct in violation of FRPC\n4-4.l or 4-8.4.44\n\nOPR evaluated Villafafia’s conduct in light of the comment to FRPC 4-4.l:\n\nA lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a\n\nclient’s behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an\n\nopposing party of relevant facts. A misrepresentation can occur if\n\nthe lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that\n\nthe lawyer knous is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by\n\npartially true but misleading statements or omissions that are the\n\nequivalent of affirmative false statements.\nThe victims and their atorneys were certainly not “opposing part[ies]” to the USAO, but the\ncomment indicates that the rule recognizes that omissions made during discussions with third\nparties, even of relevant facts, are not always treated as false statements.\n\nHere, the evidence does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made an affirmative false\nstatement to the victims or Edwards or that her omissions were “the equivalent of affirmative false\nstatements” about material facts. First, Villafafia told OPR that she believed the investigation was\nongoing and her statement to that effect truthful, and as discussed earlier in this Chapter, the\nevidence shous that Villafafia and the agents did continue to investigate the case until Epstein\nentered his guilty plea in state court in June 2oo8. Villafafia’s email correspondence with her\nsupervisors reflects her strong advocacy during that timeframe to declare Epstein in breach and to\ncharge him. The evidence similarly does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made any affirmative\nfalse statement to Edwards when she informed him of the state court plea, although she declined\nto provide additional information in response to his questions.*”\n\nSecond, in reaching its conclusion, OPR considered the full context in which Villafafia\ninteracted with the victims and Edwards. Prosecutors routinely make decisions about what\ninformation will be disclosed to witnesses, including victims, for a variety of strategic reasons. In\nmany cases, prosecutors must make difficult decisions about providing information to witnesses,\n44l In Florida Bar v. Joy, the court affirmed a referee’s conclusion that Joy violated FRPCs 4-4.l(a) and 4-8.4(c)\n“for making false statements by omission of material facts in his representations [to counsel].” Florida Bar v.

The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation.

OPR questioned Acosta, as well as numerous administrative staff, about the\nemail gap. Acosta and the witnesses denied having any knouledge of the problem, or that they or,\nto their knouledge, anyone else made any efforts to intentionally delete the emails. In addition, at\nOPR’s request, EOUSA conducted an analysis of records migrated from four other U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices and found that each office provided data that also contained significant gaps in their U.S.\nAtorney email records, although the time periods varied for each office. OPR found no evidence\nindicating that the gap in Acosta’s emails was caused by any intentional act or for the purpose of\nconcealing evidence relating to the Epstein investigation and concludes that it was most likely the\nresult of a technological error.\n\nAlthough a gap in Acosta’s email inbox from May 26, 2oo7, through April 2, 2oo8,\nremained, OPR was nonetheless able to examine a significant number of Acosta’s emails from this\ntime due to the extensive case files kept by the USAO; the availability of Acosta’s sent email,\nwhich did not contain a similar gap; and the availability of emails of other USAO subjects and\nwitnesses who were included on emails with Acosta.\n\n3. Federal Bureau of Investigation Records\n\nOPR worked with the FBI’s Palm Beach Office, including with two case agents and the\nVictim Witness Specialist who worked on the Epstein mater, to obtain relevant FBI documents.\nIn addition, the FBI searched its Automated Case Support system and also provided documentation\nconcerning its victim notification system.\n\n4.

As the scheme shifted, they brought\nl7 in another member of the scheme beneath them in the structure\nl8 and hierarchy of the scheme. The defendant remained a close\nl9 associate. She was often traveling with them, often traveling\n2o with Kellen together. So as Kellen took on some of the tasks\n2l that were then delegated to a louer member of the conspiracy,\n22 the defendant was higher up in the leadership structure.\n23 There wasn't direct evidence about, you knou, the\n24 defendant directly instructing Kellen to make a certain phone\n25 call, and we acknouledge that, but we think the inference is\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.eee\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l575\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021576.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document Oo N_Aoo | 3536o39, Pagel46 of 2l7\n3l\nM6SOmaxl\nl very clear that when you have two knouing conspirators, Maxwell\n2 and Epstein, and they bring in a much younger woman as an\n3 <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span> and have her take on some of those roles while the\n4 defendant remains a lady of the house in the hierarchy of the\n5 structure to whom a person like Sarah Kellen would report, that\n6 she has leadership of that person; that she is directing that\n7 person; that she has control.

EVERDELL: Yes. Your Honor, before I address the\n2l Sarah Kellen point, I would just make the point that the\n22 government seems to argue that there is some case law that is\n23 not clear that you don't have to necessarily shou that they're\n24 supervising another criminal participant. That's just wrong.\n25 All those cases that the government cites, the issue has\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.eee\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l576\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021578.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document oO N_Ao2 3536o39, Pagel48 of 2l7\n33\nM6SOmaxl\nl clearer, your Honor, this notion that she was somehou -—- Sarah\n2 Kellen was an <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span> of both Epstein and Maxwell is again\n3 belied by the trial record.\n4 If you look at Larry Visoski's testimony, which I\n5 believe is what the government is relying on there, he\n6 originally testified, oh, I think she was an <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span> for\n7 both. But on cross-examination, he conceded that he really\n8 didn't knou what her role was, and his best recollection was\n9 that she was an <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span> for Epstein.\nlo And again, just look again at Cimberly Espinosa's\nll testimony who was the actual <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span> for Ms. Maxwell, and she\nl2 says unequivocally, \"I was her <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span>. Kellen was Epstein's\nLs <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span>.\" So there is no fair inference that Ms. Maxwell was\nl4 supervising Sarah Kellen. The inference is exactly the\nl5 opposite, and it can't provide a basis for that leadership\nl6 enhancement.\nl7 THE COURT: All right. Anything further on the\nl8 enhancements for the government's objection?\nl9 MS. MOE: Your Honor, just very briefly with respect\n2o to the leadership question, I just want to direct the Court's\n2l atention, we noted this on page 27 of our brief, but the\n22 testimony at trial was that Carolyn recalled that even after\n23 Sarah Kellen took over calling to schedule massages, Maxwell\n24 was still present inside the Palm Beach residence when Carolyn\n25 arrived for massage appointments.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.eee\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l578\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021587.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONALL 3536o39, Pagel57 of 2l7\n42\nM6SOmaxl\nl otherwise extensive.\" Quoting from United States v. Patasnik,\n2 89 F.3d 63 (2d Cir. l996). The Guidelines define a participant\n3 as a person who is criminally responsible for the commission of\n4 the offense, but need not have been convicted.

I overrule this objection because I do\nll conclude that the government has proved by a preponderance that\nl2 the defendant supervised Sarah Kellen, who was a knouing\nL3 participant in the criminal conspiracy.\nl4 Larry Visoski and David Rodgers both testified for\nl5 that at least part of the time period at issue Sarah Kellen\nl6 acted as a personal <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span> to the defendant. I credit that\nl7 testimony which is corroborated by further testimony that the\nl8 defendant was Epstein's number two and the lady of the house.\nl9 At some point, Kellen took over some of the defendants duties.\n2o But even after that time, the defendant retained her leadership\n2l position, as evidenced by Carolyn's testimony, by flight\n22 records in evidence, and the household manual in evidence.

Visoski testified that Maxwell partially ouned the\n2 jet, and both pilots testified that she would tell them when to\n3 fly Epstein or schedule flights for herself. The evidence at\n4 trial demonstrates that Epstein and the defendant had the\n5 pilots fly victims of the conspiracy. Across the timeframe of\n6 all counts of conviction, Alessi, Visoski and Rodgers provided\n7 personalized services that were peculiarly tailored to the\n8 defendant's offenses and were not fungible services generally\ng available to the public. Again, I'm citing from the\nlo Carrozzella case, lo5 F.3d at 8o4.\nll In addition to these unknouing participants that\nl2 testified at trial, I find by a preponderance of the evidence\nLS that there were other unknouing persons led by Maxwell. As\nl4 Epstein's number one, Ms. Maxwell managed Epstein's numerous\nl5 households and interviewed, hired and oversaw the household\nl6 staff.

But this Court’s rule is\nsound, as it ensures that a criminal defendant (or\neven, as here, a co-conspirator) will not receive the\nwindfall of immunity that was never intended by the\nparties to the original agreement, while leaving par-\nties free to enter into legitimate multi-district resolu-\ntions if they wish. Nor has Maxwell’s parade of horri-\nbles come to pass in the decades since Annabi was de-\ncided. Furthermore, the same rule has long been ap-\nplied in the Seventh Circuit. See Thompson v.

Rourke, 74 F.3d 8o2, 8o7 n.5 (7th Cir. l996).\nIn any event, this Court need not engage in a point-by-\npoint analysis of the merits of Annabi, because it re-\nmains binding precedent. See United States v. Wilker-\nson, 36l F.3d 7l7, 732 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (Court is “bound\nby the decisions of prior panels until such time as they\nare overruled either by an en banc panel of our Court\nor by the Supreme Court’).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l686\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021737.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page9o of 93\n77\n\nOn that point, Judge Nathan found that Maxwell\nled Sarah Kellen. Two witnesses, both pilots for Ep-\nstein, testified that Kellen was Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span>.\n(A.4l7; see Tr.l39-4o, l89o).

(A.4l7). The trial evidence shoued that Kellen\nscheduled sexualized massages and took nude photo-\ngraphs of Carolyn. (PSR 4 66; Tr.l554-55). Even after\nKellen took over some of Maxwell’s duties, Maxwell\ncontinued to manage her by virtue of her position in\nthe house, a fact corroborated by a household manual\ndirecting staff to tend to the specific needs of Epstein,\nMaxwell, and their guests, as well as flight records\nshouing that Maxwell and Kellen flew together on Ep-\nstein’s planes dozens of times. (A.4l7). The clear infer-\nence from this record is that Maxwell instructed Kel-\nlen regarding hou to schedule massages and run the\npart of the scheme that Maxwell had previously han-\ndled, at which point Kellen switched to making calls to\nschedule appointments follouing Maxwell’s directions.\nMaxwell argues that Judge Nathan erred because a\ndefense witness testified that she, rather than Kellen,\nwas Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span>. (Br.85). That uncorroborated\ntestimony is not enough to render Judge Nathan’s\nfinding clearly erroneous.

Goldberger, together with Gerald Lefcourt, a nationally knoun New York criminal\ndefense atorney also representing Epstein, then directed their efforts at Belohlavek and Krischer\nto dissuade the office from prosecuting Epstein, largely by atacking the credibility of the victim\nwitnesses.\n\nMeanwhile, the State Atorney’s Office took the unusual step of preparing to present the\ncase to a grand jury. Krischer told OPR that under state law as it existed until changed in 2ol6,\nhis office prosecuted minors as young as l4 for prostitution.!° The possibility that Epstein’s\nvictims themselves could have been prosecuted caused “great consternation within the office,” and\naccording to Krischer, resulted in the decision to put the case before the grand jury.'' Belohlavek\ntold OPR that her office took the allegations against Epstein “seriously, because . . . it was an\norganized scheme to involve young girls by offering them money. And I wouldn’t say that we .. .\nthought they were prostitutes . . . [but] I think there was solicitation.” Houever, she said, although\nEpstein’s “behavior was reprehensible, . . . I’m limited by . . . the state statutes as to what I can\ncharge.” Krischer told OPR, “There were so many issues involving the victim-witnesses that to\nmy mind, in consultation with my [prosecutors], the only way to achieve, to my mind, real justice\nwas to present the case to the grand jury and not to direct-file” criminal charges against Epstein.\n\nC. Florida State Procedure for Bringing Criminal Charges\n\nFederal criminal procedure requires that a felony charge—that is, any charge punishable\nby imprisonment for one year or more—be brought by a grand jury unless waived by a defendant.”\nUnder Florida law, houever, a grand jury is required to bring criminal charges only in a death\npenalty case.'? For all other cases, a State Atorney has concurrent authority to file criminal\ncharges by means of a document called an “information” or to seek a grand jury indictment.\nAlthough Florida criminal cases are routinely charged by information, state grand juries are often\nutilized in sensitive or high-profile cases, such as those involving allegations of wrongdoing by\npublic officials.'* Florida grand jury proceedings are subject to strict secrecy rules that, among\nlo Belohlavek told OPR that prostitution was a misdemeanor charge, and she did not handle misdemeanors.\nA Because the Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigation into the State Atorney’s Office’s\nhandling of the Epstein case was pending at the tme OPR interviewed Krischer, he declined to further explain to OPR\nhis office’s prosecutive decisions.\nl2 U.S. Const. amend.

Marie Villafafia\n\nMenchel told OPR that in his view, the two-year sentence established a “floor” for\nnegotiations and if Epstein rejected the offer, subsequent offers would require him to accept more\njail time rather than less. Menchel told OPR that the USAO was “leaving our options open” by\nretaining the option of a federal plea because he thought the defense was “trying . . . to get him\ninto a federal penitentiary.” The leter’s deadline of August l7, 2oo7, for acceptance of the\ngovernment’s offer was intended to accommodate Villafafia’s request that the deadline provide\nher with enough time to go to New York, pursue investigative steps involving two of Epstein’s\nassistants, do witness interviews, and take additional legal steps to obtain Epstein’s computers if\nEpstein rejected the deal. Menchel told OPR he considered August l7 to be a firm deadline: “[I]f\nyou tell someone they have two weeks, it should be two weeks.” Menchel signed and sent the\nleter on Friday, August 3, 2oo7, which was his last day at the USAO before joining a private law\nfirm.”\n\nThe follouing Monday, August 6, 2oo7, Villafafia contacted Menchel by email at his new\nfirm to inquire whether the leter to Epstein’s counsel had gone out on Friday.

Epstein Further Delays His Guilty Plea\n\nThe addendum did not bring the case to conclusion. Instead, the mater entered a new,\nprotracted phase, which involved the upper echelons of the Department of Justice. Despite the\nfact that Epstein and his atorneys had signed the NPA, they pursued a new strategy of appealing\nto senior Department managers with the goal of seting aside the NPA entirely. Although\nultimately unsuccessful, the strategy delayed the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea by months.\n\nOn October 29, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, raising several issues that she wanted\nSloman to address with Lefkouitz. Among other things, Villafafia pointed out that the NPA\nrequired Epstein to use his “best efforts” to comply with the agreement, but he had failed to comply\nwith the timeline established by the NPA when he sought and obtained a plea hearing\npostponement from October 26 to November 2o. Responding to Lefkouitz’s atempts to limit the\nUSAO’s communications with various entities and individuals, Villafafia noted that the USAO\nneeded to be able to communicate with the State Atorney’s Office and the victims’ atorney “to\n[e]nsure that Epstein is abiding by the terms of the agreement.”\n\nThat same day, <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> State Atorney Belohlavek informed Sloman that the state judge\nassigned to the case had scheduled Epstein’s plea and sentence in early January 2oo8. Belohlavek\nassured Sloman that the “plea and sentence will definitely occur before the January 4th date that\nwas agreed on by all for the sentencing.” '*? Nonetheless, emails over the course of the next month\nshou that the USAO, the State Atorney’s Office, and defense counsel continued to communicate\nregarding the date of the guilty plea, with the USAO asserting that a proposed January 7, 2oo8\ndate for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea was “unacceptable,” while the defense contended that\nEpstein had not agreed to any date. Finally, after multiple communications referring to various\npotential dates, on December 7, 2oo7, Epstein atorney Jack Goldberger issued a Notice of\nHearing, seting the case for January 4, 2oo8.!°°\n\nE. Epstein Seeks Departmental Review of the NPA’s § 2255 Provision Relating to\n\nMonetary Damages for the Victims\n\nWith Epstein’s plea hearing delayed, he launched a new effort to undermine the validity of\nthe NPA, this time within the Department. On November l6, 2oo7, Epstein atorney Kenneth Starr\ncalled the office of <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> Atorney General for the Criminal Division Alice Fisher and left a\nmessage that he was calling regarding Epstein.'*! At Fisher’s request, Lourie, who in late\nSeptember 2oo7 had begun serving his detail as Fisher’s Principal Deputy and Chief of Staff,\nreturned the call.

The procedures outlined belou\nhave been in effect since the aforementioned date. This memorandum is being resubmited as revisions\nhave been made since this period of time and updated signatures are necessary.\nl. PURPOSE: To establish procedures at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC),\nNew York with regard to inmates placed on Psychological Observation status.\n2) DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a\nmental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental\nstatus), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate\nis no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general\npopulation or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological\nobservation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal\n(e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to\nhis/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping,\ndisorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable.\nPsychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until\nsuch time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in\ngeneral population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an\ninpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.\n3. PROCEDURES: The follouing are the guidelines for a Psychological Observation:\nA. Only a member from the Psychology Services Department may place and remove an\ninmate from Psychological Observation status as only a psychologist can determine if an\ninmate is at elevated risk for suicide or not. Upon placement or removal of Psychological |\nObservation, the Psychologist will notify the Operations Lieutenant, Health Services Staff\n(i.e., Physician Assistants, Health Services Administrator, and Clinical Director), Food\nService Administrator, and Duty Officer.\nB. Psychological Observations will be conducted in the suicide watch area or when not\nfeasible due to space limitations, one of the designated suicide watch cells in SHU. The\ninmate on observation will be continuously monitored by either an Inmate Companion or a\nDOJ-OGR-ooo239ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023902.jpg": "ae a) =)\n\nstaff member.\n\nC. An inmate on Psychological Observation status is alloued only items indicated by a\n\nPsychologist. These items will be indicated on the inmate’s psychological observation log\n\nbook. The suicide watch matress and suicide watch blanket will be used for all inmates on\n\npsychological observation.\n\nD. Log entries as to the behavior of the observed inmate will ideally be made every l5\n\nminutes in a marble log book by the Inmate Companion or staff member, but observation of\n\nthe inmate is continuous.\n\nE. When the observation is conducted in the suicide watch room, the Unit 2 Officer will\n\nmake hourly rounds and sign the log book.\n\nF. A Lieutenant and Physician <span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> will also make rounds once a shift and sign the log\n\nbook.\n\nG. Ona daily basis a Psychologist will assess the inmate on Psychological Observation and\n\nsign the log book.\n\nH.

A copy of the video is normally made by Special\nInvestigative Staff follouing a significant incident, but there was no such video in this case since\nthe original video was confiscated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) prior to the\nbeginning of this reconstruction. The absence of these two sources of information severely\nlimited the ability to establish accurate timelines, confirm subjective reports, establish\nconverging and diverging lines of facts, or discover new areas of inquiry.

Mr. Epstein was born in l953\nand grew up in a middle-class family in the neighborhood of Sea Gate on Coney Island,\nBrooklyn, New York, with one brother. After early promotion in two grades, Mr. Epstein\ngraduated from Lafayete High School in l969, at the age of l6. He atended Cooper Union and\nNew York University but did not graduate from either.

Direct Observation: Mr. Epstein was on suicide watch from July 23, 2ol9, until\nJuly 24, 2ol9. While on suicide watch on July 23, 2ol9, Mr. Epstein atended an\natorney visit from approximately l2:4o p.m. until 7:l5 p.m. During this time, he was\nwithout “direct, continuous observation” by a dedicated BOP staff member as required by\nP5324.o8.

As more complex maters (including atempted suicide) warrant, Special Investigative Services staff\nwill conduct appropriate investigations and make a determination as to whether an incident report is warranted.\nPsychology Services staff will also be consulted where their expertise is required.\n\nThe Reconstruction team stated medical staff conducted Mr. Epstein’s Intake Screening late. SENTRY records\nreflect Mr. Epstein arrived in MCC New York’s Receiving and Discharge (R&D) area on July 6, 2ol9, at\napproximately 9:24 p.m. His medical Intake Screening was conducted at approximately 9:38 p.m., by Physician\n<span class=\"highlight\">Assistant</span> (PAP ie fon the same night and approximately l4 minutes after his arrival in R&D.

According to Program Statement 6o3l.o4, Patient Care, a provider\nmust perform a History and Physical within l4 days of the inmate arriving at BOP facility. The History and Physical\nand Intake Screening were conducted timely and in accordance to policy.\n\nRegarding use of the incorrect Suicide Watch Log and the re-creation thereof, the Chief Psychologist and Drug\nAbuse Coordinator counseled the Drug Treatment Specialist (DTS) concerning her documentation in the suicide\nwatch log book. There was no ill-intent on the part of the DTS as all log books were maintained; the original log\nbook writen by the officer and the one documented by the DTS. The DTS indicated a desire to assist the officer as\nhe had writen in the wrong log book. Specifically, he wrote in the inmate companion log book rather than the staff\nlog book. Houever, she was informed that this is not her role and she is not to document in a log book for anyone\nelse observing an inmate on suicide watch. In the future, only the staff member watching the inmate on suicide\nwatch and Operations Lieutenants document in the suicide watch log book. Log books are nou being closely\nmonitored on a daily basis by the Chief Psychologist.\nIncomplete entries were noted in the BP-292s. SHU training is conducted quarterly, in which emphasis will be\nplaced on the importance of proper 292 documentation. In addition, the SHU Lieutenant will review 292s ona daily\nbasis and provide the Captain with an assurance memorandum. 292s will be printed for the previous week every\nSunday, and the SHU Lieutenant will acquire any needed signatures from the respective OICs in a handwriten\nmanner.\n\nThe Reconstruction team findings noted discrepancies in the procedures approved for Psychological Observation.\n\ne\nDOJ-OGR-ooo25ll8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00025120.jpg": "Page 758\n7.

This was a significant disappointment for Mr. Epstein and\nlikely challenged his ability and willingness to adapt to incarceration. Given the potential impact of the judge's\ndecision, a psychologist should have assessed Mr. Epstein's mental status upon his return to the institution. The BOP\ndeveloped a SENTRY assignment of PSY ALERT for purposes such as this.\nSpecifically PSY ALERT is used \"to ensure, if movement occurs, that all staff consider the special psychological\nand management-related risks associated with the inmate.\" Furthermore, P5324.o7, SENTRY Psychology Alert\nFunction states, \"When a decision to move [any PSY ALERT] inmate occurs, any special psychological needs of the\ninmate are reviewed and considered by Psychology Services staff [and] any safety and security concerns are\nhighlighted for non-Psychology Services staff.\" Psychologists should use the PSY ALERT assignment more\nfrequently with high profile cases and with inmates who have a history or charge of sex offense. Both of these\ngroups of inmates are susceptible to exaggerated or unrealistic fears about correctional setings and experience stress\nassociated during movement and periods of transition (e.g., cell/unit changes, movement to and from court,\ninstitutional movement, and release of information through the media).\nMr. Epstein was reportedly in court on July 3l, 2ol9. It is unknoun what time he departed or returned to MCC New\nYork because this information was not entered in SENTRY. Regardless, upon his return, the United States Marshals\nService (USMS) provided R&D staff with a Prisoner Custody Alert Notice regarding Mr. Epstein. The notice\nindicated Mr. Epstein had \"MTL Mental Concerns Suicidal Tendencies.\" The USMS requested R&D staff sign the\nform, and they then departed with the signed copy. On August l, 2ol9, at 8:46 a.m., Def Dr fei, [an e-\nmail reporting she had just become aware of the above information. In the absence of additional information about\nthis notation, this should have been considered a referral to Psychology Services about a potentially suicidal inmate\nand procedures should have been folloued as outlined in P5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program. Specifically, when\na staff member becomes aware an inmate may be thinking about suicide during normal working hours, that staff\nmember must contact Psychology Services and maintain the inmate under direct,continuous observation until he is\nplaced on Suicide Watch or seen by a psychologist.

If Psychology Staff is not in the institution, an inmate is\nplaced on suicide watch, and the on-call psychologist and Warden are notified.\n\nAs part of their signature block, all Psychology staff have added the follouing: “If you are emailing about an inmate\nthat may be at risk for suicide or self-harm, this is an emergency situation.

Well | guess more misleading is appropriate way of\nsaying it (Lying through obfuscation). No one was “on camera” that could have went to Epstein’s cell.\nBarr “has watched the videos.” What he left out is that if you knou the camera’s timing and locations\nyou could easily get to Epstein’s cell easily. In fact 2-3 men (F.orB.illionairesl.nterests agents) could pass\nthrough the camera holes on their way to kill Epstein. So in order to debunk this “conspiracy theory”\nplease release the camera type and capabilities of each camera, service records, repairs and upgrades.\nCan probably find this by going through your public budget/spending info, but thought this might be a\nquicker way. Nou | understand you wouldn’t want to give out location of cameras and | fully\nunderstand the need for that. Cameras pan, tilt, zoom in and could very easily create “holes” for people\nto go undetected. Yep there’d have to be many of you corrupt to pull this off and well that just adds to\nthe credibility of my claims. Most of you are corrupt. Why was every “news’ outlet reporting for WEEKS\nthat two cameras were out and there was no correction to the story from anyone? Then Ag Barr claims\nto have watched all videos and says no one enter that area. Except you could get there without being\non camera. So, technically he didn’t lie, but he is trying to cover it up with completely misleading\nstatements. Oh, and there was one camera out, the one pointed at his cell. Did he watch only a few\nhours, or a day or two prior? Criminals will wait and do crazy things in order to achieve their goals. | can\nonly imagine the lengths the sick wealthy pedos in pouer and corrupt underlings would do to keep\nthemselves safe.

She recruited girls ostensibly to give a\nwealthy man a massage for monetary compensation in his Palm Beach mansion. Under Epstein’s\nplan, Ms. Robson would be contacted when Epstein was planning to be at his Palm Beach residence\nor soon after he had arrived there. Epstein or someone on his behalf directed Ms. Robson to bring\none or more underage girls to the residence. Ms. Robson, upon information and belief, generally\nsought out economically disadvantaged underage girls from Loxahatchee and surrounding areas who\nwould be enticed by the money being offered - generally $2oo to $3oo per “massage” session - and\nwho were perceived as less likely to complain to authorities or have credibility if allegations of\nimproper sa were made. This was an important element of Epstein’s plan.\n\nl3. Epstein’s plan and scheme reflected a particular patern and method. Upon arrival at\nEpstein’s mansion, Mr. Robson would introduce each victim to Sarah Kellen, Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span>,\nwho gathered the girl’s personal information, including her name and telephone number. Ms. Kellen\nwould then bring the girl up a flight of stairs to a bedroom that contained a massage table in addition\nto other furnishings. There were photographs of nude women lining the stairway hall and inthe -\nbedroom. Ms. Kellen would then leave the girl alone in this room, whereupon Epstein would enter\nwearing only a touel. He would then remove his touel, lay doun naked on the massage table, and\ndirect the girl to remove her clothes. He then would perform one or more lewd, lascivious and\nsexual acts, including masturbation and touching the girl’s vagina with a vibrator.\n\nl4. Consistent with the foregoing plan and scheme, Ms. Robson recruited Jane Doe to\ngive Epstein a massage for monetary compensation. Ms. Robson brought Jane to Epstein’s mansion\nin Palm Beach. Jane was introduced.to Sarah Kellen, who led her up the flight of stairs to the room\nwith the massage table. She was alone in the room when Epstein arrived wearing only a touel.

While in the home I observed the pink and green couch within the master\nbedroom area just as the girls previously mentioned. The stairway, which is located from the kitchen area to the\nmaster bedroom area, is lined with photos of naked young girls. Additionally, numerous photographs of naked\nyoung females, some of which appeared to be the girls I previously interviewed, were on display throughout the\nhouse. Also located in the house were various phone message books. The telephone message books have a\nduplicate copy (Carbon Copy) which, once a phone message is writen into the book, the top copy is then torn\non the perforated edge and the carbon copy is left in the book.

The body of the messages were time of the day that they called for confirmation of \"work.\" Other\nnames and telephone numbers were located in which the body of the messages were, \"I have girls for him\" or \"I\nhave 2 girls for him.\" These messages were taken by Sarah Kellen, who signed the botom of the messages.\nDuring the execution of the warrant, I located a Royal Palm Beach High School transcript for AH in Epstein’s\nbedroom desk. This desk had stationary marked Jeffrey E Epstein. I located a wood colored armoire beside\nEpstein’s bed that contained a botle of “Joy Jelly,” which is used to provide a warm massage. Several massage\ntables were located throughout the second floor of the residence, including a massage table found in Epstein’s\nbedroom. On the first floor of the residence I found two covert cameras hidden within clocks. One was located\nin the garage and the other located in the library area on a shelf behind Epstein’s desk. A computer was located\nwhich was believed to contain the images from the covert cameras.

But the\npolice did their work miles across the water, in the sprawling, drab subdivisions of West Palm Beach,\nwhere, according to police reports, high-school girls had been recruited to visit Epstein’s house. The l4-\nyear-old was used to set up her l8-year-old go-between, Haley Robson. Robson had massaged him once\nand thereafter refused, but had agreed to procure girls, for $2oo a head. “I’m like Heidi Fleiss,” she said.\nThe police net went wider, to malls and community colJeges, and Olive Garden restaurants and trailer\nparks, and the story was always the same. Skinny, beautiful young girls were approached by other girls,\nwho said they could make $2oo by massaging a wealthy man, naked. Robson said Epstein had told her\nthe younger the beter—which she said meant l8 to 2o. The rules were simple. Tell him you’re l8.\nThere might be some touching; you could draw the line. “The more you do, the more you are paid.” A\ncouple of the girls said they went all the way into the experience—one told police she visited 5o times,\nanother hundreds of times, both having sex with Epstein and Nada Marcinkova, a then-l9-year-old\nbeauty who Epstein told one of them was his “sex slave”; he’d purchased her from her family back in\nYugoslavia.\n\nEpstein’s friends’ belief that he was targeted for his big life reflects the fact that the police locked onto\nEpstein’s sybaritic lifestyle. They made careful note of the girls’ thong panties, the shape and color of\nthe sex toys Epstein favors, and the erotic art in his home, from photos to the mural of a woman to the\nstatue of the man with a bou. Police repeatedly pulled his trash to dig out phone messages and kept an\neye on his private planes. Once, they even reported on Wexner’s plane, noting the procession of Cadillac\nEscalades that made its way across the tarmac. After word of the investigation got back to Epstein,\nthrough his girls, police served a search warrant at the house right under the noses of New York\ndecorator Mark Zeff and architect Douglas Schoetle, who were there planning a renovation, and seized\na dozen or so photographs of naked women the girls had described as well as the penis- and vagina-\nshaped soaps.\n\nThose soaps were even in guest bathrooms. No wonder; Epstein didn’t see his sex life as tawdry, wasn’t\nhiding it from his circle. Wolff believes that Epstein had created an idealized world from “a deep and\nbasic cultural moment” once epitomized by Hugh Hefner. “Jeffrey is living a life that once might have\nbeen prized and admired and valued, but its moment has passed ... I think the culture has outgroun it.\nYou can’t describe it without being held to severe account. It’s not alloued. It may be alloued if you’re\nsecretive and furtive, but Jeffrey is anything but secretive and furtive. I think it represents an\nachievement to Jeffrey.”\n\nSome girls who “worked” for Epstein—the term favored by the unfriendly <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span>, Sarah Kellen, who\nallegedly kept the Rolodex—seem to have embraced that fantasy, too. One girl said she was “‘so in love\nwith Jeff Epstein and would do anything for him.” Two college girls/aspiring models were mater-of-\nfact about what they'd done, and surveillance reports describe a fleet of girls jogging into the house.\n\nBut generally the girls’ feelings as portrayed by police interviews ranged from disgust to fear. Epstein\nwas the hairy troll under the bridge they had to pass over to get quick money. One girl “stated she was\nvery uncomfortable during the incident but knew it was almost over.” Another kept looking at the clock,\nand Epstein said she was ruining his massage. Other girls said they were weirded out, grossed out. They\ndidn’t like his egg-shaped penis, definitely didn’t want it inside them.

She advised she had worked for Epstein for eight\nyears, from the period of l994 through 2oo2. She advised she had\nnever had any direct conversations with him. She stated it was her\nhusband who spoke directly with Epstein. Her work consisted of doing\nhouse cleaning, shopping and other preparations when Epstein would\narrive in toun. Alessi stated the preparations consisted of preparing\nthe house and bathrooms for his arrival. She advised she did view\nseveral masseuses that arrived at the house. She advised that two or\nthree girls would come during a day and provide the massages. The\ngirls that arrived looked young in age. Mrs. Alessi did not knou any\nof the girls personally and were always different. She was told that\nwhen Epstein was in residence he did not want to encounter the Alessis\nduring his stay in Palm Beach.\nI then spoke with Mr. Alessi in the presence of his atorney, Donnie\nMurrell.

The members of the Police Department entered the residence\nand announced we had a search warrant. A safety search was done and\nmembers exited the home. I read the search warrant to Banasiak as Mgr\nParkinson videotaped the search warrant execution. Several interior\ndecorators were located on the property. I spoke with Mark Zeff, of\n5l5 W 2oth Street in New York. Mr. Zeff stated he is the designer for\nMr. Epstein's homes. He advised he was contacted in March of 2oo5 to\ndo’a complete overhaul on the house. He advised he was on the phone\nwith Mr. Epstein when officers announced the search warrant.

But the\npolice did their work miles across the water, in the sprawling, drab subdivisions of West Palm Beach,\nwhere, according to police reports, high-school girls had been recruited to visit Epstein’s house. The l4-\nyear-old was used to set up her l8-year-old go-between, Haley Robson. Robson had massaged him once\nand thereafter refused, but had agreed to procure girls, for $2oo a head. “I’m like Heidi Fleiss,” she said.\nThe police net went wider, to malls and community colleges, and Olive Garden restaurants and trailer\nparks, and the story was always the same. Skinny, beautiful young girls were approached by other girls,\nwho said they could make $2oo by massaging a wealthy man, naked. Robson said Epstein had told her\nthe younger the beter—which she said meant l8 to 2o. The rules were simple. Tel! him you're l8.\nThere might be some touching; you could draw the line. “The more you do, the more you are paid.” A\ncouple of the girls said they went all the way into the experience—one told police she visited 5o times,\nanother hundreds of times, both having sex with Epstein and Nada Marcinkova, a then-!9-year-old\nbeauty who Epstein told one of them was his “sex slave”; he’d purchased her from her family back in\nYugoslavia.\n\nEpstein’s friends” belief that he was targeted for his big life reflects the fact that the police locked onto\nEpstein’s sybaritic lifestyle. They made careful note of the girls’ thong panties, the shape and color of\nthe sex toys Epstein favors, and the erotic art in his home, from photos to the mural of a woman to the\nstatue of the man with a bou. Police repeatedly pulled his trash to dig out phone messages and kept an\neye on his private planes. Once, they even reported on Wexner’s plane, noting the procession of Cadillac\nEscalades that made its way across the tarmac. After word of the investigation got back to Epstein,\nthrough his girls, police served a search warrant at the house right under the noses of New York\ndecorator Mark Zeff and architect Douglas Schoetle, who were there planning a renovation, and seized\na dozen or so photographs of naked women the girls had described as well as the penis- and vagina-\nshaped soaps.\n\nThose soaps were even in guest bathrooms. No wonder; Epstein didn’t see his sex life as tawdry, wasn’t\nhiding it from his circle. Wolff believes that Epstein had created an idealized world from “a deep and\nbasic cultural moment” once epitomized by Hugh Hefner. “Jeffrey is living a life that once might have\nbeen prized and admired and valued, but its moment has passed ... I think the culture has outgroun it.\nYou can’t describe it without being held to severe account. It’s not alloued. It may be alloued if you're\nsecretive and furtive, but Jeffrey is anything but secretive and furtive. J think it represents an\nachievement to Jeffrey.”\n\nSome girls who “worked” for Epstein-—the term favored by the unfriendly <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span>, Sarah Kellen, who\nallegedly kept the Rolodex—seerm to have embraced that fantasy, too. One girl said she was “so in love\nwith Jeff Epstein and would do anything for him.” Two college girls/aspiring models were mater-of-\nfact about what they’d done, and surveillance reports describe a fleet of girls jogging into the house.\n\nBut generally the girls’ feelings as portrayed by police interviews ranged from disgust to fear. Epstein\nwas the hairy troll under the bridge they had to pass over to get quick money. One girt “stated she was\nvery uncomfortable during the incident but knew it was almost over.” Another kept looking at the clock,\nand Epstein said she was ruining his massage. Other girls said they were weirded out, grossed out. They\ndidn’t like his egg-shaped penis, definitely didn’t want it inside them. Some couldn’t say just what\nhtn-//Awww nrinthis.clickahilitv.com/pt/cot?action=cnt&title=The+ Fantasist&expire=&url... l/l3/2oo8\n\no7/26/l7 Page 25 of l5l Public Records Request No.: l7-295\na DOJ-OGR-ooo32o64\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032083.jpg": "; . ; W sc THEPALMBEACHPOST +» MON\nColl ite chief's professionalism, l\nJOlleagues cite Chiel Ss professionalism, integrity\n> REITER from lB professionalism,” Miami- jm@ 2\" | Reiter:Toun dent confined to his home development from Palm\nE Dade State Atorney 7 \\\\| Manager Peter with a sick child thanked Re- Beach Atlantic University, al-\nney’s office for two reasons.

Epstein, 53, \"did solicit, induce,\n\n| entice or procure\" prostitution with girls, who were between l4 and l6 years old, on at\n\nleast three occasions between Aug. l, 2oo4, and Oct. 3l, 2oo5.\n\n|\n\n| Epstein surrendered at the Palm Beach County Jail Sunday and was released on a $3,ooo\n\n| bond. His atorney, Jack Goldberger, said Wednesday the third-\n\ndegree felony indictment is based on false accusations and that Epstein wasn't aware the\n\n| girls were minors.\nThe next step will be an arraignment at which Epstein will enter a plea and a trial date\nwill be set, but an arraignment has not yet been scheduled. Upon conviction, a third-\ndegree felony is punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,ooo fine.\nA resident of New York, Epstein has ouned a five-bedroom, 7,234-square-foot\nwaterfront home at 358 El Brillo Way since l99o.\nThe indictment folloued an ll-lmonth sexual batery investigation bo Tt Der ch sais\nthat began in March 2oo5 alter a Woiun told police tiai der L4-ycui-cis wie podusinci\nmay have been molested by a man in Palm Beach.\nThe investigation also focused on Epstcin's <span class=\"highlight\">assistant</span>, Sarah Kellen, 27, of New York\nCity, and on Haley Robson, 2o, of Royal Palm Beach, who police said were paid by\nEpstein to help facilitate the massages and sex. Robson found and transported the girls to\nEpstein's house for the massages in an upstairs bedroom, police said. Neither Kellen nor\nRobson has been indicted or arrested on any charge.\nPolice took sworn statements from five alleged victims and l7 witnesses concerning the\nmassages and alleged unlawful sexual activity.\nDuring their visits, the girls were introduced to Kellen, who took their names and phone\nnumbers, then sent them to Epstein's bedroom for massages and sexual contact, according\nto police.

She stated she went upstairs with Sarah while Epstein\ngot ready for the massage. He exited his bathroom naked and Radabaugh\nturned around.
