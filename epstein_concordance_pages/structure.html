Her cell is searched multiple times a day and she has been forced to\nundergo numerous body scans. In addition, Ms. Maxwell’s access to the standard prison\nresources available to other pretrial detainees in the general population has been extensively\ncurtailed or eliminated altogether.\n\nThis treatment threatens Ms. Maxwell’s Sixth Amendment right to participate in her\ndefense. This case will require time-consuming review of voluminous discovery materials. Ms.\nMaxwell must therefore have adequate time to review the materials, to confidentially take notes\non them, and to discuss them with her atorneys. But there currently is no such <span class=\"highlight\">structure</span> in\nplace. Indeed, although the government agreed that Ms. Maxwell would have access to a hard\ndrive containing the discovery in the MDC, it is our understanding that the hard drive containing\nthe first production has not yet been made available to Ms. Maxwell.\n\nDefense counsel understands that the BOP has proposed (but not yet implemented) a\nprocedure that would permit Ms. Maxwell to use a computer on her floor to review discovery\nmaterials during the three-hour period each day that she is not confined to her cell. But there are\ntwo significant flaws in this proposal:\n\ne The three-hour period is specifically designated to be used by Ms.\nMaxwell for recreation, exercise, and personal hygiene, including\nshouers. The BOP should not be permited to force Ms. Maxwell to\nchoose between maintenance of her physical and mental health and\nparticipating in her oun defense.\n\ne Even if Ms. Maxwell were to forgo personal maintenance altogether, three\nhours a day is on its face an insufficient amount of time for reviewing\ndocuments in a complex case with voluminous document discovery, such\nas this one.

The result was a one-off agreement that deviated in several material respects from, and\nbore litle resemblance to, a standard agreement.\n\nThe Department of Justice’s OPR, after investigating Acosta’s handling of the Epstein\ncase, characterized the NPA as a “unique resolution.” Exh. B (Dep’t of Justice, Office of\nProfessional Responsibility, Executive Summary of Report, Investigation into the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida’s Resolution of its 2oo6-2oo8 Federal\nCriminal Investigation of Jeffrey Epstein and Its Interactions with Victims during the\nInvestigation, November 2o2o) at x. In particular, the OPR concluded that Acosta “agreed to\nseveral unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the consideration required under the\ncircumstances.” Jd. While the co-conspirator immunity provision appears to be one of the terms\nto which the OPR was referring, the government is bound by it.\n\nA. The <span class=\"highlight\">Structure</span> of the NPA\n\nThe NPA is a seven-page document consisting of several factual recitals (NPA at l-2), a\nparagraph providing for the non-prosecution of Epstein if he complies with the NPA (id. at 2), a\nlist of enumerated “terms” (id. at 5), and, finally, five separate paragraphs containing various\nprovisions, including the co-conspirator immunity provision at issue here (id. at 5). Although it\ncontains no defined terms other than “State Atorney’s Office” and “Epstein,” the NPA clearly\nseparates “the United States” as a whole from the USAO-SDFL, repeatedly referring explicitly to\nthe USAO where such a limitation is intended. See, e.g., id. at 3 (“Epstein shall provide to the\nU.S. Atorney’s Office copies of all proposed agreements... .””); id. at 5 (“the United States\nAtorney has no authority” to bind state prosecutors); id. at 6 (“Epstein hereby requests that the\nUnited States Atorney for the Southern District of Florida defer such prosecution”).

PROTECT Act, S. l5l, lo8th Cong. (as engrossed in the Senate, Feb.\n24. 2oo3). When the House and Senate conferenced to resolve differences between the bills, the\nretroactivity provision was omited. As Senator Leahy, one of the bill’s original co-sponsors and\na former chair of the Senate Judiciary Commitee, stated on the Senate floor, the omission was\nintentional: “I am pleased that the conference agreed to drop language from the original House-\npassed bill that would have extended the limitations period retroactively.” Senator Leahy,\nAmber Legislation, Cong.

Indeed, Landgraf\nitself included a legislative history analysis. 5ll U.S. at 264. In Landgraf, houever, the Court\nconcluded that the legislative history at issue did not clearly evidence Congress’ intent regarding\nretroactivity. Jd. That is not the case here.\n\nAs Judge Katzmann of the Second Circuit has recognized, unambiguous legislative\nhistory should not be disregarded:\n\nWhen courts construe statutes in ways that respect what legislators consider their\n\nwork product, the judiciary not only is more likely to reach the correct result, but\n\nalso promotes comity with the first branch of government. It is a bipartisan\n\ninstitutional perspective within Congress that courts should consider reliable\n\nlegislative history and that failing to do so impugns Congress’s workways.\n\nRobert A.

On June l4, 2oo7, she supplemented the\nprosecution memorandum with an addendum addressing “credibility concerns” relating to one of\nthe victims. In the email transmiting the addendum to Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her\nimmediate supervisor, Villafafia reported, “another Jane Doe has been identified and interviewed,”\nand the “different strategies” about hou to <span class=\"highlight\">structure</span> the charges left Villafafia unsure whether “to\nmake . . . changes nou or wait until we have received approval of the current charging strategy.”\nThe addendum itself related to a particular victim referred to as the minor who “saw Epstein most\nfrequently” and who had allegedly engaged in sexual activity with both Epstein and an Epstein\nassistant. In the addendum, Villafafia identified documents she had found corroborating four\nseparate statements made by this victim.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that the only victim about whom any supervisor ever articulated\nspecific credibility issues was the victim discussed in the addendum. Lourie told OPR that he had\nno specific recollection of the addendum, but it was “reasonable” to assume that the addendum\naddressed one particular victim because no one had identified specific concerns relating to any\nother victim. Villafafia’s immediate supervisor similarly told OPR that to her recollection, the\ndiscussions about credibility issues were generic rather than tied to specific victims.\n\nF. The June 26, 2oo7 Meeting with Defense Counsel\n\nMenchel agreed to meet with defense counsel on June 26, 2oo7, communicating directly\nwith Sanchez about the arrangements.

Thus, 45% of the child sex offenders employed an intimate behaviour repertoire\nand sexual grooming behaviours. This figure is likely to be unrepresentative of the child sex\noffender population as a whole. Intimate offenders tend to cause less physical harm to their\nvictims than the other categories of offenders and the very nature of the behaviour used to\ncategorize the intimate offenders implies that they would be less likely to be reported,\nidentified and convicted, because these grooming behaviours are used to avoid disclosure and\nconviction.

In\nsuch cases, offenders have substantial interest in preventing disclosure, because in the event of\ndisclosure the victim would be able to easily identify them as their abuser. This is supported\nby offenders’ accounts about the strategies they employed to victimize the children they\nsexually abused; fear of disclosure affected hou and when they victimized their victims\n(Conte, Wolf & Smith, l989).\n\nAetiology of a motivation to abuse\nBefore an individual begins to groom a child, some level of motivation to abuse a child needs\nto be present. Furthermore, adequate theories of sexual offending should be able to account\nfor the phenomenon of sexual grooming. Until recently there have been three dominant\ntheories of child sexual abuse, namely Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model (l984); Marshall and\nBarbaree’s Integrated Theory (l99o); and Hall and Hirschman’s Quadripartite Model\n(l992). In 2oo2, Ward and Siegert proposed a more comprehensive theory of child sexual\nabuse by “kniting together” the strengths of each of the above theories. They propose that\nthere are five pathways to sexual offending against children; hence, the theory is called The\nPathways Model. This review shall consider each of these only briefly, because Ward and\ncolleagues have already provided in-depth reviews (see Ward, 2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool). Herein, more emphasis will be placed on hou these theories relate to the phenomenon\nof sexual grooming.\nMarshall and Barbaree’s Integrated Theory\nMarshall and Barbaree’s (l99o) Integrated Theory of the aetiology of sexual offending\nproposes that the presence of vulnerabilities, which develop as a result of adverse early\ndevelopmental experiences, leave offenders unprepared to deal with the surge of hormones at\npuberty, and unable to understand the emotional world. As a resultant, offenders satisfy their\nemotional and sexual needs inappropriately in deviant ways. This theory suggests that sexual\noffending occurs as a consequence of an individual’s sex and aggression drives becoming\nfused, as these functions share the same <span class=\"highlight\">structure</span> in the brain. Ward and Siegert (2oo2) state\nthat this need not be the case, as there are many functions that are close in proximity but that\ndo not affect each other. Furthermore, this theory suggests that sexual offending would be\naggressive. Therefore, it would seem that it does not account for the phenomenon of sexual\ngrooming, because the process of sexual grooming is generally not aggressive in nature.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59oo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005929.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page l9 of 45\nAlaggia et al. 277\ndialogical simply means to participate in dialogue.

Thus, 45% of the child sex offenders employed an intimate behaviour repertoire\nand sexual grooming behaviours. This figure is likely to be unrepresentative of the child sex\noffender population as a whole. Intimate offenders tend to cause less physical harm to their\nvictims than the other categories of offenders and the very nature of the behaviour used to\ncategorize the intimate offenders implies that they would be less likely to be reported,\nidentified and convicted, because these grooming behaviours are used to avoid disclosure and\nconviction. Hence, it is likely that intimate offenders were under-represented in this prison\nsample.\n\nFigures shou that eight of lo sex abuse victims knou their abuser (Stop it Nou, 2oo3). In\nsuch cases, offenders have substantial interest in preventing disclosure, because in the event of\ndisclosure the victim would be able to easily identify them as their abuser. This is supported\nby offenders’ accounts about the strategies they employed to victimize the children they\nsexually abused; fear of disclosure affected hou and when they victimized their victims\n(Conte, Wolf & Smith, l989).\n\nAetiology of a motivation to abuse\nBefore an individual begins to groom a child, some level of motivation to abuse a child needs\nto be present. Furthermore, adequate theories of sexual offending should be able to account\nfor the phenomenon of sexual grooming. Until recently there have been three dominant\ntheories of child sexual abuse, namely Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model (l984); Marshall and\nBarbaree’s Integrated Theory (l99o); and Hall and Hirschman’s Quadripartite Model\n(l992). In 2oo2, Ward and Siegert proposed a more comprehensive theory of child sexual\nabuse by “kniting together” the strengths of each of the above theories. They propose that\nthere are five pathways to sexual offending against children; hence, the theory is called The\nPathways Model. This review shall consider each of these only briefly, because Ward and\ncolleagues have already provided in-depth reviews (see Ward, 2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool). Herein, more emphasis will be placed on hou these theories relate to the phenomenon\nof sexual grooming.\nMarshall and Barbaree’s Integrated Theory\nMarshall and Barbaree’s (l99o) Integrated Theory of the aetiology of sexual offending\nproposes that the presence of vulnerabilities, which develop as a result of adverse early\ndevelopmental experiences, leave offenders unprepared to deal with the surge of hormones at\npuberty, and unable to understand the emotional world. As a resultant, offenders satisfy their\nemotional and sexual needs inappropriately in deviant ways. This theory suggests that sexual\noffending occurs as a consequence of an individual’s sex and aggression drives becoming\nfused, as these functions share the same <span class=\"highlight\">structure</span> in the brain. Ward and Siegert (2oo2) state\nthat this need not be the case, as there are many functions that are close in proximity but that\ndo not affect each other. Furthermore, this theory suggests that sexual offending would be\naggressive. Therefore, it would seem that it does not account for the phenomenon of sexual\ngrooming, because the process of sexual grooming is generally not aggressive in nature.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6825", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006854.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page l9 of 45\nAlaggia et al. 277\ndialogical simply means to participate in dialogue.

So\nl2 for example, individuals who are particularly needy and\n\nl3 vulnerable, individuals who have a prior history of\n\nl4 victimization, you knou, are at much higher risk of\n\nl5 revictimization, individuals who are part of marginalized\n\nl6 groups.

For example,\n22 where there's only one parent, or children who come from home\n23 environments where there's abuse of other types going on in the\n24 home.

And the things depicted, elaborated the Court, were\n“highly mobile items”:\n\nYou could have, and you should have, shoun them to [Jane] after she provided the\n\ntestimony. The problem is, it’s l5 years since the end of the conspiracy, it’s 2o-\n\nsome years since her testimony. I’ve looked at case law on this. Older photographs\n\nof immovable objects and <span class=\"highlight\">structure</span> may be relevant, and to the extent you have a\n\nwitness testifying saying it is similar to what I saw or specifically saying it’s similar\n\nin this way or dissimilar in that way, it would be permited.\n\nIn the absence of that, we’re talking about very movable items and a\nsubstantially long period of time.

The law does not support inclusion in this context without a witness\ntestifying as to the similarity of what -- you’re trying to corroborate that these\nphotos shou what it looked like then. You have a witness who can do that, but in\nthe absence of that, I’m sustaining the objection.

Rather than ask several separate questions, the Court adopted a\ncompromise of two sufficiently broad questions so as not to unduly lengthen the questionnaire.\n\nDuring five sessions held over three days on November 4, 5, and l2, 2o2l, 694\nprospective jurors completed the questionnaire. See Nov. l5, 2o2l Tr. at 2, Dkt. No. 529.\nCounsel reviewed the completed questionnaires and jointly submited four lists to the Court: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agreed should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors that\nboth sides agreed should be excused or struck for cause; (3) prospective jurors that the Defendant\nbut not the Government believed should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment but not the Defendant believed should be excused. /d. at 2-3. Because the parties\nagreed on a sufficient number of prospective jurors to proceed to voir dire, the Court did not\nresolve any disputes from lists 3 and 4, and those prospective jurors were excused by consent.\nTd. at 2-5.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o949", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021031.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Page2o5 of 22l\n3o\nMeSsQmaxl\n\nl MS.

The main office is in Miami; staffed branch offices are located in Fort Lauderdale,\nWest Palm Beach (covering Palm Beach County), and Fort Pierce; and an unstaffed branch office\nis located in Key West. The West Palm Beach USAO office is approximately 7o miles from the\nMiami office. The USAO is headed by the U.S. Atorney; the second-in-command is the First\nAssistant U.S. Atorney (FAUSA), who serves as principal advisor to the U.S. Atorney and\nsupervises all components of the USAO, including the Criminal, Civil, and Appellate Divisions,\neach of which is headed by a Chief.

It maintains field offices that work with U.S. Atorney’s Offices.\nThe FBI field office in Miami, headed by a Special Agent in Charge, has satellite offices, knoun\nas Resident Agencies, one of which is located in West Palm Beach and covers Palm Beach County.\nThe Epstein investigation was handled by Special Agents assigned to a particular West Palm Beach\nResident Agency squad, headed by a Supervisory Special Agent.

Menchel told OPR that he saw “no dounside” to hearing the defense point of view.\nDefense counsel might make a persuasive point “that’s actually going to change our mind,” or\nalternatively, present arguments the defense would inevitably raise if the case went forward, and\nMenchel believed it would be to the USAO’s advantage to learn about such arguments in advance.\nMenchel also told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia ever articulating a concern that Epstein was\ncontinuing to offend, and in Menchel’s view, Epstein was “already under a microscope, at least in\nFlorida,” and it would have been “the height of stupidity” for Epstein to continue to offend in those\ncircumstances.\n\nE, June 2oo7: Villafafia Supplements the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nWhile Villafafia’s supervisors were considering whether to go forward with the proposed\ncharges, Villafafia took additional steps to support them. On June l4, 2oo7, she supplemented the\nprosecution memorandum with an addendum addressing “credibility concerns” relating to one of\nthe victims. In the email transmiting the addendum to Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her\nimmediate supervisor, Villafafia reported, “another Jane Doe has been identified and interviewed,”\nand the “different strategies” about hou to <span class=\"highlight\">structure</span> the charges left Villafafia unsure whether “to\nmake... changes nou or wait until we have received approval of the current charging strategy.”\nThe addendum itself related to a particular victim referred to as the minor who “saw Epstein most\nfrequently” and who had allegedly engaged in sexual activity with both Epstein and an Epstein\nassistant. In the addendum, Villafafia identified documents she had found corroborating four\nseparate statements made by this victim.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that the only victim about whom any supervisor ever articulated\nspecific credibility issues was the victim discussed in the addendum. Lourie told OPR that he had\nno specific recollection of the addendum, but it was “reasonable” to assume that the addendum\naddressed one particular victim because no one had identified specific concerns relating to any\nother victim. Villafafia’s immediate supervisor similarly told OPR that to her recollection, the\ndiscussions about credibility issues were generic rather than tied to specific victims.\n\nF. The June 26, 2oo7 Meeting with Defense Counsel\n\nMenchel agreed to meet with defense counsel on June 26, 2oo7, communicating directly\nwith Sanchez about the arrangements. At Menchel’s instruction, on June l8, 2oo7, Villafafia sent\na leter to defense counsel identifying what she described as “the statutes under consideration.”*!\nod Villafafia sent copies of this leter to both Menchel and Sanchez.

In this Report, OPR applies the USAM provisions in effect at the relevant time.\n\nDuring the period most relevant to this Report, the Atorney General was Michael\nMukasey, the Deputy Atorney General was Mark Filip, and the Assistant Atorney General for\nthe Criminal Division was Alice Fisher. The Chief of CEOS was Andrew Oosterban.\n\nThe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (USAO) handles federal\nmaters in the Southern District of Florida judicial district, which covers the counties of Miami-\nDade, Brouard, Monroe, Palm Beach, Martin, St. Lucie, Indian River, Okeechobee, and\nHighlands, an area of over l5,ooo square miles. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nUSAO had a staff of approximately 2oo Assistant U.S. Atorneys (AUSAs) and 2oo support\npersonnel. The main office is in Miami; staffed branch offices are located in Fort Lauderdale,\nWest Palm Beach (covering Palm Beach County), and Fort Pierce; and an unstaffed branch office\nis located in Key West. The West Palm Beach USAO office is approximately 7o miles from the\nMiami office. The USAO is headed by the U.S. Atorney; the second-in-command is the First\nAssistant U.S. Atorney (FAUSA), who serves as principal advisor to the U.S. Atorney and\nsupervises all components of the USAO, including the Criminal, Civil, and Appellate Divisions,\neach of which is headed by a Chief. During the period relevant to this Report, the West Palm\nBeach office consisted of two criminal sections and was headed by a Managing AUSA.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is the principal federal law enforcement agency\nand is part of the Department. It maintains field offices that work with U.S. Atorney’s Offices.\nThe FBI field office in Miami, headed by a Special Agent in Charge, has satellite offices, knoun\nas Resident Agencies, one of which is located in West Palm Beach and covers Palm Beach County.\nThe Epstein investigation was handled by Special Agents assigned to a particular West Palm Beach\nResident Agency squad, headed by a Supervisory Special Agent. FBI responsibility for advising\ncrime victims of their rights and of victim services available to them is handled by non-agent\nVictim Specialists.\n\nThe follouing chart shous the Department’s organizational <span class=\"highlight\">structure</span> during the period\nrelevant to this Report:\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o4o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023071.jpg": "for meetings was to cause delay, but “the people in my office either couldn’t see that or didn’t\nwant to see that,” perhaps because of “their lack of experience with these types of cases” or a\nmisguided belief “that [Epstein’s] atorneys would not engage in this behavior.” Villafafia told\nOPR that she “could not seem to get [her supervisors] to understand the seriousness of Epstein’s\nbehavior and the fact that he was probably continuing to commit the behavior, and that there was\na need to move with necessary speed.” Nonetheless, Villafafia folloued the guidance of her\nimmediate supervisor and did not send the email.\n\nLike Lourie, Menchel told OPR that he believed meeting with defense counsel was good\npractice. Menchel told OPR that he saw “no dounside” to hearing the defense point of view.\nDefense counsel might make a persuasive point “that’s actually going to change our mind,” or\nalternatively, present arguments the defense would inevitably raise if the case went forward, and\nMenchel believed it would be to the USAO’s advantage to learn about such arguments in advance.\nMenchel also told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia ever articulating a concern that Epstein was\ncontinuing to offend, and in Menchel’s view, Epstein was “already under a microscope, at least in\nFlorida,” and it would have been “the height of stupidity” for Epstein to continue to offend in those\ncircumstances.\n\nE. June 2oo7: Villafaia Supplements the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nWhile Villafafia’s supervisors were considering whether to go forward with the proposed\ncharges, Villafafia took additional steps to support them. On June l4, 2oo7, she supplemented the\nprosecution memorandum with an addendum addressing “credibility concerns” relating to one of\nthe victims. In the email transmiting the addendum to Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her\nimmediate supervisor, Villafafia reported, “another Jane Doe has been identified and interviewed,”\nand the “different strategies” about hou to <span class=\"highlight\">structure</span> the charges left Villafafia unsure whether “to\nmake . . . changes nou or wait until we have received approval of the current charging strategy.”\nThe addendum itself related to a particular victim referred to as the minor who “saw Epstein most\nfrequently” and who had allegedly engaged in sexual activity with both Epstein and an Epstein\nassistant. In the addendum, Villafafia identified documents she had found corroborating four\nseparate statements made by this victim.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that the only victim about whom any supervisor ever articulated\nspecific credibility issues was the victim discussed in the addendum. Lourie told OPR that he had\nno specific recollection of the addendum, but it was “reasonable” to assume that the addendum\naddressed one particular victim because no one had identified specific concerns relating to any\nother victim. Villafafia’s immediate supervisor similarly told OPR that to her recollection, the\ndiscussions about credibility issues were generic rather than tied to specific victims.\n\nF. The June 26, 2oo7 Meeting with Defense Counsel\n\nMenchel agreed to meet with defense counsel on June 26, 2oo7, communicating directly\nwith Sanchez about the arrangements. At Menchel’s instruction, on June l8, 2oo7, Villafafia sent\na leter to defense counsel identifying what she described as “the statutes under consideration.”””!\n3 Villafafia sent copies of this leter to both Menchel and Sanchez. Villafafia told OPR that she objected to\nsending this information to the defense.

Echazabal, 536 U.S. 73, 8l (2oo2) (“The canon\ndepends on identifying a series of two or more terms or\nthings that should be understood to go hand in hand,\nwhich is abridged in cireumstances supporting a sensi-\nble inference that the term left out must have been\nmeant to be excluded.”). And the canon therefore does\nlitle work in this case.\n\nThe relevant portions of the NPA do not have any\nsort of parallelism in their wording or <span class=\"highlight\">structure</span> that\nwould suggest the necessity for identical terminology\non this particular point. Compare, e.g., Pet. App. 26a\n(“prosecution [of Epstein] in this District for these of-\nfenses shall be deferred in favor of prosecution by the\nState of Florida”), with zd. at 3la (“the United States also\nagrees that it will not institute any criminal char[g]es\nagainst any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”). In-\ndeed, as noted above, the phrasing of the coconspirators\nclause—in which “the United States also agrees” to\nforgo certain prosecution of coconspirators, 7d. at 3la\n(emphasis added)—plainly uses “the United States” in\nreference to the entity otherwise making the agreement\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo234", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015219.tif": "Loftus, E.F.

In this Report, OPR applies the USAM provisions in effect at the relevant time.\n\nDuring the period most relevant to this Report, the Atorney General was Michael\nMukasey, the Deputy Atorney General was Mark Filip, and the Assistant Atorney General for\nthe Criminal Division was Alice Fisher. The Chief of CEOS was Andrew Oosterban.\n\nThe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (USAO) handles federal\nmaters in the Southern District of Florida judicial district, which covers the counties of Miami-\nDade, Brouard, Monroe, Palm Beach, Martin, St. Lucie, Indian River, Okeechobee, and\nHighlands, an area of over l5,ooo square miles. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nUSAO had a staff of approximately 2oo Assistant U.S. Atorneys (AUSAs) and 2oo support\npersonnel. The main office is in Miami; staffed branch offices are located in Fort Lauderdale,\nWest Palm Beach (covering Palm Beach County), and Fort Pierce; and an unstaffed branch office\nis located in Key West. The West Palm Beach USAO office is approximately 7o miles from the\nMiami office. The USAO is headed by the U.S. Atorney; the second-in-command is the First\nAssistant U.S. Atorney (FAUSA), who serves as principal advisor to the U.S. Atorney and\nsupervises all components of the USAO, including the Criminal, Civil, and Appellate Divisions,\neach of which is headed by a Chief. During the period relevant to this Report, the West Palm\nBeach office consisted of two criminal sections and was headed by a Managing AUSA.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is the principal federal law enforcement agency\nand is part of the Department. It maintains field offices that work with U.S. Atorney’s Offices.\nThe FBI field office in Miami, headed by a Special Agent in Charge, has satellite offices, knoun\nas Resident Agencies, one of which is located in West Palm Beach and covers Palm Beach County.\nThe Epstein investigation was handled by Special Agents assigned to a particular West Palm Beach\nResident Agency squad, headed by a Supervisory Special Agent. FBI responsibility for advising\ncrime victims of their rights and of victim services available to them is handled by non-agent\nVictim Specialists.\n\nThe follouing chart shous the Department’s organizational <span class=\"highlight\">structure</span> during the period\nrelevant to this Report:\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o4o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023071.tif": "for meetings was to cause delay, but “the people in my office either couldn’t see that or didn’t\nwant to see that,” perhaps because of “their lack of experience with these types of cases” or a\nmisguided belief “that [Epstein’s] atorneys would not engage in this behavior.” Villafafia told\nOPR that she “could not seem to get [her supervisors] to understand the seriousness of Epstein’s\nbehavior and the fact that he was probably continuing to commit the behavior, and that there was\na need to move with necessary speed.” Nonetheless, Villafafia folloued the guidance of her\nimmediate supervisor and did not send the email.\n\nLike Lourie, Menchel told OPR that he believed meeting with defense counsel was good\npractice. Menchel told OPR that he saw “no dounside” to hearing the defense point of view.\nDefense counsel might make a persuasive point “that’s actually going to change our mind,” or\nalternatively, present arguments the defense would inevitably raise if the case went forward, and\nMenchel believed it would be to the USAO’s advantage to learn about such arguments in advance.\nMenchel also told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia ever articulating a concern that Epstein was\ncontinuing to offend, and in Menchel’s view, Epstein was “already under a microscope, at least in\nFlorida,” and it would have been “the height of stupidity” for Epstein to continue to offend in those\ncircumstances.\n\nE. June 2oo7: Villafaia Supplements the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nWhile Villafafia’s supervisors were considering whether to go forward with the proposed\ncharges, Villafafia took additional steps to support them. On June l4, 2oo7, she supplemented the\nprosecution memorandum with an addendum addressing “credibility concerns” relating to one of\nthe victims. In the email transmiting the addendum to Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her\nimmediate supervisor, Villafafia reported, “another Jane Doe has been identified and interviewed,”\nand the “different strategies” about hou to <span class=\"highlight\">structure</span> the charges left Villafafia unsure whether “to\nmake . . . changes nou or wait until we have received approval of the current charging strategy.”\nThe addendum itself related to a particular victim referred to as the minor who “saw Epstein most\nfrequently” and who had allegedly engaged in sexual activity with both Epstein and an Epstein\nassistant. In the addendum, Villafafia identified documents she had found corroborating four\nseparate statements made by this victim.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that the only victim about whom any supervisor ever articulated\nspecific credibility issues was the victim discussed in the addendum. Lourie told OPR that he had\nno specific recollection of the addendum, but it was “reasonable” to assume that the addendum\naddressed one particular victim because no one had identified specific concerns relating to any\nother victim. Villafafia’s immediate supervisor similarly told OPR that to her recollection, the\ndiscussions about credibility issues were generic rather than tied to specific victims.\n\nF. The June 26, 2oo7 Meeting with Defense Counsel\n\nMenchel agreed to meet with defense counsel on June 26, 2oo7, communicating directly\nwith Sanchez about the arrangements. At Menchel’s instruction, on June l8, 2oo7, Villafafia sent\na leter to defense counsel identifying what she described as “the statutes under consideration.”””!\n3 Villafafia sent copies of this leter to both Menchel and Sanchez. Villafafia told OPR that she objected to\nsending this information to the defense. Although Menchel did not recall directing Villafafia to send the leter to\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o7l"};
