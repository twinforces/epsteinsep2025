Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.*”” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . | was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\n\n222 Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big <span class=\"highlight\">Democratic</span> donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish.
