Mr. Epstein has\nscrupulously fulfilled his obligations in every jurisdiction in which he was required to register\nthroughout the lo-year hiatus between his release and present arrest. All of his travel has been\nmeticulously reported to the registration authorities so that they have been aware of his precise\nlocation every single day for the past lo years. Beter still, the pending charges date back l4-l7\nyears, from 2oo2 to 2oo5. Yet, tellingly, they allege no recurrence of the conduct underlying the\nNPA and Florida state conviction at any time in the ensuing decade and a half (2oo5-2ol9).\nTogether, these unique factors are pouerful indicia that Mr. Epstein is no longer a danger to\nanyone and will faithfully obey all conditions of release if ordered.\n\nIn sum, Mr. Epstein has substantial grounds to challenge the allegations charged by the\ngovernment in its indictment, and he has every intention of doing so in a lawful, professional,\nand principled manner. He intends to fight the current charges on their merits and, more, to\ncontest their legality given the inextricable intertwining of the current investigation and his NPA\nwhich promised him immunity and a global setlement for offenses including those brought\nunder l8 U.S.C. § l59l. Any perception that Mr. Epstein poses any conceivable danger or flight\nrisk may be readily dispelled by a slate of highly restrictive conditions, which amply suffice to\nsecure his release:\n\nl. Home detention in Mr. Epstein’s Manhatan residence, with permission to leave only for\nmedical appointments as approved by Pretrial Services, including (at the Court’s\ndiscretion) the <span class=\"highlight\">installation</span> of surveillance cameras at the front and rear entrances to\nensure compliance.\n\n2. Electronic monitoring with a Global Positioning System.”\n\n3. An agreement not to seek or obtain any new passport during the pendency of this mater.?\n> “A radio frequency (‘RF’) bracelet is the more conventional ‘ankle bracelet’ that has been used\nover time. GPS monitoring is a more recent phenomenon that is distinct from RF monitoring.\nWhile both units are placed on the ankle, the former tracks an offender’s movements in real time,\nwhile the later is contingent upon proximity to a base unit connected to a landline at an\noffender’s home. Statistically, GPS monitoring is more effective than RF monitoring at\npreventing recidivism.” United States v. Paulino, 335 F. Supp. 3d 6oo, 6l7 n.5 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8)\n(citations omited).\n\n3 Mr. Epstein has only one active passport permiting current travel — not three, as the\ngovernment fancies.

The secure\nInternet connection will enable the trial teams in the courtroom to stay connected to their\nonline case repositories and resources during critical moments of the proceedings. This\nwill facilitate the effective and efficient presentation of evidence. In addition, the parties\nwill be able to reduce the files they bring into the courtroom, as well as the traffic to and\nfrom the courtroom during proceedings. Although the parties understand that the\ncourtroom also has Wi-Fi access, which is available for use, a high-speed wired connection\nensures a faster internet connection and will avoid connectivity issues.\n\nSubject to the Court’s approval, the parties will retain Courtroom Connect to\nprovide these services. Courtroom Connect does not require any court resources to provide\nservice and currently maintains a network in the courthouse that is loo% independent of\nthe Court’s internal network. Set up, <span class=\"highlight\">installation</span> and service fees will be paid for by the\nparties at no cost to the Court.\n\nOther trials in federal courts have utilized a high-speed connection to the Internet\nin the courtroom, including United States v.

The follouing\ndescribes hou Courtroom Connect restricts access to the network and ensures compliance\nwith court security and directives:\n\n¢ The network will be a hard-wired, secure physical network connection\nutilizing a firewall and other security provisions.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7354\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023449.jpg": "The Electronics Technician told the OIG that, throughout his tenure at MCC New York, the camera system\nwas subject to frequently recurring failures, particularly with respect to the DVR hard drives.”\nThe Warden, who assumed his responsibilities at MCC New York in May 2ol8, told the OIG he was generally\naware that there were problems with the security camera system throughout the institution. He further\nstated that efforts were undertaken to determine which cameras were working and which needed to be\nfixed, and that MCC New York officials intended to ultimately seek funding to replace the entire system.\nFederal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) records reflect that on September 6, 2ol8, the Warden submited a\nmemorandum to the BOP’s Northeast Regional Director to request $8oo,ooo in funding to replace the entire\ncamera system. The memorandum identified an estimated project start date of December l, 2ol8, and an\nestimated completion date of February 9, 2ol9. The BOP approved the funding request, and on\nSeptember 2l, 2ol8, a contract in the amount of $698,lo8.99 was awarded to Company l to provide various\nequipment for the project and associated labor. On September 24, 2ol8, a separate contract in the amount\nof $34,o89.28 was awarded to Company 2 to provide assorted networking equipment and wiring needed to\ninstall the camera system.\nAs the camera upgrade project was beginning, BOP officials recognized that MCC New York’s mechanical,\nelectrical, and plumbing systems were also in need of major repairs. MCC New York did not have enough\nqualified technicians on staff to complete both the camera <span class=\"highlight\">installation</span> and other repairs needed at the\nfacility, so beginning the week of March l7, 2ol9, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office arranged for\ntechnicians from other BOP institutions to conduct temporary duty (TDY) assignments at MCC New York to\nperform the work. During the course of the TDY rotations, work was not consistently conducted on the\ncamera upgrade because sometimes TDY staff assigned to the project were used to cover shortages at MCC\nNew York's custody posts, and sometimes there were not enough TDY volunteers who possessed the skills\nrequired to do the camera work.\nAt the time of Epstein’s death on August lo, 2ol9, the camera system upgrade had not been completed.\nImmediately follouing Epstein’s death, Company l officials arrived at MCC New York and installed the new\nrecording system within a couple of days, and recording functionality was restored using the existing\ncameras. The majority of the new cameras did not arrive at the facility until October 2ol9, and they were\ninstalled in stages as the wiring work was conducted. According to the Electronics Technician, as of\nAugust 2o2l, when the MCC closed, the wiring work had still not been fully completed.\nll. Discovery of Security Camera System Recording Issues in August 2ol9\nA. Discovery on August 8 of the DVR 2 Failure that Occurred on July 29\nAccording to forensic analysis conducted by the FBI after Epstein’s death, disk failures occurred in MCC\nNew York's DVR 2 system on July 29, 2ol9, which resulted in the system being unable to record. According\nto BOP records and OIG interviews, the BOP did not learn about the failure until August 8, 2ol9, when the\nSpecial Investigative Services (SIS) Lieutenant and Associate Warden l atempted to review recorded\nsurveillance video for a mater unrelated to Epstein. The SIS Lieutenant told the OIG she discovered that no\n* The Electronics Technician provided the OIG with copies of email messages and work orders that documented nine\ninstances between June 2ol7 and July 2ol9, in which actions were taken to address a problem with either the MCC\nNew York's cameras or the hard drives used to record video from the cameras.\n82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23449\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023476.jpg": "TRUSCOPE, but that it was primarily the SHU Officer in Charge’s responsibility to do so. The Evening Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he and other staff members did not conduct any cell searches\nduring his shift in the SHU on August 9. Additionally, the OIG determined that there was an excessive\namount of bed linen within Epstein’s cell. The Captain reviewed photographs of Epstein’s cell and told the\nOIG that the excessive linens were a security issue because they could give inmates materials to fashion an\nimprovised noose or use as escape paraphernalia.\nThe OIG found that on August 9, 2ol9, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge either failed to conduct the\nrequired cell searches or failed to document the cell searches that he conducted in the SHU, and that the\nEvening Watch SHU Officer in Charge failed to ensure that MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU\nconducted cell searches and himself failed to log cell searches in violation of BOP policy and MCC New York\nSHU Post Orders. Additionally, the OIG found that it was a performance failure for the Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, and Noel, who served as the SHU Officer in\nCharge during their respective shifts on August 9 and lo, 2ol9, to have permited Epstein to have an\nexcessive amount of linens in his cell.\n\nE. MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that the Institution’s Security Camera\n\nSystem was Fully Functional Resulting in Limited Recorded Video Evidence\nThis investigation and review revealed longstanding deficiencies with MCC New York's security camera\nsystem. These deficiencies resulted in nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU where Epstein was\nbeing housed to not record video starting in late July 2ol9 and continuing through the date of Epstein’s\ndeath on August lo, 2ol9. According to forensic analysis conducted by the FBI after Epstein’s death, on\nJuly 29, 2ol9, a disk failure in MCC New York's DVR 2 system caused approximately half of the institution's\ncameras—including nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU—to display only a live video feed with\nno video recording. MCC New York personnel did not learn of this system failure until ll days later on\nAugust 8, 2ol9. MCC New York personnel determined that the DVR 2 system needed to be rebuilt to restore\nrecording functionality. Despite the lack of recording functionality, this repair was not completed until after\nEpstein’s death.\nThe Warden told the OIG that he was generally aware that there were problems with the camera system.\nThe Warden sought and received approval from BOP to replace the entire camera system and in\nSeptember 2ol8, BOP entered into contracts totaling over $73o,ooo to purchase new equipment for the\ncamera replacement project. Although MCC New York management procured new DVR components\napproximately 9 months prior to Epstein’s death, the new system was not installed in a timely manner. The\nnew cameras required new conduit and wiring to be installed before the camera <span class=\"highlight\">installation</span>. Management\nfaced staffing shortages, temporary rotating facility managers, and other competing priorities that did not\nallou for completion of the <span class=\"highlight\">installation</span> of the wiring or the new camera system.

(See probable cause\naffidavit at page l8). In particular, the probable cause affidavit notes that “on\nthe first floor of the Epstein residence . . . [was] found two covert cameras\nhidden in clocks. One was located in the garage and the other located in the\nlibrary area behind Epstein’s computer. . . . the computer’s hard drive was\nreviewed which shoued several images of [J and other witnesses\ninterviewed. All of these images appeared to come from the camera\npositioned behind Epstein’s desk”. (/d.) Omited from the Police Report and\nthe probable cause affidavit is the fact that the PBPD had knoun since 2oo3\nabout the presence of the cameras, and the specific reason for their <span class=\"highlight\">installation</span>.\nThe cameras were installed in 2oo3 after Epstein discovered that large sums of\ncash were missing from his home. Indeed, not only were the cameras\ninstalled at the suggestion of the PBPD, but the PBPD initially provided\nequipment that did not work and thereafter assisted in the <span class=\"highlight\">installation</span> of the\nequipment Epstein purchased. The cameras ultimately served their purpose\nand captured the image of former employee Juan Alessi, removing cash from\nEpstein’s briefcase after unlawfully entering the house. The recording of\nAlessi was turned over to the PBPD — indeed, to Det. Recarey himself. The\ncharacterization of the video equipment either as a surprise to the PBPD or as\nplaying a part in the alleged sexual activity in Epstein’s home (even though\nnone of the complainants ever made any mention of such equipment, or ever\nplaced any activity in the locations of the cameras), is false and misleading\nand suggests an intention to portray the facts to suit a particular goal.\n\n4. Broken “Sex Toys” in Epstein’s Trash. The Police Report details police\nfinding in Epstein’s trash what is described as pieces of “sex toys” and that\nthese “discoveries” purportedly corroborate witness statements. Omited from\nboth the Police Report and the probable cause affidavit is the fact that during\nthe course of executing the search warrant on Epstein’s home, the police\nrealized that a key “sex toy” was in fact the broken handle of a salad server.\nThough the “sex toys” play a prominent role in the Police Report and probable\ncause affidavit, the Police Report was never amended to reflect the discovery\nof this new and highly relevant evidence.\n\n5. Failure to Consider Exculpatory or Impeaching Evidence. Other\nexculpatory and impeaching evidence knoun by the PBPD was omited from\nthe Police Report and probable cause affidavit by, in our view, manipulating\nthe date the investigation was allegedly closed. According to the Police\nReport (at page 85), Det. Recarey “explained [to ASA Belohlavek] that the\nPBPD had concluded its case in December of 2oo5”. That assertion, which is\nfalse, conveniently resulted in the omission of all information adduced\nsubsequent to that date. Thus, though the Police Report in fact contains\ninformation obtained after December 2oo5, the PBPD escaped having to\nconsider, or even to include in the Police Report, the probable cause affidavit,\nor what it released to the public, all the exculpatory and impeaching evidence\npresented on behalf of Epstein, most of which was provided after December\n2oo5. That evidence is listed belou.\n\n3 Public Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo332lo\n"};
