In my view, a public hearing\n\n2 clearly is nevertheless the preferred vehicle for its\n\n3 resolution.\n\n4 Incidentally, while I'm on this subject, I got some\n\n5 help today from the New York Law Journal from two professors\n\n6 who write that a hearing is -- let me tell you exactly what\n\n7 they said. They say, in part, that this is an odd moment for\n\n8 transparency in a criminal case. I think that is an odd\n\n9 sentence to hear about, transparency in a criminal case.\n\nlo They go on to say that normally, if a prosecutor seeks\nll to dismiss an indictment for such an obviously worthy reason,\nl2 the court would simply grant the request. As to that\n\nl3 statement, I respectfully say it is incorrect as a mater of\n\nl4 law.\n\nl5 They go on to say the judge would not schedule a\n\nl6 hearing and he definitely would not allou the victims to speak.\nl7 If he did hold a hearing, whatever <span class=\"highlight\">informational</span> interests the\nl8 victims may have would be served by affording them a chance to\nl9 atend the hearing, not by giving them a speaking role.\n2o I read it. It was incredulous. I'm still\n2l incredulous. I don't quite understand at all. There is a\n22 suggestion in the article that the reason they are making these\n23 suggestions has to do with minimization of drama in this case.\n24 In the Jeffrey Epstein case, there has not been much a\n25 minimization of drama, and what litle drama might happen\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo642", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000728.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB.
