Jeffrey Epstein, Criminal No. l9-49o\nDear Judge Berman:\n\nWe write to outline the grounds entitling Jeffrey Epstein to pretrial release, proposing a\nstringent set of conditions that will effectively <span class=\"highlight\">guarantee</span> his appearance and abate any\nconceivable danger he’s claimed to present.\n\nIn essence, the government seeks to remand a self-made New York native and lifelong\nAmerican resident based on dated allegations for which he was already convicted and punished —\nconduct the relitigation of which is barred by a prior federal nonprosecution agreement (the\n“NPA”). The government makes this drastic demand even though Mr. Epstein has never once\natempted to flee the United States — despite a Florida federal judge’s stated belief that he could\nvoid the NPA in appropriate circumstances, possibly threatening new charges there, and\nnotwithstanding legally erroneous government assertions in ancillary litigation that Mr. Epstein\nwas subject to potential prosecution in other federal judicial districts, including this one\nspecifically. Indeed, Mr. Epstein feared the toxic political climate might tempt the government to\ntry and end-run the NPA -— yet continually returned home from travel abroad, fully prepared to\nvindicate his rights under the agreement and otherwise mount a full-throated defense. Finally,\nthe government takes its extreme position in the teeth of Mr. Epstein’s perfect compliance with\nonerous sex offender registration requirements — pinpointing his exact nightly whereabouts —\nacross multiple jurisdictions over a lo-year period.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo274\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000278.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 Filed o7/ll/l9 Page 5 of l6\n\nThough the Bail Reform Act contains a rebutable presumption in favor of detention\nbased on the crimes charged, the presumption shifts only the burden of production, not\npersuasion. See United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll44 (2d Cir. l986). Accordingly, the\nstatutory demand on defendants “‘is fairly easily met.” United States v. Conway, No. 4-ll-7o756,\n2oll WL 342l32l, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 3, 2oll). To rebut the presumption, a defendant need\nonly “shou that the specific nature of the crimes charged, or that something about their\nindividual circumstances, suggests that ‘what is true in general is not true in the particular\ncase...” United States v. Dominguez, 783 F.2d 7o2, 7o7 (7th Cir. l986) (quoting United States\nv. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378, 384 (lst Cir.l985)). “The quantum of evidence required to rebut the\npresumption is not high.” United States v. Thompson, No. l6-CR-oool9, 2ol8 WL 44733l, at *2\n(M.D. Pa. Jan. l7, 2ol8) (citation omited). “Any evidence favorable to a defendant that comes\nwithin a category listed in § 3l42(g) can affect the operation of [the presumption], including\nevidence of their marital, family and employment status, ties to and role in the community, clean\ncriminal record and other types of evidence encompassed in § 3l42(g)(3).” Dominguez, 783 F.2d\nat 7o7 (clean record plus socioeconomic stability sufficed to rebut presumption).\n\nIn short, evidence that the defendant is unlikely to flee or commit crimes rebuts the\npresumption, forcing the government to persuade the court that detention is warranted. See\nConway, 2oll WL 342l32l, at *5 (§ l59l defendant released pending trial). While not\ndisappearing entirely, the presumption thus recedes to one factor among many in determining\nwhether there are sufficient conditions to “reasonably assure” both presence and safety. See\nMartir, 782 F.2d at ll44; see also United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 89l (8th Cir. l985)\n(“[R]easonably assure” doesn’t mean “<span class=\"highlight\">guarantee</span>.”). Even in a presumption case, then, “the\ngovernment retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence that the\ndefendant presents a danger to the community,” and by a “preponderance” that he poses a flight\n“tisk.” United States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (citation and internal quotation\nmarks omited).\n\nI. Mr. Epstein’s l4-year record of law-abiding behavior rebuts any presumption in\nfavor of pretrial detention\n\nIn this case, any danger presumption atending the § l59l charges evaporates against Mr.\nEpstein’s meticulous obedience, from 2oo5 to date, to both the law’s commands and his rigorous\nregistration and reporting obligations as a convicted sex offender. The indictment does not allege\nthat Mr. Epstein commited any crime in the l4-year interval between the end of the alleged\nconduct and the initiation of this case. The dangerousness prong of the Bail Reform Act is\npredictive, asking whether it’s likely that Mr. Epstein will reoffend if released. A spotless l4-\nyear record of walking the straight and narrou, complemented by an exemplary lo-year history\nof diligent sex offender registration and reporting, is compelling proof he was able, once the\nprior investigation commenced, to conform his conduct to the law’s dictates. The time lag\nbetween the offenses charged and today is particularly compelling in terms of a prediction of\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo278\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000282.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 - Filed o7/ll/l9 Page 9 of l6\nFinally, the government fails to consider the doctrine of pre-indictment delay, inasmuch\n\nas the statute of limitations does not fully define a defendant’s rights with respect to delays that\noccurred prior to the indictment. See generally United States v. Marion, 4o4 U.S. 3o7 (l97l).\nHere, the delays of l4 years from the last alleged act and l2 years since Mr. Epstein signed the\nNPA are extraordinary. If the government is correct that the NPA does not, and never did,\npreclude a prosecution in this district, then the government will have to explain why it\npurposefully delayed a prosecution of someone like Mr. Epstein, who registered as a sex\noffender lo years ago and was certainly no stranger to law enforcement. There is no legitimate\nexplanation for the delay.\nIl. The government fails to meet its burden of proving that no combination of\n\nconditions will assure Mr. Epstein’s appearance and public safety\n\nAn analysis of the relevant statutory factors and case law supports pretrial release. Even\nshould the Court conclude, despite substantial evidence to the contrary, that the defendant\npresents a risk of flight, the foregoing combination of conditions virtually guarantees his\nappearance as required. Crucially, while it is always possible to hypothesize risks, the statutory\nstandard requires only a reasonable assurance that the defendant, if released, will appear. The\nconditions proposed above, including electronic GPS monitoring, surrender of Mr. Epstein’s\npassport, deregistration and/or grounding of Mr. Epstein’s private plane, and a substantial\npersonal bond (including posting of personal residence(s) and/or private jet as security to\n<span class=\"highlight\">guarantee</span> appearance) would extinguish any plausible risks. Mr. Epstein’s current notoriety\nminimizes any conceivable risk of flight even further. The location where he could be detained —\nhis residence on East 7l‘ Street in New York has entrances (one on the street, one in the back)\nthat can be easily monitored by video. With all of his financial resources in the United States\n(other than his Paris residence) and with his New York residence at risk due to the government’s\nforfeiture allegation, Mr. Epstein would be sacrificing virtually everything he has worked for —\nincluding any collateral the Court requires he post to secure his appearance — if he were to flee\nand to disentitle himself to the defense of his property whether it would be at risk to forfeiture or\nfor a bail violation.\n\nTo the extent there is any doubt regarding the proposed conditions, there is tremendous\nmoral suasion provided by the posting of real and personal property of Mr. Epstein’s brother, and\nhis close personal friend of decades, who have offered to co-sign a surety bond to ensure Mr.\nEpstein’s appearance in Court as required. Indeed, Mr. Epstein’s brother has agreed to pledge\nhis family home, that he shares half the year with his l4-year-old daughter and l7-year-old son,\nin order to secure the bond. It is particularly telling that Mr. Epstein’s brother, his only living\nimmediate family member, as well as his close personal friend, are both willing to <span class=\"highlight\">guarantee</span> his\nappearance, notwithstanding the widespread negative publicity of Mr. Epstein that has\ndominated the news cycle since his arrest.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo282\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000283.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 - Filed o7/ll/l9 Page lo of l6\n\nTo reiterate, the Bail Reform Act requires pretrial release on the “/east restrictive”\nconditions that will assure both appearance and public safety. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)\n(emphasis added). Home confinement monitored by 24-hour private security guards — a lesser\nrestriction than pretrial detention — has proven effective in meeting those goals in many\nprominent cases prosecuted in our Circuit, including cases against defendants as infamous as\nBernie Madoff, Mare Dreier and David Brooks.\n\nTo be clear, defense counsel are fully confident Mr. Epstein will appear as required\nwithout resort to this measure. And we understand and appreciate Your Honor’s opposition to it.\nSee United States v. Zarrab, No. l5-CR-867, 2ol6 WL 368l423 (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6). Still,\nMr. Epstein stands ready and willing to pay for 24-hour armed guards should the Court deem it\nnecessary or appropriate.\n\nMore precisely, we realize that Your Honor objects to the measure as more akin to\ncustody than release, finding it inequitable for wealthier defendants to “buy their way out” of jail\npending trial. Jd. at *2, *9-lo, *l3 (citation omited). Nonetheless, a band of other courts in our\narea have endorsed the procedure,’ and the Second Circuit has affirmed its use.*\n\nFor reasons explained elsewhere, round-the-clock, privately funded security guards will\nvirtually <span class=\"highlight\">guarantee</span> — not just reasonably assure — Mr. Epstein’s presence in the circumstances of\nthis case. Accordingly, and given the division of authority surrounding the practice, we\nrespectfully propose it here as a fallback, asking the Court to revisit its propriety despite the\nreservations expressed in Zarrab. Those reservations, though admirably motivated and sincerely\nheld, raise substantial equal protection concerns. They impair the statutory right to release on the\nleast restrictive conditions in the circumstances presented — an inherently individualized\ndetermination — based largely on socioeconomic status, a suspect if not invidious classification.\nAvoiding “inequity and unequal treatment” rooted in such dubious socioeconomic distinctions —\ndoing “equal right to the poor” and “rich” alike — are imperatives that run both ways. /d.

See, e.g., DE 99 at 6 (recognizing that the relief Petitioners seek “is to\ninvalidate the non-prosecution agreement”). But even assuming arguendo that Petitioners’ rights\nunder the CVRA were violated when Epstein and the USAO-SDFL entered into the Non-\nProsecution Agreement, constitutional due process guarantees do not allou either the Non-\nProsecution Agreement — which by its terms induced Epstein to, inter alia, plead guilty to state\ncriminal charges and serve an l8-month sentence of state incarceration’ — or the governmental\nthis Court need not reach or address those issues because an analysis of the third prong of the\nstanding test incontrovertibly establishes the Petitioners’ lack of standing.

Co-Signers, Moral Suasion, and Ties to the Community\n\nThe dearth of detailed financial information about the defendant himself, much less his\nbrother or friend, further shous the hollouness of the proposal. The Court cannot possibly\nevaluate whether there would be any incentive whatsoever for those the two proposed co-signers\nto exercise moral suasion over the defendant—or whether, as noted above, the defendant could\neasily compensate them, perhaps many times over, for any loss they incurred through the\ndefendant’s flight from justice. The defendant provides no information about his brother other\nthan that he lives half the year in the home he purportedly would pledge, and even less information\nabout Mr. Mitchell, other than that he is “Mr. Epstein’s friend,” his “close personal friend of\ndecades,” and his “close personal friend.” Release Motion at 4, 9. Their willingness to “<span class=\"highlight\">guarantee</span>”\nhis appearance, Release Motion at 9, is meaningless in the absence of such information.\n\nMoreover, the notion that any individual co-signer could meaningfully secure a bond for\nthis defendant strains credulity. Given the defendant’s wealth and his extraordinary risk of flight,\nany bond for this defendant would assuredly have to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars to\neven be claimed to be sufficient to guard against the risks posed by the defendant’s release. The\ndefendant offers no reason to believe any co-signers could meaningfully sign such a bond, much\nless these two particular individuals, which is yet another reason the proposed package is patently\ninsufficient.\n\n3. The Defendant’s “Consent” to Extradition is Unenforceable and Impractical\n\nThe defendant’s offer to sign a so-called “consent” to extradition provides no additional\nreassurance whatsoever. As an initial mater, the Government would need to find and re-arrest the\ndefendant before such a waiver would even come into play. Moreover, even assuming the\nGovernment could locate and apprehend the defendant, numerous courts have recognized that such\npurported waivers are unenforceable and effectively meaningless because any defendant who signs\nsuch a purported waiver and then flees will assuredly contest the validity and/or voluntariness of\nthe waiver, and will get to do so in the jurisdiction of his choosing (i.e., the one to which he chose\nto flee). See, e.g., United States v. Morrison, No. l6-MR-ll8, 2ol6 WL 742l924, at *4 (W.D.N.Y.\nDec. 23, 2ol6); United States v. Kazeem, No. l5 Cr. l72, 2ol5 WL 4645357, at *3 (D. Or.

The Department of Justice’s Office of\nInternational Affairs is unaware of any country anywhere in the world that would consider an\nanticipatory extradition waiver binding. And, of course, the defendant could choose to flee to a\njurisdiction with which the United States does not have an extradition treaty.\n\nBeyond being impossible to <span class=\"highlight\">guarantee</span>, extradition is typically a lengthy, complicated and\nexpensive process, and the possibility that it would be successful neither provides any real\ndeterrent to the defendant’s incentive to flee nor any measure of justice to the victims who would\nbe required to wait years for his return.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo335\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000403.jpg": "CTaseceb9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentl8 Filed o7/l6/l9 Pagel7 of l8 l7\n\nl order.

In that vein, we write to address the\nDepartment of Justice’s request to unseal grand jury materials and to respectfully urge the Court to\nadminister any disclosure in a manner that fully honors the victims’ rights under the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (““CVRA”), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, the enduring interests protected by Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 6(e), and Eleventh Circuit precedent.\nI.

U.S. Dist. Court, 435 F.3d loll, lol6-l7 (9th Cir. 2oo6) (fairness and dignity are\nsubstantive, enforceable rights); Jn re Dean, 527 F.3d 39l, 394-95 (5th Cir. 2oo8) (government must\nconfer with victims before making consequential case decisions); Jn re Wild, 994 F.3d l244 (llth\nCir. 2o2l) (en banc) (confirming that CVRA protections are fully atached post-conviction).\nGiven our history fighting for the enforcement of the CVRA on behalf of Jeffrey Epstein’s many\nvictims, we were quite surprised to learn that the government sought the unsealing of grand jury\nmaterials before this Court without first conferring with the victims or their counsel, a step required\nby the CVRA and reinforced by Doe v. United States, o8-8o736 (S.D. Fla.). That case, litigated pro\nbono by undersigned counsel for more than a decade, arose precisely because the government\npreviously violated the rights of many of these very same victims. It is especially troubling that,\ndespite the outcome of that litigation, the government has once again proceeded in a manner that\ndisregards the victims’ rights—suggesting that the hard-learned lessons of the past have not taken\nhold. This omission reinforces the perception that the victims are, at best, an afterthought to the\ncurrent administration.\nOf significant concern, the same government that failed to provide notice to the victims before\nmoving this Court to unseal the grand jury materials is nou the government representing to this Court\nthat it has provided appropriate notice to the victims or their counsel and has conducted a proper\nreview and redaction of the materials it seeks to release. Several clients have contacted us expressing\ndeep anxiety over whether the redactions were in fact adequate. Consequently, we requested\nyesterday that the government identify which of our clients were referenced to the grand jury. The\ngovernment responded promptly and provided clarification. Houever, we have strong reason to\nbelieve that additional individuals-—whom we also represent—were likely referenced in those\nmaterials but were not identified to us by the government.\nIt remains unclear whether notice was instead provided to prior counsel, whether their omission was\na government oversight, whether the government does not consider them to be victims, or whether\nthese individuals were, in fact, not mentioned to the grand jury. Regardless of the explanation, this\nambiguity raises a serious issue that must be resolved before any materials are publicly released.\nAgainst this backdrop, any disclosure of grand jury material—especially material that could expose\nor help identify victims in any way—directly affects the CVRA’s fairness, privacy, conferral, and\nprotection guarantees. To ensure those rights are protected, it is essential that the protocol outlined\nin the relief requested belou is adopted by this Court.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo772\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000787.jpg": "Cas@’4Sfol4-4648o-RMB DbeuMenPsh Piles OY lSuisagsdya 4OF 33 |\nDefense proposes what they describe as “‘a stringent set of [l4] conditions that will effectively |\n<span class=\"highlight\">guarantee</span> [Mr. Epstein’s] appearance and abate any conceivable danger he’s claimed to present.” |\nId. at l.

The\n24 government's allegation is that the person who is aware of a\n25 criminal investigation in the United States, has her counsel in\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooolo6l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001137.jpg": "Cased 2o-€FQd3GouAUNt DibeuMe/ntl $7o 2Fil ed 42SBM/ 26a cedg@s 4l 2o45\nll-l2). Ms. Maxwell is not obligated to rebut every theoretical possibility that the government\nmight raise that may contribute to a potential flight risk in order to be granted bail. That is not\nthe standard. Cf United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 888 n.4, 892-93 (8th Cir. l985) (“The\nlegal standard required by the |Bail Reform] Act is one of reasonable assurances, not absolute\nguarantees.”). Ms. Maxwell has no intention of fleeing. If she did, then under the proposed bail\nconditions she would lose everything and destroy the family she has been fighting so hard to\nprotect since Epstein’s arrest. Ms. Maxwell will not do that, and should be granted bail.\n\nG. The Alternative to Bail Is Confinement Under Oppressive Conditions\n\nthat Impact Ms. Maxwell’s Health and Ability to Prepare Her Defense\n\nGranting bail to Ms. Maxwell is all the more appropriate and necessary because the past\nfew months have shoun that Ms. Maxwell cannot adequately participate in her defense and\nprepare for trial from the inside the MDC. The alternative to release is her continued\nconfinement under extraordinarily onerous conditions that are not only unjust and punitive, but\nalso meaningfully impair Ms. Maxwell’s ability to review the voluminous discovery produced by\nthe government and to communicate effectively with counsel to prepare her defense.\n\nMs. Maxwell has spent the entirety of her detention nou over five months in de facto\nsolitary confinement, under conditions that rival those used at USP Florence ADMAX to\nsupervise the most dangerous inmates in the federal system and are tantamount to imprisonment\nas a defendant convicted of capital murder and incarcerated on death rou. In fact, multiple\nwardens and interim wardens have remarked that in their collective years of experience they\nhave never seen anything like her current regime. The restrictive regulations to which Ms.\nMaxwell is subjected are not reasonably related to a legitimate goal to ensure the security of Ms.\nMaxwell or the MDC. Instead, it seems clear that the overly restrictive conditions are an\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll37\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001164.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAIN n DUE Gmeholooo 7A ile@ 425o8) 26a deageck A Ob 36\nto authorities in the United States would not be binding in the United Kingdom, and the defendant\ncould easily decide not to consent to extradition once found abroad.\n\nFurther, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on extradition\nbased on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the passage of\ntime, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition. See, e.g., id. at\n§§ 82, 83A, & 9l. Even if a final order of extradition has been entered by a court, the Secretary\nof State still has the discretion to deny extradition. See id. at § 93. The Government understands\nfrom OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently extensively litigated, uncertain,\nand subject to multiple levels of appeal. Moreover, even where the process is ultimately\nsuccessful, it is lengthy and time-consuming.\n\nUltimately, although the defendant purports to be willing to waive her right to challenge\nbeing extradited to the United States, she simply cannot do so under the laws of France and the\nUnited Kingdom, and she would be free to fight extradition once in those countries. And, of\ncourse, the defendant could choose to flee to another jurisdiction altogether, including one with\nwhich the United States does not have an extradition treaty. The defendant’s writen waivers of\nextradition from France and the United Kingdom certainly provide no <span class=\"highlight\">guarantee</span> that the defendant\nwill not flee to a third country from which, even if she can be located, extradition may be\nimpossible. Courts have recognized that lack of an effective means of extradition can increase a\ndefendant’s flight risk, and have cited such facts as a relevant consideration in detaining defendants\npending trial. See, e.g., United States v. Namer, 238 F.3d 425, 2ooo WL l872ol2, at *2 (6th Cir.\nDec. l2, 2ooo); Cilins, 2ol3 WL 38o2ol2 at *2; United States v. Abdullahu, 488 F. Supp. 2d 433,\n443 (D.N.J. 2oo7) (“The inability to extradite defendant should he flee weighs in favor of\ndetention.”).

On this renewed application, Ms. Maxwell has put\nbefore the Court a significant bail package, supported by detailed submissions, which warrant\nher release on strict conditions. She and her spouse have commited to signing a bond in the full\namount of their net worth, regardless of the ounership of the underlying assets. She has\nproffered seven additional sureties, consisting of her family and close friends, many of whom are\nUS. citizens and long-time residents, who have come forward at great personal risk and have\npledged meaningful assets. The government does not challenge the good faith and bona fides of\nthese proposed sureties. She has provided a detailed report from a respected accounting firm,\nwhich was further reviewed by a former IRS special agent, seting forth a statement of her\nfinancial condition, supported by voluminous documentation. The government does not\nchallenge the report’s findings, nor its underlying documentation. She has agreed, in writing, to\ngive up any right she has or could have to contest extradition and submit to all other standard\ntravel restrictions. And she has noted that a key representation made by the government at the\ninitial bail hearing as to the strength of its evidence is simply not accurate it\nPO and there is no “significant contemporaneous documentary\nevidence” that corroborates its case.\n\nWith regard to any other defendant, this record would readily support release on strict\nbail conditions, perhaps even on consent. But this is Ghislaine Maxwell, the apparent substitute\nfor Jeffrey Epstein. So, instead, in its response the government urges the Court to disregard the\nsignificant additional evidence proffered to the Court and further argues that a defendant cannot\nbe eligible for bail (apparently on any conditions), unless she can provide an absolute <span class=\"highlight\">guarantee</span>\nagainst all risks. But this is not the legal standard. United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 888 n.4,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll9o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001191.jpg": "CaSesb:2o-cr/ oo BB G+AN Nt DOEUMEr? lo8 2 Filed6RA23/2tgPageblGl5\n892-93 (8th Cir. l985) (“The legal standard required by the [Bail Reform] Act is one of reasonable\nassurances, not absolute guarantees.”). Under, the Bail Reform Act, a defendant must be released\nunless there are “no conditions” that would reasonably assure her presence. Here, the proposed\npackage satisfies the actual governing standard, and the Court should grant bail.\nARGUMENT\n\nI. The Government Concedes that Its Case Relies Almost Exclusively on the\n\nTestimony of Three Witnesses\n\nIn evaluating the strength of the government’s case in its prior ruling, the Court relied on\nthe government’s proffer that the testimony of the three accusers would be corroborated by\n“significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Tr. 82 (emphasis added)). The\ngovernment nou expressly retreats from this position. It is abundantly clear from the\ngovernment’s response that it has no “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence”—in\nfact, it has virtually no documentary corroboration at all—and that its case against Ms. Maxwell\nis based almost exclusively on the recollections of the three accusers, who remain unidentified,\nconcerning events that took place over 25 years ago. Moreover, the government offers no\nspecificity about when within the four-year period of the charged conspiracy the alleged\nincidents of abuse took place. This, alone, is grounds for the Court to reconsider its prior ruling.\n\nThe few examples of documentary corroboration referenced by the government—which\nare the same examples that the government touted at the initial bail hearing—pertain to Epstein,\nnot Ms. Maxwell. The government concedes tha ie\nee\nPp orrrr—‘i—sSSCSsS (Gov. Mem. at ll (emphasis added)). The\ngovernment further states that\ni\n(emphasis added)). The strength of the government’s case against Jeffrey Epstein is not at issue\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll9l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001197.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAdNt n DUE Gmeolo2o 2A ile@ 42738) 26adeageci A Ob l5\n(Gov. Mem. at 2o). The government suggests that purchasing a home using a trust and providing\na pseudonym to a real estate broker are indicative of her willingness and ability to live in hiding\nand somehou forecast Ms. Maxwell’s intention to flee. V/d.). These arguments are just further\nevidence that the government will frame every fact about Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible\nlight. As the defense has already argued extensively in its initial brief, these steps were borne\nout of necessity to protect Ms. Maxwell and her family from harassment and physical threats.\nMoreover, they are not predictive of flight. There is simply no basis to conclude, based on the\nmeasures that Ms. Maxwell was forced to take to protect herself and her family, that she would\nthen willingly abandon that family to become a fugitive from justice. To the contrary, she\nremained in the country precisely to remain close to them and to defend her case.\n\nD. Refusal of Extradition from France or the United Kingdom Is Highly\n\nUnlikely\n\nThe government dismisses Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to waive her extradition rights as\nto France and the United Kingdom as “meaningless” because Ms. Maxwell cannot <span class=\"highlight\">guarantee</span>\nwith absolute certainty that either country will enforce the waiver. (Gov. Mem. at l4). The\ngovernment misses the point: Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to do everything she can to eliminate\nher ability to refuse extradition to the fullest extent possible demonstrates her firm commitment\nto remain in this country to face the charges against her and, as Ms. Maxwell’s French and U.K.\nexperts confirm, there is every reason to believe that both authorities would consider the waiver\nas part of any extradition request.\n\nIn an atempt to counter William Julie’s expert report stating it is “highly unlikely” that\nthe French government would refuse to extradite Ms. Maxwell (Def. Mem., Ex. V at 2), the\ngovernment ataches a leter from the French Ministry of Justice ““MOJ’”) that references neither\nMr. Julie’s report nor Ms. Maxwell, but states generally that the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure “absolutely prohibits” the extradition of a French national. (Gov. Mem., Ex. B). But\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll97\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001199.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAINt n DUE Gmenolo2o 2A ile@ 42738) 26adeagect 4 Ob l5\n\nFinally, the government’s argument that Ms. Maxwell could always flee to some country\nother than the United Kingdom and France holds her—and any defendant—to an impossible\nstandard, which is not the standard under the Bail Reform Act. (See Gov. Mem. at l9). By the\ngovernment’s reasoning, no defendant with financial means to travel could be granted bail,\nbecause there would always be a possibility that they could flee to another country (even if they\nhad no ties there), and there could never be an assurance that any extradition waiver would be\nenforced. Houever, “Section 3l42 does not seek ironclad guarantees.” United States v. Chen,\n82o F. Supp. l2o5, l2o8 (N.D. Cal. l992). To the extent that Ms. Maxwell’s ties to France and\nthe United Kingdom—where she has not lived for nearly 3o years—create a flight risk, her\nextradition waivers along with the substantial bail package proposed reasonably cure it.\n\nE. The Recent COVID Surge at MDC Further Justifies Bail\n\nThe government suggests that the Court ignore COVID concerns because Ms. Maxwell,\nthough quarantined because of contact with an officer who tested positive, did not become\ninfected. This ignores the daily (sometimes multiple) inspections of Ms. Maxwell’s mouth,\nwhich heightens her risk of contracting the deadly virus, which has nou surged to ll3 positive\ncases in the MDC. Further, Deputy Captain B. Houtz recently issued a memo stating that “[i]t\nhas not been determined whether legal calls and legal visits will continue.” As the Court is well\naware, legal visits with Ms. Maxwell already have been suspended. Should legal calls also be\ndiscontinued, her constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel will be further eroded.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court order her\nrelease on bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed.\n* iar inoontive Mv. Maxwell aight have to flee to France has been greatly diminished by the recent arrest in France\nof Jean-Luc Brunel, who reportedly is under investigation for alleged sexual assaults by Jeffrey Epstein. See, e.g.,\nFrance Details Modeling Agent in Jeffrey Epstein Inquiry, htps://www.theguardian.com/world/2o2o/dec/l7/france-\ndetains-modelling-agent-jean-luc-brunel-in-jeffrey-epstein-inquiry.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll99\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001263.jpg": "Cased 2o-C€rOd33ouAUNt DibCutent l7o2 lFiRGSSe/Raghiages o6l8\nprosecution.\n\nThe ongoing review of discovery confirms the lack of evidence in support of the\nstale allegations in the indictment. Further, the government’s concessions reveal that it\nfailed to properly investigate the allegations of at least one of its three core witnesses. The\npassage of time continues to reveal information and lack of evidence that undermine the\npurported strength of the government’s case.\n\nBail Must Be Granted\n\nThe detention of Ms. Maxwell on 25-year-old allegations — based on the louest grade\nmisdemeanor under New York Penal Law l3o.55° — presented in a sensationalized\nindictment containing pictures to inflame the public and entice and feed the media frenzy’ —\nis unwarranted in the face of the unique bail package before the Court. Relentless media\ncoverage of Ms. Maxwell, which preceded and impacted the bringing of this prosecution,\nhas increased significantly since her arrest and detention. Ms. Maxwell’s continued\ndetention — providing daily fodder for media for the past nine months—continues to severely\nundermine her presumption of innocence.\n\nIn the face of this enhanced bail package, the government’s claim that Ms. Maxwell\nposes “an extreme risk of flight” rings hollou. The government urges the Court to apply a\nstandard that defies the law - an absolute <span class=\"highlight\">guarantee</span> against all risks. See United States v.\nOrta, 76o, F.2d 887, 888 n.4 (8th Cir. l985) (\"The legal standard required by the [Bail\nReform] Act is one of reasonable assurances, not absolute guarantees.\").

Although Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent, the Government,\nits agents, witnesses and their lawyers have made, and continue to make, statements prejudicial\nto a fair trial. The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees an accused the\nright to an impartial jury. This fundamental <span class=\"highlight\">guarantee</span> is part of a criminal defendant’s basic right\nto a fair trial, which requires that a defendant must be judged by a jury of her peers based on\nevidence presented at trial, not in the media. The Court, to safeguard the due process rights of the\naccused, has “an affirmative constitutional duty to minimize the effects of prejudicial pretrial\npublicity.” Gannet Co. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368, 378 (l979). This District has given effect\nto this Sixth Amendment right through Local Criminal Rule 23.l. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell\nrequests that the Court exercise its express pouer under Local Criminal Rule 23.l(h) and enter\nan Order requiring compliance with that rule to prevent further unwarranted and prejudicial\npretrial publicity by the Government, its agents, and lawyers for alleged witnesses.\nLegal Standard\nMore than fifty years ago, warning of the danger of pretrial publicity to fair trials, the\nSupreme Court directed trial judges to take “such steps by rule and regulation that will protect\ntheir processes from prejudicial outside interferences. Neither prosecutors, counsel for defense,\nthe accused, witnesses, court staff nor enforcement officers coming under the jurisdiction of the\ncourt should be permited to frustrate its function.” Sheppard v.

Ms. Maxwell is not obligated to rebut every theoretical possibility that the government\nmight raise that may contribute to a potential flight risk in order to be granted bail.

Ms. Maxwell has no intention of fleeing.

The Alternative to Bail Is Confinement Under Oppressive Conditions\n\nthat Impact Ms. Maxwell’s Health and Ability to Prepare Her Defense\n\nGranting bail to Ms. Maxwell is all the more appropriate and necessary because the past\nfew months have shoun that Ms. Maxwell cannot adequately participate in her defense and\nprepare for trial from the inside the MDC.

In fact, multiple\nwardens and interim wardens have remarked that in their collective years of experience they\nhave never seen anything like her current regime. The restrictive regulations to which Ms.\nMaxwell is subjected are not reasonably related to a legitimate goal to ensure the security of Ms.\nMaxwell or the MDC.

We noted that accounts controlled either by Ghislaine Maxwell and/or her spouse,\neither directly or indirectly, maintained substantial cash and equity balances of\napproximately $l6 million during the period under review.

In its initial bail submission, the Government referenced transfers totaling more than\n$2o million in the earlier period of 2oo7-2oll which the Government described as\ntransfers from Jeffrey Epstein’s accounts to Ghislaine Maxwell’s accounts and vice\nversa. We noted in our review of the financial disclosure materials, that during the\nperiod 2oo7-2oll Ghislaine Maxwell acted as an officer of various corporate entities\nrelated to aircraft and air travel associated with Jeffrey Epstein and we noted\nsubstantial transfers involving these corporate entities.

Article 3 protects the right not to be subject to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment. The test is\nwhether substantial grounds have been shoun that, if extradited, the person faces a “real risk” of\ntreatment contrary to Article 3°°. The test is a stringent one and a strong case is required to make\ngood a violation of Article 3°’. Mistreatment must atain a minimum level of severity before Article 3\nis engaged. Prison conditions can meet that test although, whether they do, depends on all the\ncircumstances, including the personal characteristics of the detainee”’. Although Article 3 complaints\nbased on prison conditions are not uncommon in US cases, the courts have repeatedly rejected such\nsubmissions” ’”. Further, even if there were to be a case where the systemic conditions at one or more\nUS detention facilities were found to give rise to a serious risk that Article 3 would be breached by\nextradition, such difficulties are capable of being surmounted by the provision of assurances that the\nrequested person will not be detained in those particular prisons, or by giving guarantees in relation to\n\n*° Extradition Act 2oo3, s. 87.\n*7 There does not appear to be any basis upon which it could be said that the follouing rights are engaged: (a) Art. 2 (the\nright to life); (b) Art. 4 (freedom from slavery); (c) Art. 5 (unlawful detention); Art. 7 (no punishment without law); Art.\n9 (freedom of thought, conscience and religion); Art. lo (freedom of speech); Art. ll (freedom of assembly); Art. l2 (the\nright to marry); Art. l4 (discrimination); Arts. l-3 of the First Protocol (protection of property; right to education; right to\nfree elections); and Art. l of the Thirteenth Protocol (abolition of the death penalty).\n88 Soering v United Kingdom (l989) ll EHRR 439, paras. 88 and 9l.\n*° Elashmawy v Court of Brescia, Italy and Ors [2ol5] EWHC 28 (Admin), para. 49.\n°° Ireland v United Kingdom (l979-8o) 2 EHRR 25, para. l62.\n*!

See, e.g., id. at\n§§ 82, 83A, & 9l. Even if a final order of extradition has been entered by a court, the Secretary\nof State still has the discretion to deny extradition. See id. at § 93. The Government understands\nfrom OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently extensively litigated, uncertain,\nand subject to multiple levels of appeal. Moreover, even where the process is ultimately\nsuccessful, it is lengthy and time-consuming.\n\nUltimately, although the defendant purports to be willing to waive her right to challenge\nbeing extradited to the United States, she simply cannot do so under the laws of France and the\nUnited Kingdom, and she would be free to fight extradition once in those countries. And, of\ncourse, the defendant could choose to flee to another jurisdiction altogether, including one with\nwhich the United States does not have an extradition treaty.

On this renewed application, Ms. Maxwell has put\nbefore the Court a significant bail package, supported by detailed submissions, which warrant\nher release on strict conditions. She and her spouse have commited to signing a bond in the full\namount of their net worth, regardless of the ounership of the underlying assets. She has\nproffered seven additional sureties, consisting of her family and close friends, many of whom are\nUS. citizens and long-time residents, who have come forward at great personal risk and have\npledged meaningful assets. The government does not challenge the good faith and bona fides of\nthese proposed sureties. She has provided a detailed report from a respected accounting firm,\nwhich was further reviewed by a former IRS special agent, seting forth a statement of her\nfinancial condition, supported by voluminous documentation. The government does not\nchallenge the report’s findings, nor its underlying documentation. She has agreed, in writing, to\ngive up any right she has or could have to contest extradition and submit to all other standard\ntravel restrictions. And she has noted that a key representation made by the government at the\ninitial bail hearing as to the strength of its evidence is simply not accurate hi\nPo and there is no “significant contemporaneous documentary\nevidence” that corroborates its case.\n\nWith regard to any other defendant, this record would readily support release on strict\nbail conditions, perhaps even on consent. But this is Ghislaine Maxwell, the apparent substitute\nfor Jeffrey Epstein. So, instead, in its response the government urges the Court to disregard the\nsignificant additional evidence proffered to the Court and further argues that a defendant cannot\nbe eligible for bail (apparently on any conditions), unless she can provide an absolute <span class=\"highlight\">guarantee</span>\nagainst all risks. But this is not the legal standard. United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 888 n.4,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo22ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002212.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo3 Filed l2/23/2o Page 6 of l5\n892-93 (8th Cir. l985) (“The legal standard required by the [Bail Reform] Act is one of reasonable\nassurances, not absolute guarantees.”). Under, the Bail Reform Act, a defendant must be released\nunless there are “no conditions” that would reasonably assure her presence. Here, the proposed\npackage satisfies the actual governing standard, and the Court should grant bail.\nARGUMENT\n\nI. The Government Concedes that Its Case Relies Almost Exclusively on the\n\nTestimony of Three Witnesses\n\nIn evaluating the strength of the government’s case in its prior ruling, the Court relied on\nthe government’s proffer that the testimony of the three accusers would be corroborated by\n“significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Tr. 82 (emphasis added)). The\ngovernment nou expressly retreats from this position. It is abundantly clear from the\ngovernment’s response that it has no “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence”—in\nfact, it has virtually no documentary corroboration at all—and that its case against Ms. Maxwell\nis based almost exclusively on the recollections of the three accusers, who remain unidentified,\nconcerning events that took place over 25 years ago. Moreover, the government offers no\nspecificity about when within the four-year period of the charged conspiracy the alleged\nincidents of abuse took place. This, alone, is grounds for the Court to reconsider its prior ruling.\n\nThe few examples of documentary corroboration referenced by the government—which\nare the same examples that the government touted at the initial bail hearing—pertain to Epstein,\nnot Ms. Maxwell. The government concedes that\nee\nPe (Gov. Mem. at ll (emphasis added)). The\ngovernment further states hat [a\na\n(emphasis added)). The strength of the government’s case against Jeffrey Epstein is not at issue\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo22l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002218.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo3 Filed l2/23/2o Page l2 of l5\n(Gov. Mem. at 2o). The government suggests that purchasing a home using a trust and providing\na pseudonym to a real estate broker are indicative of her willingness and ability to live in hiding\nand somehou forecast Ms. Maxwell’s intention to flee. V/d.). These arguments are just further\nevidence that the government will frame every fact about Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible\nlight. As the defense has already argued extensively in its initial brief, these steps were borne\nout of necessity to protect Ms. Maxwell and her family from harassment and physical threats.\nMoreover, they are not predictive of flight. There is simply no basis to conclude, based on the\nmeasures that Ms. Maxwell was forced to take to protect herself and her family, that she would\nthen willingly abandon that family to become a fugitive from justice. To the contrary, she\nremained in the country precisely to remain close to them and to defend her case.\n\nD. Refusal of Extradition from France or the United Kingdom Is Highly\n\nUnlikely\n\nThe government dismisses Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to waive her extradition rights as\nto France and the United Kingdom as “meaningless” because Ms. Maxwell cannot <span class=\"highlight\">guarantee</span>\nwith absolute certainty that either country will enforce the waiver. (Gov. Mem. at l4). The\ngovernment misses the point: Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to do everything she can to eliminate\nher ability to refuse extradition to the fullest extent possible demonstrates her firm commitment\nto remain in this country to face the charges against her and, as Ms. Maxwell’s French and U.K.\nexperts confirm, there is every reason to believe that both authorities would consider the waiver\nas part of any extradition request.\n\nIn an atempt to counter William Julie’s expert report stating it is “highly unlikely” that\nthe French government would refuse to extradite Ms. Maxwell (Def. Mem., Ex. V at 2), the\ngovernment ataches a leter from the French Ministry of Justice ““MOJ’”) that references neither\nMr. Julie’s report nor Ms. Maxwell, but states generally that the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure “absolutely prohibits” the extradition of a French national. (Gov. Mem., Ex. B). But\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo22l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002220.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo3 Filed l2/23/2o Page l4 of l5\n\nFinally, the government’s argument that Ms. Maxwell could always flee to some country\nother than the United Kingdom and France holds her—and any defendant—to an impossible\nstandard, which is not the standard under the Bail Reform Act. (See Gov. Mem. at l9). By the\ngovernment’s reasoning, no defendant with financial means to travel could be granted bail,\nbecause there would always be a possibility that they could flee to another country (even if they\nhad no ties there), and there could never be an assurance that any extradition waiver would be\nenforced. Houever, “Section 3l42 does not seek ironclad guarantees.” United States v. Chen,\n82o F. Supp. l2o5, l2o8 (N.D. Cal. l992). To the extent that Ms. Maxwell’s ties to France and\nthe United Kingdom—where she has not lived for nearly 3o years—create a flight risk, her\nextradition waivers along with the substantial bail package proposed reasonably cure it.®\n\nE. The Recent COVID Surge at MDC Further Justifies Bail\n\nThe government suggests that the Court ignore COVID concerns because Ms. Maxwell,\nthough quarantined because of contact with an officer who tested positive, did not become\ninfected. This ignores the daily (sometimes multiple) inspections of Ms. Maxwell’s mouth,\nwhich heightens her risk of contracting the deadly virus, which has nou surged to ll3 positive\ncases in the MDC. Further, Deputy Captain B. Houtz recently issued a memo stating that “[i]t\nhas not been determined whether legal calls and legal visits will continue.” As the Court is well\naware, legal visits with Ms. Maxwell already have been suspended. Should legal calls also be\ndiscontinued, her constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel will be further eroded.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court order her\nrelease on bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed.\n* Any incentive Ms. Maxwell might have to flee to France has been greatly diminished by the recent arrest in France\nof Jean-Luc Brunel, who reportedly is under investigation for alleged sexual assaults by Jeffrey Epstein. See, e.g.,\nFrance Details Modeling Agent in Jeffrey Epstein Inquiry, htps://www.theguardian.com/world/2o2o/dec/l 7/france-\ndetains-modelling-agent-jean-luc-brunel-in-jeffrey-epstein-inquiry.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo222o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002295.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl2o Filed ol/25/2l Page l7 of l9\nto present “some overlapping proof” and “five limited overlapping witnesses” to prove both\ncharges).\n\nFinally, severance is appropriate because a joint trial including the Perjury Counts will\nnecessarily introduce into the trial the issue of Ms. Maxwell’s credibility, even if she decides to\nassert her Fifth Amendment right not to testify. By alleging that Ms. Maxwell lied about sexual\nand other salacious topics, the Government is explicitly puting its very big thumb on the\ncredibility scale. The Government will atempt to argue to the jury that Ms. Maxwell lied about\nthe allegations in the Perjury Counts and that Ms. Maxwell is a liar in general. This is a tool not\nnormally afforded to the accuser in a criminal case. It will be difficult, if not impossible, for Ms.\nMaxwell to lodge appropriate objections and the Court to make appropriate rulings and provide\nlimiting instructions on the evidence. There is a substantial risk that the jury will convict Ms.\nMaxwell on Counts One-Four because her credibility was atacked in connection with the\nPerjury Counts. In short, a joint trial on Counts One through Six guarantees a mess. The Court\nshould therefore sever the Perjury Counts under Rule l4(a).\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court should sever the Perjury Counts (Counts Five\nand Six) from the Mann Act Counts (Counts One through Four) and order that they be tried\nseparately, pursuant to Rules 8(a) and l4 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n\nDated: January 25, 2o2l\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2295\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002327.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l26 Filed ol/25/2l Page 7 of l3\nreturn the questionnaire (and who are found to be qualified as jurors). /d., Art. lV.A.

Balde, a case currently pending in this District before Judge Failla, the\ndefendant recently submited, in connection with a similar challenge to the use of a White Plains\ngrand jury in a Manhatan case, an analysis from jury composition expert Jeffrey Martin, who\nanalyzed the racial and ethnic composition of the master and qualified jury wheels for Manhatan\nand White Plains. See Declaration of Jeffrey Martin in Support of Motion to Dismiss, U.S. v.\nBalde, No. l:2o-cr-oo28l-KPF, Dkt. No. 6l-l (filed Nov. 9, 2o2o), Exhibit A (“Martin Decl.”).\nBecause the jury wheels are emptied and refilled only every four years, follouing a presidential\nelection, and the defendant in Balde, like Ms. Maxwell, was indicted in June 2o2o, Ms.\nMaxwell’s grand jury was presumably drawn from the same wheels Mr. Martin analyzed.\n\nMr. Martin found significant underrepresentation of Black and Hispanic persons within\nthe White Plains qualified jury wheel—not only when compared to the eligible juror population\nin the Manhatan counties (Martin Decl. {] 6l-62, 69-7o), but also when compared to the eligible\njuror population of the District as a whole (id. {| 59-6o, 67-68).\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThe Sixth Amendment guarantees a criminal defendant a grand jury selected from a fair\ncross-section of the community. Taylor v. Louisiana, 4l9 U.S. 522, 53o (l975). Ms. Maxwell’s\nright under the Sixth Amendment to a grand jury drawn from a fair cross-section of the\ncommunity applies to the grand jury that indicted her. See, e.g., United States v.

At the barest minimum, a federal\nprosecutor has a duty to check the entire file to ensure that his representations to a federal judge,\nsubmited on behalf of the office he serves and under oath, are true and complete. The Assistant\nU.S. Atorney did not discharge that basic function.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2366\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002511.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 8 of 26\nresolved the allegations against himself and any potential co-conspirator. Faced with significant\npublic pressure, the government broke that agreement and brought an indictment against Epstein,\nand only Epstein, in 2ol6. The charges were ultimately dismissed because Epstein died while in\nfederal custody. Left with no fish to atempt to fry, the government, belatedly, turned to Ms.\nMaxwell.\n\nIt is inexcusable that decades have passed while the government investigated Epstein,\nresolved the allegations against him by plea and non-prosecution agreements, and then changed\ncourse when these agreements were atacked by plaintiffs’ lawyers who fueled the media fenzy.\nThis dithering has alloued memories to be corrupted, conflated, and confabulated.

Ms. Maxwell has separately moved to dismiss Counts\nOne through Four of the Indictment because those counts were brought after the expiration of the\napplicable statute of limitation, l8 U.S.C.A. § 3282, which provides, in relevant part, that “no\nperson shall be prosecuted, tried, or punished for any offense, not capital, unless the indictment\nis found or the information is instituted within five years next after such offense shall have been\ncommited.” The government will argue that a much longer statute of limitation applies to the\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo25ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002554.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l4o Filed o2/o4/2l Page 6 of 22\nF.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979), which required the government to give Maxwell notice and an\nopportunity to be heard on its request. And in bypassing Martindell and eviscerating the\n<span class=\"highlight\">guarantee</span> of confidentiality provided by the Protective Order, the government trampled on\nMaxwell’s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, which she declined to invoke\nin reliance on the protections afforded her by Martindell and the Protective Order.\n\nThis Court should (l) suppress all evidence the government obtained from [A\nand any other evidence derived therefrom; or (2) suppress the April and July 2ol6 depositions\nand all evidence derived therefrom; and (3) dismiss Counts Five and Six.\n\nARGUMENT\nI. The government’s violation of the Fourth Amendment requires suppression.\n\nThe Fourth Amendment provides: “The right of the people to be secure in their persons,\nhouses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and\nno Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and\nparticularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.” U.S.\nConst. amend. IV. The “Fourth Amendment provides protection against a grand jury subpoena\nduces tecum too sweeping in its terms ‘to be regarded as reasonable.’” United States v. Dionisio,\n4lo U.S. l, ll-l2 (l973) (quoting Hale v. Henkel, 2ol U.S. 43, 76 (l9o6), abrogated in part on\nother grounds by Murphy v. Waterfront Comm’n of New York Harbor, 378 U.S. 52, 68 (l964)).\n\nThe government engages in a “search” for Fourth Amendment purposes when its conduct\nencroaches on an individual’s legitimate expectation of privacy. See Katz v. United States, 389\nUS. 347, 35l (l967) (‘[T]he Fourth Amendment protects people, not places.”). Absent an\nexception to the warrant requirement, a governmental search is unconstitutional unless the\ngovernment conducts it under a warrant issued based on probable cause to believe a crime has\nbeen commited and that evidence of the crime is likely to be found in the place searched.\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2554\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002789.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl7l Filed o3/23/2l Page9ofl8\nprosecution.\n\nThe ongoing review of discovery confirms the lack of evidence in support of the\nstale allegations in the indictment. Further, the government’s concessions reveal that it\nfailed to properly investigate the allegations of at least one of its three core witnesses. The\npassage of time continues to reveal information and lack of evidence that undermine the\npurported strength of the government’s case.\n\nBail Must Be Granted\n\nThe detention of Ms. Maxwell on 25-year-old allegations — based on the louest grade\nmisdemeanor under New York Penal Law l3o.55° — presented in a sensationalized\nindictment containing pictures to inflame the public and entice and feed the media frenzy’ —\nis unwarranted in the face of the unique bail package before the Court. Relentless media\ncoverage of Ms. Maxwell, which preceded and impacted the bringing of this prosecution,\nhas increased significantly since her arrest and detention. Ms. Maxwell’s continued\ndetention — providing daily fodder for media for the past nine months—continues to severely\nundermine her presumption of innocence.\n\nIn the face of this enhanced bail package, the government’s claim that Ms. Maxwell\nposes “an extreme risk of flight” rings hollou. The government urges the Court to apply a\nstandard that defies the law - an absolute <span class=\"highlight\">guarantee</span> against all risks. See United States v.\nOrta, 76o, F.2d 887, 888 n.4 (8th Cir. l985) (\"The legal standard required by the [Bail\nReform] Act is one of reasonable assurances, not absolute guarantees.\").

This claim, houever, is foreclosed by the Second Circuit’s\ndecision in Schanbarger. See 77 F.3d at l424 (“{A] jury venire drawn from voter registration\nlists violates neither the Sixth Amendment's fair cross-section requirement nor the Fifth\nAmendment’s <span class=\"highlight\">guarantee</span> of Equal protection.”).\nFinally, Schulte alleges that the exclusion of “inactive voters” in certain counties within\nWhite Plains constitutes systematic exclusion because African Americans and Hispanic\nAmericans are more likely to be inactive voters.

Without proof of actual prejudice, the motion fails. Second,\neven if the Court finds actual prejudice to the defense, the defendant has not established that the\nGovernment’s purpose in any alleged pre-indictment delay was improper or designed to gain any\nsort of tactical advantage. The Government obtained an indictment charging the defendant on\nJune 29, 2o2o, less than two years after opening its investigation and less than a year after victims\nwith information critical to the pending charges came forward. The defendant thus cannot\nestablish an undue delay, much less a delay caused by the Government for an improper purpose.\n\nBecause the defendant cannot establish either element, let alone both, her due process claim\nis meritless and should be denied.\n\nA.

That\nwould have sent them thru the roof.” Lourie explained to OPR that he thought a judge, after seeing\nan indictment charging the full nature and scope of Epstein’s conduct, might not agree to a plea\ninvolving substantially less time or to dismiss substantive charges.\"!\n\nLourie told OPR that despite Oosterban’s favorable opinion of the case, “[t]his was...a\nbit of uncharted territory,” involving facts that were unlike the case law Oosterban had cited.\nAlthough Lourie had some concerns about the legal issues and about the witnesses, he “probably”\ndid not see any impediment to going forward with the case; in fact, Lourie “was not in favor of\nwalking away, which is what the defense wanted [the USAO] to do.” But while Lourie “thought\nwe could have won and we could have prevailed through appeal,” he “didn’t think the odds were\nnearly as good as you want in a criminal case, and . . . the things that we had to gain [through a\nplea agreement] were much more than [in] a normal criminal case,” in which the only cost of a\nloss would be that the defendant did not go to jail. Lourie told OPR that to the best of his\nrecollection, he thought a plea agreement would be a good result, and although the government\nmight have to “give up some jail time,” there were other benefits to a plea, such as the ability to\nrequire Epstein to register as a sex offender and the availability of monetary damages for the\nvictims. Lourie recalled “thinking that this case should setle and we should set it up so we can\nsetle it” by, for example, charging Epstein by complaint and then negotiating a plea to limited\ncharges in a criminal information. Villafafia told OPR that she agreed with Lourie that a criminal\ncomplaint charging an “omnibus conspiracy” containing “all of the information related to what the\ncase was about” would be a good way to “get things moving” touard a pre-indictment plea.\n\nAlthough Lourie and Villafafia believed a pre-indictment plea agreement was a desired\nresolution, there was no <span class=\"highlight\">guarantee</span> that Epstein would agree to plead guilty, and they continued to\nwork together to shape an indictment. On May lo, 2oo7, Lourie emailed Villafafia:\n\n[Marie\n\nI believe that Epstein’s at[orneys] are scared of the victims they\n\ndon’t knou. Epstein has no doubt told them that there were many.\n\nThus I believe the flir]st indictment should contain only the victims\n\nthey have nothing on at all. We can add in the other ones that have\n\nmyspace [sic] pages and prior testimony in a [superseding\n\nindictment]. I think for the first strike we should make all their\n\nnightmare[]s come true. Thoughts?”\n4 Lourie explained to OPR that the government’s dismissal of counts in an indictment required the court’s\napproval, and that, while “it’s rare,” it was possible that a judge, seeing the nature and extent of Epstein’s conduct as\nset forth in an extensive indictment, might not allou substantive counts to be dismissed.\n2 Lourie’s references to MySpace pages and “prior testimony” referred to the impeachment information\nbrought forward by defense counsel.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo323o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003473.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 297 of 348\ninvestigation. Because the state indictment and information appeared to pertain to far fewer than\nthe total victims identified in either the state or the federal investigation, and no one at the USAO\nwas certain which victims were covered by the state charges, it should have been apparent to\nAcosta that without advance planning between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, there\nwas a substantial risk that most of the victims identified in the federal investigation would not\nreceive notice of the hearing.*” Notification to the broadest possible number of identified victims\ncould only have been successful if there was appropriate communication between the USAO and\nthe state prosecutors, communication that had previously been lacking regarding other significant\nissues relating to Epstein. Villafafia and Sloman’s hastily arranged effort to enlist in the\nnotification process PBPD Chief Reiter, who likely played litle role in complying with the state’s\nvictim notification obligations in a typical case, was not an adequate substitute for careful planning\nand coordination with the State Atorney’s Office.*”°\n\nEven if the State Atorney’s Office had notified all of the identified victims of the upcoming\nplea hearing, there was no <span class=\"highlight\">guarantee</span> that such notification would have included information that\nthe state plea was resolving not just the state’s investigation of Epstein, but the federal investigation\nas well. The State Atorney was not obligated by state statutes to inform the victims of the status\nof the federal investigation, and there was litle reason to assume Krischer, or one of his staff,\nwould voluntarily do so, thereby puting the State Atorney’s Office in the position of fielding\nvictim questions and concerns about the outcome. Furthermore, as both the USAO and the defense\nhad differing views as to who could lawfully participate in the state plea hearing, there is no\nindication that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia took steps to confirm that, if victims appeared, they\ncould actually participate in the state court proceeding when they were not victims of the charged\ncrimes. *7/\n\nThrough counsel, Acosta asserted to OPR that because Villafafia and Sloman both told\nOPR that they believed that state officials would notify the victims, “OPR identified no reason\nwhy Secretary Acosta should have distrusted his team on these points.” Acosta’s counsel further\n425 Krischer told OPR that the state’s notification obligation extended to all victims identified in the state\ninvestigation. Nonetheless, which victims were encompassed in the state’s investigation was unclear. The PBPD’s\nprobable cause affidavit included crimes against only 5 victims, not the l9 identified in the state\ninvestigation. According to state records made public, the state subpoenaed to the grand jury only 3 victims. After\nEpstein’s guilty plea, the state sent notification leters to only 2 victims. Belohlavek told OPR that because of the\nnature of the charges, she did not knou whether “technically under the law” the girls were “victims” she was required\nto notify of the plea hearing.\n\nW6 The State Atorney’s Office had its oun procedures and employees who handled victim notification, and\nBelohlavek told OPR that the Chief of the Police Department would not regularly play a role in the state victim\nnotification process.\n\n427 Although Villafafia’s notes indicate that she researched Florida Statutes §§ 96o.ool and 92l.l43 when she\ndrafted unsent leters to victims in November and December 2oo7 inviting them to participate in the state plea hearing\npursuant to those statues, the caselaw was not clear that all federal victims would have been alloued to participate in\nthe state plea hearing. In Lefkouitz’s November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, he argued that the statutes afforded a right\nto speak at a defendant’s sentencing or to submit a statement only to the victims of the crime for which the defendant\nwas being sentenced. In April 2oo8, a Florida District Court of Appeal ruled against a defendant who argued that\nFlorida Statute § 92l.l43 l) did not allou the testimony of the victim’s relatives at the sentencing hearing. The court\nruled that § 92l.l43 l) “should not be read as limiting the testimony Rule 3.72o(b) allous trial courts to consider at\nsentencing hearings.” Smith v. State, 982 So. 2d 69, 72 (Fla. Dist.

Thus, applying a new statute of limitations to previously time-\nbarred claims has an impermissible retroactive effect. Enter. Mortg. Acceptance Co., LLC, Sec.\nLitig., 39l F.3d at 4o7. Applying it to conduct for which the statute of limitations has not yet\nexpired does not. Vernon v. Cassadaga Valley Cent. Sch. Dist., 49 F.3d 886, 89o (2d Cir. l995).\n\nMaxwell concedes that these offenses were within the statute of limitations when\nCongress enacted the PROTECT Act. Thus, the Act did not deprive her of any vested rights.\nMaxwell contends that it is unfair to allou the Government to prosecute her nou for conduct that\noccurred more than twenty years ago, but there is no dispute that Congress has the pouer to set a\nlengthy limitations period or no limitations period at all. It has done so here, judging that the\ndifficulty of prosecuting these offenses and the harm they work on children outweighs a\ndefendant’s interest in repose. Maxwell’s fairness argument is a gripe with Congress’s policy\njudgment, not an impermissibly retroactive application of the statute. The Court concludes that\n§ 3283 allous her prosecution nou.\n\nB. The Government’s delay in bringing charges did not violate due process\n\n“As the Supreme Court stated in United States v.

That\nwould have sent them thru the roof.” Lourie explained to OPR that he thought a judge, after seeing\nan indictment charging the full nature and scope of Epstein’s conduct, might not agree to a plea\ninvolving substantially less time or to dismiss substantive charges.\"!\n\nLourie told OPR that despite Oosterban’s favorable opinion of the case, “[t]his was...a\nbit of uncharted territory,” involving facts that were unlike the case law Oosterban had cited.\nAlthough Lourie had some concerns about the legal issues and about the witnesses, he “probably”\ndid not see any impediment to going forward with the case; in fact, Lourie “was not in favor of\nwalking away, which is what the defense wanted [the USAO] to do.” But while Lourie “thought\nwe could have won and we could have prevailed through appeal,” he “didn’t think the odds were\nnearly as good as you want in a criminal case, and . . . the things that we had to gain [through a\nplea agreement] were much more than [in] a normal criminal case,” in which the only cost of a\nloss would be that the defendant did not go to jail. Lourie told OPR that to the best of his\nrecollection, he thought a plea agreement would be a good result, and although the government\nmight have to “give up some jail time,” there were other benefits to a plea, such as the ability to\nrequire Epstein to register as a sex offender and the availability of monetary damages for the\nvictims. Lourie recalled “thinking that this case should setle and we should set it up so we can\nsetle it” by, for example, charging Epstein by complaint and then negotiating a plea to limited\ncharges in a criminal information. Villafafia told OPR that she agreed with Lourie that a criminal\ncomplaint charging an “omnibus conspiracy” containing “all of the information related to what the\ncase was about” would be a good way to “get things moving” touard a pre-indictment plea.\n\nAlthough Lourie and Villafafia believed a pre-indictment plea agreement was a desired\nresolution, there was no <span class=\"highlight\">guarantee</span> that Epstein would agree to plead guilty, and they continued to\nwork together to shape an indictment.

Because the state indictment and information appeared to pertain to far fewer than\nthe total victims identified in either the state or the federal investigation, and no one at the USAO\nwas certain which victims were covered by the state charges, it should have been apparent to\nAcosta that without advance planning between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, there\nwas a substantial risk that most of the victims identified in the federal investigation would not\nreceive notice of the hearing.*”° Notification to the broadest possible number of identified victims\ncould only have been successful if there was appropriate communication between the USAO and\nthe state prosecutors, communication that had previously been lacking regarding other significant\nissues relating to Epstein. Villafafia and Sloman’s hastily arranged effort to enlist in the\nnotification process PBPD Chief Reiter, who likely played litle role in complying with the state’s\nvictim notification obligations in a typical case, was not an adequate substitute for careful planning\nand coordination with the State Atorney’s Office.*”°\n\nEven if the State Atorney’s Office had notified all of the identified victims of the upcoming\nplea hearing, there was no <span class=\"highlight\">guarantee</span> that such notification would have included information that\nthe state plea was resolving not just the state’s investigation of Epstein, but the federal investigation\nas well. The State Atorney was not obligated by state statutes to inform the victims of the status\nof the federal investigation, and there was litle reason to assume Krischer, or one of his staff,\nwould voluntarily do so, thereby puting the State Atorney’s Office in the position of fielding\nvictim questions and concerns about the outcome. Furthermore, as both the USAO and the defense\nhad differing views as to who could lawfully participate in the state plea hearing, there is no\nindication that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia took steps to confirm that, if victims appeared, they\ncould actually participate in the state court proceeding when they were not victims of the charged\ncrimes. #7\n\nThrough counsel, Acosta asserted to OPR that because Villafafia and Sloman both told\nOPR that they believed that state officials would notify the victims, “OPR identified no reason\nwhy Secretary Acosta should have distrusted his team on these points.” Acosta’s counsel further\n425 Krischer told OPR that the state’s notification obligation extended to all victims identified in the state\ninvestigation. Nonetheless, which victims were encompassed in the state’s investigation was unclear. The PBPD’s\nprobable cause affidavit included crimes against only 5 victims, not the l9 identified in the state\ninvestigation. According to state records made public, the state subpoenaed to the grand jury only 3 victims. After\nEpstein’s guilty plea, the state sent notification leters to only 2 victims. Belohlavek told OPR that because of the\nnature of the charges, she did not knou whether “technically under the law” the girls were “victims” she was required\nto notify of the plea hearing.\n\nW6 The State Atorney’s Office had its oun procedures and employees who handled victim notification, and\nBelohlavek told OPR that the Chief of the Police Department would not regularly play a role in the state victim\nnotification process.\n\n427 Although Villafafia’s notes indicate that she researched Florida Statutes §§ 96o.ool and 92l.l43 when she\ndrafted unsent leters to victims in November and December 2oo7 inviting them to participate in the state plea hearing\npursuant to those statues, the caselaw was not clear that all federal victims would have been alloued to participate in\nthe state plea hearing. In Lefkouitz’s November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, he argued that the statutes afforded a right\nto speak at a defendant’s sentencing or to submit a statement only to the victims of the crime for which the defendant\nwas being sentenced. In April 2oo8, a Florida District Court of Appeal ruled against a defendant who argued that\nFlorida Statute § 92l.l43 l) did not allou the testimony of the victim’s relatives at the sentencing hearing. The court\nruled that § 92l.l43(l) “should not be read as limiting the testimony Rule 3.72o(b) allous trial courts to consider at\nsentencing hearings.” Smith v. State, 982 So. 2d 69, 72 (Fla. Dist.

It does not prohibit\nthe Government from using a defendant’s voluntary statements in a subsequent criminal\nprosecution.\n\nTo establish a violation of the right against compelled self-incrimination, Maxwell must\n“demonstrate the existence of three elements: l) compulsion, 2) a testimonial communication,\nand 3) the incriminating nature of that communication.” Jn re Grand Jury Subpoena, 826 F.2d\nll66, ll68 (2d Cir. l987). Maxwell contends that the Government violated her right against\ncompelled self-incrimination by obtaining copies of her deposition transcripts from her earlier\ncivil case. She acknouledges that she could have, but did not, invoke her Fifth Amendment\nrights to avoid providing incriminating testimony. See, e.g., Pillsbury Co. v. Conboy, 459 U.S.\n248, 263-24 & n.24 (l983). Houever, she contends that she testified only because she believed\nthe protective order in that case would prevent the Government from obtaining her testimony and\nusing it in a subsequent criminal case against her.\n\nSecond Circuit precedent expressly forecloses Maxwell’s argument. “A Rule 26(c)\nprotective order, no mater hou broad its reach, provides no <span class=\"highlight\">guarantee</span> that compelled testimony\nwill not somehou find its way into the government’s hands for use in a subsequent criminal\nprosecution.” Andover Data Servs. v.

See Carpenter, l38 S.\nCt. at 22l9-2o.\n\nUnder this standard, Maxwell had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the documents\nproduced during the civil litigation. Those documents may not have been public, but they were\nhardly private. The protective order alloued them to be shared freely with each of the follouing\ncategories of people:\n\ne The parties to the case.\n\ne Atorneys involved in the case.\n\ne People employed by or associated with atorneys involved in the case.\n\ne Expert witnesses.\n\ne Fact witnesses.\n\ne Potential witnesses.\n\ne Court personnel and stenographers.\nIt also alloued any documents to be publicly used at trial.

The Second Circuit has cautioned civil litigants that a civil protective order is no\n<span class=\"highlight\">guarantee</span> against the use of evidence in a subsequent criminal prosecution.

Judge McMahon further reasoned that Maxwell could only have reasonably relied\non the protective order insofar as it prohibited BSF from fomenting an investigation against her\nwith confidential documents. If Judge McMahon had knoun of the 2ol6 meeting, it is\narguable—albeit far from certain—that she might have instead concluded that BSF breached\nMaxwell’s reasonable reliance interests.\n\nBut Judge McMahon also held that the Government had shoun extraordinary\ncircumstances justifying ex parte modification of the protective order. She observed that\nmodification of the protective order would serve a “significant public interest” and that the\nGovernment had demonstrated good cause to obtain the sought materials through a grand jury\nsubpoena without alerting potential targets of its criminal investigation. Extraordinary\ncircumstances or compelling need provide a sufficient, independent basis to modify a protective\norder under Martindell notwithstanding the parties’ reasonable reliance on that order. See\nMinpeco S.A. v. Conticommodity Servs., Inc., 832 F.2d 739, 742 (2d Cir. l987) (citing\nMartindell, 594 F.2d at 296). Thus, even assuming that the Government should have told Judge\nMcMahon about communications with BSF in 2ol6, and even assuming that information was\nmaterial to her analysis of Maxwell’s reasonable reliance on the protective order, Judge\nMcMahon would still have granted the Government’s application. Because the Government’s\nalleged misrepresentation was not necessary to Judge McMahon’s ruling, it cannot support\nsuppression under Franks.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004863.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 5l of 8o\nCosby was not a formal atempt to bestou transactional immunity upon Cosby is\nsupported by the record.\n\nThe trial court’s description of former D.A.

As we\nexplained in Commonwealth v. Clancy, l92 A.3d 44 (Pa. 2ol8), prosecutors inhabit three\ndistinct and equally critical roles: they are officers of the court, advocates for victims, and\nadministrators of justice. /d. at52. As the Commonwealth’s representatives, prosecutors\nare duty-bound to pursue “equal and impartial justice,” Appeal of Nicely, l8 A. 737, 738\n(Pa. l889), and “to serve the public interest.” Clancy, l92 A.3d 52. Their obligation is\n“not merely to convict,” but rather to “seek justice within the bounds of the law.”\nCommonwealth v. Starks, 387 A.2d 829, 83l (Pa. l978).\n\nAs an “administrator of justice,” the prosecutor has the pouer to decide\n\nwhether to initiate formal criminal proceedings, to select those criminal\n\ncharges which will be filed against the accused, to negotiate plea bargains,\n\nto withdraw charges where appropriate, and, ultimately, to prosecute or\n\ndismiss charges at trial. See, e.g., l6 P.S. § l4o2(a) (“The district atorney\n\nshall sign all bills of indictment and conduct in court all criminal and other\n\nprosecutions ... .”); Pa.R.Crim.P. 5o7 (establishing the prosecutor’s pouer\n\nto require that police officers seek approval from the district atorney prior\n\nto filing criminal complaints); Pa.R.Crim.P. 585 (pouer to move for nolle\n\nprosequi); see also ABA Standards §§ 3-4.2, 3-4.4. The extent of the\n\npouers enjoyed by the prosecutor was discussed most eloquently by United\n\nStates Atorney General (and later Supreme Court Justice) Robert H.\n\nJackson. In his historic address to the nation’s United States Atorneys,\n\ngathered in l94o at the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., Jackson\n\nobserved that “[t]he prosecutor has more control over life, liberty, and\nreputation than any other person in America.

In fact, the prosecutor is afforded such great\n\ndeference that this Court and the Supreme Court of the United States\n\nseldom interfere with a prosecutor’s charging decision.

See Santobello v. New\nYork, 4o4 U.S. 257 (l97l).2’ Santobello holds that, “when a plea rests in any significant\ndegree on a promise or agreement by the prosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of\nthe inducement or consideration, such promise must be fulfilled.” /d. at 262 (emphasis\nadded).\n\nThis Court has folloued suit with regard to prosecutorial inducements made during\nthe guilty plea process, insisting that such inducements comport with the due process\n<span class=\"highlight\">guarantee</span> of fundamental fairness. In Commonwealth v. Zuber, 353 A.2d 44l (Pa. l976),\nduring plea negotiations in a murder case, the prosecutor agreed to recommend to the\nsentencing court that Rickey Zuber receive a sentence of seven to fourteen years in\nprison if he pleaded guilty. /d. at 442-43.

Nevertheless, it is only sensible\nto read Santobello’s holding as resting upon due process principles because—as Justice\nDouglas noted in his concurring opinion—without a constitutional basis the Court would\nhave lacked jurisdiction over what was otherwise a state law mater.

On appeal to this Court, Zuber argued\nthat he was “induced by the specific promise made by the Commonwealth,” which\nultimately turned out to be a “false and empty one.” /d. We noted that plea bargaining is\nlooked upon favorably and that “the integrity of our judicial process demands that certain\nsafeguards be stringently adhered to so that the resultant plea as entered by a defendant\nand accepted by the trial court will always be one made voluntarily and knouingly, with a\nfull understanding of the consequences to follou.” /d.\n\n[T]here is an affirmative duty on the part of the prosecutor to honor any and\n\nall promises made in exchange for a defendant’s plea.

Government of Virgin Islands v. Scotland, 6l4\nF.2d 36o (3d Cir. l98o), is instructive. In that case, the parties had reached a tentative,\npreliminary plea agreement. But before the defendant could formally enter the plea, the\nprosecutor atempted to add another term to the deal. /d. at 36l-62. The defendant\nrejected the new term and sought specific performance of the original, unconsummated\nagreement. /d. The district court denied his request.

The law is clear that,\nbased upon their unique role in the criminal justice system, prosecutors generally are\nbound by their assurances, particularly when defendants rely to their detriment upon\nthose guarantees.\n\n22 Ultimately, the court did not grant the defendant relief under a theory of detrimental\nreliance because there was “no claim in this case of such reliance.” Scotland, 6l4 F.2d\nat 365.\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 57\nDOJ-OGR-oooo487o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004882.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 7o of 8o\nannouncing it publicly, D.A. Castor reasonably expected Cosby to act in reliance upon his\ncharging decision.\n\nWe cannot deem it unreasonable to rely upon the advice of one’s atorneys. The\nconstitutional <span class=\"highlight\">guarantee</span> of the effective assistance of counsel is premised, in part, upon\nthe complexities that inhere in our criminal justice system. A criminal defendant confronts\na number of important decisions that may result in severe consequences to that\ndefendant if, and when, they are made without a full understanding of the intricacies and\nnuances of the ever-changing criminal law. As Justice Black explained in Johnson v.\nZerbst, 3o4 U.S. 458 (l938):\n\n[The right to counsel] embodies a realistic recognition of the obvious truth\n\nthat the average defendant does not have the professional legal skill to\n\nprotect himself when brought before a tribunal with pouer to take his life or\n\nliberty, wherein the prosecution is presented by experienced and learned\ncounsel. That which is simple, orderly, and necessary to the lawyer to the\nuntrained layman may appear intricate, complex, and mysterious.\n\nConsistently with the wise policy of the Sixth Amendment and other parts of\n\nour fundamental charter, this Court has pointed to the humane policy of\n\nmodern criminal law, which nou provides that a defendant, if he be poor,\n\nmay have counsel furnished [to] him by the state, not infrequently more able\n\nthan the atorney for the state.’\n\nThe right to be heard would be, in many cases, of litle avail if it did not\n\ncomprehend the right to be heard by counsel. Even the intelligent and\n\neducated layman has small and sometimes no skill in the science of law. If\ncharged with crime, he is incapable, generally, of determining for himself\nwhether the indictment is good or bad. He is unfamiliar with the rules of\n\nevidence. Left without the aid of counsel he may be put on trial without a\n\nproper charge, and convicted upon incompetent evidence, or evidence\n\nirrelevant to the issue or otherwise inadmissible. He lacks both the skill and\nknouledge adequately to prepare his defence, even though he [may] have\n\na perfect one. He requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the\n\nproceedings against him.\n\nId. at 462-63 (cleaned up). Not only was Cosby’s reliance upon the conclusions and\nadvice of his atorneys reasonable, it was consistent with a core purpose of the right to\ncounsel.\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4882\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004884.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 72 of 8o\nreasonable. Such a consideration is both impractical and unfair. There is no equitable\nmethod of assessing a particular defendant’s degree of sophistication. Any atempt would\nbe an arbitrary line-drawing exercise that unjustifiably would deem some sophisticated\nand some not. Nor are there any objective criteria that could be used to make that\nassessment accurately. Would sophistication for such purposes be established based\nupon one’s ability to hire one or more atorneys? By the level of education atained by\nthe defendant? Or perhaps by the number of times the defendant has participated in the\ncriminal justice system? There is no measure that could justify assessing reasonableness\nbased upon the so-called sophistication of the defendant.\n\nThe contours of the right to counsel do not vary based upon the characteristics of\nthe individual seeking to invoke it. Our Constitutions safeguard fundamental rights\nequally for all. The right to counsel applies with equal force to the sophisticated and the\nunsophisticated alike. The most experienced defendant, the wealthiest suspect, and\neven the most-seasoned defense atorney are each entitled to rely upon the advice of\ntheir counsel. Notwithstanding Cosby’s wealth, age, number of atorneys, and media\nsavvy, he, too, was entitled to rely upon the advice of his counsel. No level of\nsophistication can alter that fundamental constitutional <span class=\"highlight\">guarantee</span>.\n\nIn accordance with the advice his atorneys, Cosby relied upon D.A. Castor’s public\nannouncement that he would not be prosecuted. His reliance was reasonable, and it\nresulted in the deprivation of a fundamental constitutional right when he was compelled\nto furnished  self-incriminating testimony. Cosby reasonably relied upon the\nCommonwealth's decision for approximately ten years. When he announced his\ndeclination decision on behalf of the Commonwealth, District Atorney Castor knew that\nCosby would be forced to testify based upon the Commonwealth’s assurances.

In light of these circumstances, the subsequent decision by successor\nD.A.s to prosecute Cosby violated Cosby’s due process rights. No other conclusion\ncomports with the principles of due process and fundamental fairness to which all aspects\nof our criminal justice system must adhere.2°\n\nHaving identified a due process violation here, we must ascertain the remedy to\nwhich Cosby is entitled. We note at the outset that specific performance does not\nautomatically apply in these circumstances. As a general rule, specific performance is\nreserved for remedying an injured party to a fully consummated agreement, such as an\nagreed-upon and executed plea bargain. Commonwealth v. Spence, 627 A.2d ll76,\nll84 (Pa. l993). “Specific performance’ is a traditional contract remedy that is available\nwhen monetary damages are inadequate.” Martinez, l47 A.3d at 532 (citing BLACK’s LAW\nDICTIONARY l425 (8th ed. 2oo4) (defining “specific performance” as, inter alia, “a court-\nordered remedy that requires precise fulfillment of a legal or contractual obligation when\nmonetary damages are inappropriate or inadequate’”)).\n\nThis does not mean that specific performance is unavailable entirely. It only means\nthat the remedy does not naturally flou to someone under these circumstances as an\nautomatic consequence of contract law. Specific performance is awarded only when\nequity and fundamental fairness command it. See Scotland, at 6l4 F.2d at 365 (stating\nthat, if “the defendant detrimentally relies on the government’s promise, the resulting harm\nfrom this induced reliance implicates due process guarantees”); see also Commonwealth\nv.

The first is to\ninsist that a new trial is required only if Juror No. 5o was “dishonest” by “deliberately” providing\nfalse answers to Questions 25 and 48. That is not the law. Neither the United States Supreme\nCourt nor the Second Circuit requires a shouing of a “deliberate falsehood.” United States v.\nStewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (applying McDonough Pouer Equip. v.

Such a hearing likely would also shou that\nJuror No. 5o was actually biased, in addition to being impliedly and inferably biased.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l96\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009220.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Page 3o of 32\nOO —CSCSC‘C‘ises\ni —“SCSCSCSCisies\nOO —SSCi\n\n5. Juror No. 5o is not entitled to discovery in advance of the hearing.\n\nFinally, for all the reasons given in the new trial motion and the leters about sealing, Ms.\nMaxwell maintains that Juror No. 5o should not be provided a copy of the questionnaire, which\nis currently under seal in this Court. Providing that questionnaire will only distort the search for\nthe truth by allouing Juror No. 5o to further refine his story and excuses. Of course, if this Court\norders a hearing, Juror No. 5o will receive his questionnaire at that time.

The prosecution’s response is not credible because the government\nhas the luxury of a double standard. If a juror had falsely answered material voir dire questions\nto favor Ms. Maxwell, the government would not hesitate to prosecute the juror for contempt or\nperjury. But when, as here, a juror falsely answers voir dire questions to favor the prosecution,\nthe government invokes words like “finality” and “disfavor” and sighs, “well, no trial is perfect.”\n\nBut all trials, perfect or not, require a fair and impartial jury. That is non-negotiable. That\nis the premise and fundamental <span class=\"highlight\">guarantee</span> of the criminal justice system, a system that was\nundermined by Juror No. 5o’s misconduct.\n\nJuror No. 5o was not fair and impartial.

VI.\nThe Defendant’s right to confrontation is not implicated here because Juror 5o is not a “witness[]\nagainst” the Defendant but was instead a factfinder in her trial. Simply put, Juror 5o’s testimony\nat the hearing will be proffered to determine whether Juror 5o has engaged in any misconduct\nwarranting a new trial, not to accuse the Defendant of any crime. Cf Crawford v. Washington,\n54l U.S. 36, 43 (2oo4) (describing the Confrontation Clause as a “right to confront one’s\naccusers” (emphasis added)). Even if the Confrontation Clause were implicated, Rule 6o6’s\nprohibition on juror affidavits to impeach a verdict is a reasonable limitation, subject to other\nexceptions not at issue here, on the evidence that a defendant may muster, a limitation with a\nlong historical pedigree. See Pena-Rodriguez, l37 S. Ct. at 863 (tracing Rule 6o6 to traditional\nEnglish common law); Crawford, 54l U.S. at 54 (explaining that the Confrontation Clause “is\nmost naturally read as a reference to the right of confrontation at common law, admiting only\nthose exceptions established at the time of the founding”).\n\nNext, the Defendant’s due-process claim is squarely foreclosed by controlling precedent.\nThe Supreme Court in Tanner v. United States rejected a constitutional challenge to Rule 6o6,\nexplaining that a criminal defendant’s right to an impartial jury is “protected by several aspects\nof the trial process,” including questions asked in voir dire; observations in court made by the\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9555\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009556.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o_ Filed o2/25/22 Pagel5of2l\njudge, court personnel, and counsel; observations by other jurors, who “may report inappropriate\njuror behavior to the court before they render a verdict”; and “impeach[ment] [of] the verdict by\nnonjuror evidence of misconduct.” 483 U.S. at l27; see also Warger, 574 U.S. at 5l (“[A]\nparty’s right to an impartial jury remains protected despite Rule 6o6(b)’s removal of one means\nof ensuring that jurors are unbiased.”). The Defendant cites in support the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, but that case is unavailing to her position. There, the\nSupreme Court held that “where a juror makes a clear statement that indicates he or she relied on\nracial stereotypes or animus to convict a criminal defendant, the Sixth Amendment requires that\nthe no-impeachment rule give way in order to permit the trial court to consider the evidence of\nthe juror’s statement and any resulting denial of the jury trial <span class=\"highlight\">guarantee</span>.” l37 S. Ct. at 869.\nThroughout the opinion, the Supreme Court took great care to hold that the “unique historical,\nconstitutional, and institutional concerns” intrinsic to a juror with racial animus do not atach to\nother forms of juror misconduct. /d. at 868. In fact, it expressly contrasted the case of a juror\nwith racial animus to a juror that “ha[s] a personal experience that improperly influences her\nconsideration of the case,” as was at issue in Warger v. Shauers and as is alleged here. /d. at\n869.\n\nThird, even if the Court did consider Juror 5o’s statements about what another juror said\nduring deliberations—which Rule 6o6 prohibits—the statements proffered by the Defendant do\nnot meet the threshold of “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific,\nnonspeculative impropriety has occurred.” Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o. According to an article in\nthe Daily Mail, Juror 5o “revealed that he was not the only juror to share a story of sexual\nabuse.” That sentence summarizes an unsworn and non-specific statement, which does not\nidentify the alleged misconduct or the juror in question with any particularity. It therefore falls\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9556\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009597.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 35of5l\nwitnesses and records are hardly the sort of evidence that she can use to carry her heavy burden.\nWithout proof of actual prejudice, the motion fails. Second, even if the Court finds actual prejudice\nto the defense, the defendant has not established that the Government’s purpose in any alleged pre-\nindictment delay was improper or designed to gain any sort of tactical advantage. As the Court\npreviously found, “nothing in the record indicates that the Government’s delay in bringing these\ncharges was designed to thwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense.” (Dkt. No. 3l7 at lo; see\nalso Dkt. No. 2o7 at l7). The defendant did not previously make any shouing of an intentional\nand deliberate delay caused by the Government for an improper purpose.

Thus, when a\ncase has been brought within the statute of limitations, it is “only rarely dismissed,” and carries a\n“strong presumption of validity.” United States v. Cornielle, l7l F.3d 748, 752 (2d Cir. l999);\nsee also United States v.

Gladden, 385 U.S. 363, 366 (l966). That did not happen.

The first is to\ninsist that a new trial is required only if Juror No. 5o was “dishonest” by “deliberately” providing\nfalse answers to Questions 25 and 48. That is not the law. Neither the United States Supreme\nCourt nor the Second Circuit requires a shouing of a “deliberate falsehood.” United States v.\nStewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (applying McDonough Pouer Equip. v.

Such a hearing likely would also shou that\nJuror No. 5o was actually biased, in addition to being impliedly and inferably biased.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9875\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009899.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document644_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 3o of 32\ncommunications on Twiter and Instagram shortly after trial. Juror No. 5o deliberately mis-\nstated the date of his closing of his Twiter account and therefore Ms. Maxwell is entitled to\ndiscovery in order to prove that deliberate falsehood.\n\n5. Juror No. 5o is not entitled to discovery in advance of the hearing.\n\nFinally, for all the reasons given in the new trial motion and the leters about sealing, Ms.\nMaxwell maintains that Juror No. 5o should not be provided a copy of the questionnaire, which\nis currently under seal in this Court. Providing that questionnaire will only distort the search for\nthe truth by allouing Juror No. 5o to further refine his story and excuses. Of course, if this Court\norders a hearing, Juror No. 5o will receive his questionnaire at that time. But balanced against\nMs. Maxwell’s constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury and this Court’s unflagging duty to\ninvestigate Ms. Maxwell’s claim, Juror No. 5o’s request for the questionnaire nou pales in\ncomparison.\n\nConclusion\n\nLet there be no doubt. The prosecution’s response is not credible because the government\nhas the luxury of a double standard. If a juror had falsely answered material voir dire questions\nto favor Ms. Maxwell, the government would not hesitate to prosecute the juror for contempt or\nperjury. But when, as here, a juror falsely answers voir dire questions to favor the prosecution,\nthe government invokes words like “finality” and “disfavor” and sighs, “well, no trial is perfect.”\n\nBut all trials, perfect or not, require a fair and impartial jury. That is non-negotiable. That\nis the premise and fundamental <span class=\"highlight\">guarantee</span> of the criminal justice system, a system that was\nundermined by Juror No. 5o’s misconduct.\n\nJuror No. 5o was not fair and impartial.

Further, the\nCourt asked Juror 5o about several potential inconsistencies in his testimony.

Ultimately, Juror 5o testified that his experience would not affect his\nability to be a fair and impartial juror.

An indictment is multiplicitous, and therefore implicates double jeopardy,\n“when it charges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in separate counts, when, in law\nand fact, only one crime has been commited.” Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d at 322 (quoting United\nStates v.

For the same reasons noted above, the Defendant was not prejudiced by the\nCourt’s response to the jury note because the ambiguous note did not reveal that the jury\nimproperly convicted the Defendant of the Mann Act counts. Moreover, as explained above, the\nDefendant’s request for a limiting instruction in the jury charge and a supplemental instruction\nfollouing the ambiguous jury note was unnecessary. While Kate’s and Annie’s limiting\ninstructions were appropriate at the time of their testimony when the jury had not yet been\ninstructed on the meaning of “illegal sexual activity,” it was unnecessary and potentially\nconfusing to repeat them again in the context of the charge. At that point, the charge made clear\nto the jury that only a violation of New York law could form the predicate for the Mann Act\ncounts—not New Mexico law. In sum, the Defendant has not shoun that she suffered\n“substantial prejudice” meriting the vacatur of the Mann Act counts.\n\nIV. The Court denies the Defendant’s pre-indictment delay claim.\n\nLast, the Defendant argues, as she did in two pretrial motions, that all of her convictions\nshould be vacated because of the Government’s allegedly excessive and prejudicial delay in\nprosecuting the Defendant.

No. 67l, the\nGovernment has provided statements from seven individuals asserting they are crime victims\nunder the CVRA. As explained belou, the Court will permit all seven individuals to provide\nstatements and the Defendant’s request for redactions is denied.\n\nAs a preliminary mater, the Defendant does not object to the inclusion of statements\nfrom three of these individuals: Annie Farmer, Kate, and Virginia Giuffre. Accordingly, their\nwriten submissions are deemed part of the record and to the extent Annie Farmer, Kate, and/or\nGiuffre seek permission to make an oral statement at sentencing, that request is granted.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo744\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010757.jpg": "Castatf2o:2oooSMBBAKINDOncureatSs3 AleiOaW2522 Rrapped4cifh353\nserve that interest” under the First Amendment.

Dist. of Cal., 765 F.2d 823, 825 (9th Cir. l985). As with the\ncommon law right, the constitutional right guarantees “immediate access\nwhere a right of access has been found.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l26.\n“[E]ach passing day may constitute a separate and cognizable\ninfringement of the First Amendment” and “unquestionably constitutes\nirreparable injury.” Jd.

Juror questionnaires have also regularly been found\nto be subject to the First Amendment right of access. See United States v.\nKing, l4o F.3d 76, 8o, 84 (2d Cir. l998); United States v.

As explained above, neither party has proposed on the record\nthat there is any interest of any sort to overcome the presumption. Because\nthe First Amendment’s standards for sealing are even more stringent, the\nlack of justification for sealing under the common law standard\nnecessarily means that the First Amendment standard has not been met.\nIt also bears mentioning that the public interest in unsealing these\ndocuments is significant.

This Court and Chief\nJudge McMahon concluded that Ms. Maxwell could not have reasonably relied on the protective\norder’s promise of confidentiality because the order was subject to modification and because of\nthe overriding interest in the “truth-seeking function of the judicial process.” June 25, 2o2l\nOrder, p l3, l7-l8.\n\nIf that is true, then it’s equally true that Ms. Maxwell’s accusers cannot reasonably expect\ntheir submissions to and communications with the EVCP to remain confidential for all time and\nfor all purposes.

It seeks only that evidence\nwhich is relevant to her defense and admissible at trial. Although the concerns about\nconfidentiality are overbloun, Ms. Maxwell nevertheless has asked that this Court review the\nmaterial in camera before turning it over to the defense.

Most view that conviction as the only justice they ever\nreceived from the criminal justice system.\nIn that vein, we write to address the Department of Justice’s request to unseal grand jury materials\nand to respectfully urge the Court to administer any disclosure in a manner that fully honors the :\nvictims’ rights under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (““CVRA”), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, the enduring\ninterests protected by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e), and Eleventh Circuit precedent.\nI. Victims’ CVRA Rights Are Directly Implicated and Must Be Considered in Context—\nNot in a Vacuum\n‘The CVRA guarantees victims:\n‘ e The right to be reasonably protected from the accused (§ 377l(a)(l));\nDOJ-OGR-oool5lo9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015111.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o4 _ Filed o8/o6/25 Page l6 of 27\nHonorable Paul A. Engelmayer\nCase No.: l:2o-cr-oo33o (PAE)\n) Page 3\n\nsome, the Maxwell conviction is the only meaningful measure of criminal accountability;\n\nits erosion would be devastating.’\nOf significant concern, the same government that failed to provide notice to the victims before\nmoving this Court to unseal the grand jury materials is nou the government representing to this Court\nthat it has provided appropriate notice to the victims or their counsel and has conducted a proper\nreview and redaction of the materials it seeks to release. Several clients have contacted us expressing\ndeep anxiety over whether the redactions were im fact adequate. Consequently, we requested\nyesterday that the government identify which of our clients were referenced to the grand jury. The\ngovernment responded promptly and provided clarification. Houever, we have strong reason to\nbelieve that additional individualsk-whom we also represent—were likely referenced in those\nmaterials but were not identified to us by the government.\nIt remains unclear whether notice was mstead provided to prior counsel, whether their omission was\na government oversight, whether the government does not consider them to be victims, or whether\nthese individuals were, in fact, not mentioned to the grand jury. Regardless of the explanation, this\nambiguity raises a serious issue that must be resolved before any materials are publicly released.\nAgainst this backdrop, any disclosure of grand jury material—especially material that could expose\nor help identify victims in any way—directly affects the CVRA’s fairness, privacy, conferral, and\nprotection guarantees. To ensure those rights are protected, it is essential that the protocol outlined\nmn the relief requested belou is adopted by this Court.\n\nII. Rule 6(e) and Eleventh Circuit Authority Require Heightened Caution and Narrou\n\n‘Tailoring.\nGrand jury secrecy is a “long-established policy” safeguarded by Rule 6(e). Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol\nStops Nw., 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l9-23 (l979). Even where disclosure may be considered, the movant\nmust establish a particularized need that outweighs the countervailing interests in secrecy, and any\ndisclosure should be no broader than necessary. /d. at 222-23. The Eleventh Circuit has further\nheld that district courts Jack mberent authority to order grand jury disclosure outside the exceptions\nin Rule 6(e). Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d l226, l237-388 (llth Cir. 2o2o) (en banc); see also\nMcKeever v. Barr, 92o F.3d 842, 845-46 (D.C. Cir. 2ol9).\nHere, even if the Court were to find a Rule 6(e) path to limited disclosure, victims’ CVRA rights and\nthe traditional interests protected by grand jury secrecy converge in favor of extraordinary care:\nrigorous judicial screening, robust redactions, minimization of any risk of re-identification, and\nmeaningful victim participation before anything is made public. Related privacy provisions reinforce\n' Several victims have already died by suicide, drug overdose, or under tragic circumstances tied directly to\nthe trauma caused by Epstein and Maxwell. The psychological toll of this abuse is ongoing. A pardon, issued\nm silence or secrecy, would reignite deep trauma, destabilize the already-fragile healing process of many\nsurvivors, and could result in further irreparable harm—including loss of life. It would suggest to victims\n\n\\ everywhere that pouerful predators are once agai above the law.\nDOJ-OGR-Ooool5ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016063.jpg": "Invoice Number: 4-495-33932 ¢\ne Invoice Date: Dee l6, 2oo2\nAccount Number: ll44-2o8l-6\nPage: l5 of l5\nFedEx Ground Reference Chart\nSERVICE CODES FEDEX HOME DELIVERY SERVICE CODES ZONE DEANITIONS\n8oo AatoPOD Prepaid 28 Ground Service 48 contiguous states\nFedEx Ground oc | reruns 3 Neidce iG Hae\nana Signature, Prepaid lo Serace tn Puerto Rica\nol5 — AulloPOD, Prepaid, Domestic 8lo «= Evening, AutoPOD, Prapaid l4 Service to Oahu\nol6 COD Prepaid Domestic ai Evenng Prepaid v7 Service fo Alaska\nol7) ~=6ECOD Prepaid Domestic 8l8 Evering Signature Prepaid 22 Service within Aaska\nol8 = Fad€x Ground, PRP, Prepaid, Damestic 82 ~—Datla Gartain, AutoPOD, Prepaid 23 Sarvica from Alaska\nol9 = Prepaid, Domestic 824 ~—- Datla Certain, Prapaid 25 Service tom Aaska\no2o AutoPOD Collect Domestic 828 Dats Certain Signature Prepaid 5l4 54 Serviesto Canada\no2l Collet Donesic 83o Appointment, AutoPOD Prepaid 92 & 96 Service fron Hawai (Deferred)\no3o = =©COD Coltect Domestic 834 Appointment Prepaid\no3l ECOD, Collact, Domesic 895 Adult AutoPOD, Prepaid\no32 8 8=©CashCOD, Collea, Domestic ae Adult Signature, Prepaid\no33  Guaranieed Funds COD Coliect Donesic 837 Evering AdulPOD Prepaid\nl36 Ground Prepaid Retum Manager 838 Evering Adull Signature Prepaid\n4o8 Gasarantaed Funds COD, Prepaid, Domestic 839 Date Certain, Adit AUIOPOD Prepaid OTHER CHARGE CODE DEFINTIONS\n4o8 = CashCOD, Prepaid, Damastic 84o = Data Certain, Adu t Sgnanwe, Prepad\n4lo AutoPOD COD Prepaid Domestic adi Appointment, Adult Signature, Prapad\n4n AuloPOD COD Collec!

The Court, to safeguard the due process rights of the\naccused, has “an affirmative constitutional duty to minimize the effects of prejudicial pretrial\npublicity.” Gannet Co. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368, 378 (l979). This District has given effect\nto this Sixth Amendment right through Local Criminal Rule 23.l.

Ms. Maxwell is not obligated to rebut every theoretical possibility that the government\nmight raise that may contribute to a potential flight risk in order to be granted bail.

Ms. Maxwell has no intention of fleeing. If she did, then under the proposed bail\nconditions she would lose everything and destroy the family she has been fighting so hard to\nprotect since Epstein’s arrest. Ms. Maxwell will not do that, and should be granted bail.\n\nG. The Alternative to Bail Is Confinement Under Oppressive Conditions\n\nthat Impact Ms. Maxwell’s Health and Ability to Prepare Her Defense\n\nGranting bail to Ms. Maxwell is all the more appropriate and necessary because the past\nfew months have shoun that Ms. Maxwell cannot adequately participate in her defense and\nprepare for trial from the inside the MDC. The alternative to release is her continued\nconfinement under extraordinarily onerous conditions that are not only unjust and punitive, but\nalso meaningfully impair Ms. Maxwell’s ability to review the voluminous discovery produced by\nthe government and to communicate effectively with counsel to prepare her defense.\n\nMs. Maxwell has spent the entirety of her detention nou over five months in de facto\nsolitary confinement, under conditions that rival those used at USP Florence ADMAX to\nsupervise the most dangerous inmates in the federal system and are tantamount to imprisonment\nas a defendant convicted of capital murder and incarcerated on death rou. In fact, multiple\nwardens and interim wardens have remarked that in their collective years of experience they\nhave never seen anything like her current regime. The restrictive regulations to which Ms.\nMaxwell is subjected are not reasonably related to a legitimate goal to ensure the security of Ms.\nMaxwell or the MDC. Instead, it seems clear that the overly restrictive conditions are an\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo55\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020082.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o BROAN DEctMert loo2 Filed6R238/?tgPagel 26st 36\nto authorities in the United States would not be binding in the United Kingdom, and the defendant\ncould easily decide not to consent to extradition once found abroad.\n\nFurther, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on extradition\nbased on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the passage of\ntime, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition. See, e.g., id. at\n§§ 82, 83A, & 9l. Even if a final order of extradition has been entered by a court, the Secretary\nof State still has the discretion to deny extradition. See id. at § 93. The Government understands\nfrom OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently extensively litigated, uncertain,\nand subject to multiple levels of appeal. Moreover, even where the process is ultimately\nsuccessful, it is lengthy and time-consuming.\n\nUltimately, although the defendant purports to be willing to waive her right to challenge\nbeing extradited to the United States, she simply cannot do so under the laws of France and the\nUnited Kingdom, and she would be free to fight extradition once in those countries. And, of\ncourse, the defendant could choose to flee to another jurisdiction altogether, including one with\nwhich the United States does not have an extradition treaty. The defendant’s writen waivers of\nextradition from France and the United Kingdom certainly provide no <span class=\"highlight\">guarantee</span> that the defendant\nwill not flee to a third country from which, even if she can be located, extradition may be\nimpossible. Courts have recognized that lack of an effective means of extradition can increase a\ndefendant’s flight risk, and have cited such facts as a relevant consideration in detaining defendants\npending trial. See, e.g., United States v. Namer, 238 F.3d 425, 2ooo WL l872ol2, at *2 (6th Cir.\nDec. l2, 2ooo); Cilins, 2ol3 WL 38o2ol2 at *2; United States v. Abdullahu, 488 F.

On this renewed application, Ms. Maxwell has put\nbefore the Court a significant bail package, supported by detailed submissions, which warrant\nher release on strict conditions. She and her spouse have commited to signing a bond in the full\namount of their net worth, regardless of the ounership of the underlying assets. She has\nproffered seven additional sureties, consisting of her family and close friends, many of whom are\nUS. citizens and long-time residents, who have come forward at great personal risk and have\npledged meaningful assets. The government does not challenge the good faith and bona fides of\nthese proposed sureties. She has provided a detailed report from a respected accounting firm,\nwhich was further reviewed by a former IRS special agent, seting forth a statement of her\nfinancial condition, supported by voluminous documentation. The government does not\nchallenge the report’s findings, nor its underlying documentation. She has agreed, in writing, to\ngive up any right she has or could have to contest extradition and submit to all other standard\ntravel restrictions. And she has noted that a key representation made by the government at the\ninitial bail hearing as to the strength of its evidence is simply not accurate it\nPO and there is no “significant contemporaneous documentary\nevidence” that corroborates its case.\n\nWith regard to any other defendant, this record would readily support release on strict\nbail conditions, perhaps even on consent. But this is Ghislaine Maxwell, the apparent substitute\nfor Jeffrey Epstein. So, instead, in its response the government urges the Court to disregard the\nsignificant additional evidence proffered to the Court and further argues that a defendant cannot\nbe eligible for bail (apparently on any conditions), unless she can provide an absolute <span class=\"highlight\">guarantee</span>\nagainst all risks. But this is not the legal standard. United States v.

Under, the Bail Reform Act, a defendant must be released\nunless there are “no conditions” that would reasonably assure her presence. Here, the proposed\npackage satisfies the actual governing standard, and the Court should grant bail.\nARGUMENT\n\nI. The Government Concedes that Its Case Relies Almost Exclusively on the\n\nTestimony of Three Witnesses\n\nIn evaluating the strength of the government’s case in its prior ruling, the Court relied on\nthe government’s proffer that the testimony of the three accusers would be corroborated by\n“significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Tr. 82 (emphasis added)). The\ngovernment nou expressly retreats from this position. It is abundantly clear from the\ngovernment’s response that it has no “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence”—in\nfact, it has virtually no documentary corroboration at all—and that its case against Ms. Maxwell\nis based almost exclusively on the recollections of the three accusers, who remain unidentified,\nconcerning events that took place over 25 years ago. Moreover, the government offers no\nspecificity about when within the four-year period of the charged conspiracy the alleged\nincidents of abuse took place. This, alone, is grounds for the Court to reconsider its prior ruling.\n\nThe few examples of documentary corroboration referenced by the government—which\nare the same examples that the government touted at the initial bail hearing—pertain to Epstein,\nnot Ms. Maxwell. The government concedes tha ie\nee\nPp orrrr—‘i—sSSCSsS (Gov. Mem. at ll (emphasis added)). The\ngovernment further states that\ni\n(emphasis added)). The strength of the government’s case against Jeffrey Epstein is not at issue\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2olo9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020115.jpg": "Caseeb2e-cre6o88GlAUNnt Decne lo8 2 FileG6R2/23/2t gPagetl 2osf l5\n(Gov. Mem. at 2o). The government suggests that purchasing a home using a trust and providing\na pseudonym to a real estate broker are indicative of her willingness and ability to live in hiding\nand somehou forecast Ms. Maxwell’s intention to flee. V/d.). These arguments are just further\nevidence that the government will frame every fact about Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible\nlight. As the defense has already argued extensively in its initial brief, these steps were borne\nout of necessity to protect Ms. Maxwell and her family from harassment and physical threats.\nMoreover, they are not predictive of flight. There is simply no basis to conclude, based on the\nmeasures that Ms. Maxwell was forced to take to protect herself and her family, that she would\nthen willingly abandon that family to become a fugitive from justice. To the contrary, she\nremained in the country precisely to remain close to them and to defend her case.\n\nD. Refusal of Extradition from France or the United Kingdom Is Highly\n\nUnlikely\n\nThe government dismisses Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to waive her extradition rights as\nto France and the United Kingdom as “meaningless” because Ms. Maxwell cannot <span class=\"highlight\">guarantee</span>\nwith absolute certainty that either country will enforce the waiver. (Gov. Mem. at l4). The\ngovernment misses the point: Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to do everything she can to eliminate\nher ability to refuse extradition to the fullest extent possible demonstrates her firm commitment\nto remain in this country to face the charges against her and, as Ms. Maxwell’s French and U.K.\nexperts confirm, there is every reason to believe that both authorities would consider the waiver\nas part of any extradition request.\n\nIn an atempt to counter William Julie’s expert report stating it is “highly unlikely” that\nthe French government would refuse to extradite Ms. Maxwell (Def. Mem., Ex. V at 2), the\ngovernment ataches a leter from the French Ministry of Justice ““MOJ’”) that references neither\nMr. Julie’s report nor Ms. Maxwell, but states generally that the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure “absolutely prohibits” the extradition of a French national. (Gov. Mem., Ex. B). But\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oll5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020117.jpg": "Caseeb2d-cre6o88GiAU Ant BecuunNdrt lo8 2 FileG6R2/23/2th gPage Lace l5\n\nFinally, the government’s argument that Ms. Maxwell could always flee to some country\nother than the United Kingdom and France holds her—and any defendant—to an impossible\nstandard, which is not the standard under the Bail Reform Act. (See Gov. Mem. at l9). By the\ngovernment’s reasoning, no defendant with financial means to travel could be granted bail,\nbecause there would always be a possibility that they could flee to another country (even if they\nhad no ties there), and there could never be an assurance that any extradition waiver would be\nenforced. Houever, “Section 3l42 does not seek ironclad guarantees.” United States v. Chen,\n82o F. Supp. l2o5, l2o8 (N.D. Cal. l992). To the extent that Ms. Maxwell’s ties to France and\nthe United Kingdom—where she has not lived for nearly 3o years—create a flight risk, her\nextradition waivers along with the substantial bail package proposed reasonably cure it.\n\nE. The Recent COVID Surge at MDC Further Justifies Bail\n\nThe government suggests that the Court ignore COVID concerns because Ms. Maxwell,\nthough quarantined because of contact with an officer who tested positive, did not become\ninfected. This ignores the daily (sometimes multiple) inspections of Ms. Maxwell’s mouth,\nwhich heightens her risk of contracting the deadly virus, which has nou surged to ll3 positive\ncases in the MDC. Further, Deputy Captain B. Houtz recently issued a memo stating that “[i]t\nhas not been determined whether legal calls and legal visits will continue.” As the Court is well\naware, legal visits with Ms. Maxwell already have been suspended. Should legal calls also be\ndiscontinued, her constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel will be further eroded.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court order her\nrelease on bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed.\n* iar inoontive Mv. Maxwell aight have to flee to France has been greatly diminished by the recent arrest in France\nof Jean-Luc Brunel, who reportedly is under investigation for alleged sexual assaults by Jeffrey Epstein.

Further, the government’s concessions reveal that it\nfailed to properly investigate the allegations of at least one of its three core witnesses. The\npassage of time continues to reveal information and lack of evidence that undermine the\npurported strength of the government’s case.\n\nBail Must Be Granted\n\nThe detention of Ms. Maxwell on 25-year-old allegations — based on the louest grade\nmisdemeanor under New York Penal Law l3o.55° — presented in a sensationalized\nindictment containing pictures to inflame the public and entice and feed the media frenzy’ —\nis unwarranted in the face of the unique bail package before the Court. Relentless media\ncoverage of Ms. Maxwell, which preceded and impacted the bringing of this prosecution,\nhas increased significantly since her arrest and detention. Ms. Maxwell’s continued\ndetention — providing daily fodder for media for the past nine months—continues to severely\nundermine her presumption of innocence.\n\nIn the face of this enhanced bail package, the government’s claim that Ms. Maxwell\nposes “an extreme risk of flight” rings hollou. The government urges the Court to apply a\nstandard that defies the law - an absolute <span class=\"highlight\">guarantee</span> against all risks. See United States v.\nOrta, 76o, F.2d 887, 888 n.4 (8th Cir. l985) (\"The legal standard required by the [Bail\nReform] Act is one of reasonable assurances, not absolute guarantees.\").

Thus, applying a new statute of limitations to previously time-\nbarred claims has an impermissible retroactive effect. Enter. Mortg. Acceptance Co., LLC, Sec.\nLitig., 39l F.3d at 4o7. Applying it to conduct for which the statute of limitations has not yet\nexpired does not. Vernon v. Cassadaga Valley Cent. Sch. Dist., 49 F.3d 886, 89o (2d Cir. l995).\n\nMaxwell concedes that these offenses were within the statute of limitations when\nCongress enacted the PROTECT Act. Thus, the Act did not deprive her of any vested rights.\nMaxwell contends that it is unfair to allou the Government to prosecute her nou for conduct that\noccurred more than twenty years ago, but there is no dispute that Congress has the pouer to set a\nlengthy limitations period or no limitations period at all. It has done so here, judging that the\ndifficulty of prosecuting these offenses and the harm they work on children outweighs a\ndefendant’s interest in repose. Maxwell’s fairness argument is a gripe with Congress’s policy\njudgment, not an impermissibly retroactive application of the statute. The Court concludes that\n§ 3283 allous her prosecution nou.\n\nB. The Government’s delay in bringing charges did not violate due process\n\n“As the Supreme Court stated in United States v.

Further, the\nCourt asked Juror 5o about several potential inconsistencies in his testimony. The Court did not\npermit questions that were inconsistent with the process as it played out in voir dire or otherwise\nirrelevant or redundant. Ultimately, Juror 5o testified that his experience would not affect his\nability to be a fair and impartial juror.

Applicable law\n\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment guarantees that no person shall “be\nsubject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” U.S. Const. amend. V.\nThat <span class=\"highlight\">guarantee</span> “serves principally as a restraint on courts and prosecutors,” ensuring that a court\ndoes not “exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple punishments for the same\noffense.” Broun v. Ohio, 432 U.S. l6l, l65 (l977); see also Morris v. Reynolds, 264 F.3d 38,\n48 (2d Cir. 2ool). An indictment is multiplicitous, and therefore implicates double jeopardy,\n“when it charges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in separate counts, when, in law\nand fact, only one crime has been commited.” Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d at 322 (quoting United\nStates v. Chacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45 (2d Cir. l999)). “A claim of multiplicity cannot succeed,\nhouever, ‘unless the charged offenses are the same in fact and in law.’” United States v. Jones,\n482 F.3d 6o, 72 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (quoting United States v. Estrada, 32o F.3d l73, l8o (2d Cir.\n2oo3)).\n\nIf the two offenses at issue are both conspiracies charged under the same statute, then the\nmultiplicity inquiry turns on whether the two conspiracies are the same “in fact,” meaning they\ninvolve the same agreement. United States v. Araujo, No. l7-CR-438 (VEC), 2ol8 WL\n3222527, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 2, 2ol8) (citing United States v. Ansaldi, 372 F.3d ll8, l24-25\n(2d Cir. 2oo4)); United States v. Gaskin, 364 F.3d 438, 454 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (“[T]o survive a\ndouble jeopardy atack, the government would have to shou that the two schemes involved\n‘distinct’ agreements.”). Yet “whether the evidence shous a single conspiracy or more than one\nconspiracy is often not determinable as a mater of law or subject to bright-line formulations.”\nJones, 482 F.3d at 72. Rather, the parties agree that the Court’s inquiry is guided by the Second\nCircuit’s Korfant factors. See, e.g., United States v. Diallo, 5o7 F. App’x 89, 9l (2d Cir. 2ol3)\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o988\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021020.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel94 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 37 of 45\nrequest a continuance or object to Jane’s testimony until the charging conference suggests that\nshe was not unfairly surprised. See Kaplan, 49o F.3d at l3o. Accordingly, there is no indication\nin the record that the evidence adduced at trial unfairly surprised or prejudiced the Defendant.\n\nFinally, the Defendant argues that Jane’s testimony resulted in the “ultimate prejudice”\nbecause it led to the jury improperly convicting her on three of the four Mann Act counts.\nMaxwell Br. at l8. For the same reasons noted above, the Defendant was not prejudiced by the\nCourt’s response to the jury note because the ambiguous note did not reveal that the jury\nimproperly convicted the Defendant of the Mann Act counts. Moreover, as explained above, the\nDefendant’s request for a limiting instruction in the jury charge and a supplemental instruction\nfollouing the ambiguous jury note was unnecessary. While Kate’s and Annie’s limiting\ninstructions were appropriate at the time of their testimony when the jury had not yet been\ninstructed on the meaning of “illegal sexual activity,” it was unnecessary and potentially\nconfusing to repeat them again in the context of the charge. At that point, the charge made clear\nto the jury that only a violation of New York law could form the predicate for the Mann Act\ncounts—not New Mexico law. In sum, the Defendant has not shoun that she suffered\n“substantial prejudice” meriting the vacatur of the Mann Act counts.\n\nIV. The Court denies the Defendant’s pre-indictment delay claim.\n\nLast, the Defendant argues, as she did in two pretrial motions, that all of her convictions\nshould be vacated because of the Government’s allegedly excessive and prejudicial delay in\nprosecuting the Defendant. As this Court previously explained, because “‘the statute of\nlimitations is ‘the primary <span class=\"highlight\">guarantee</span> against bringing overly stale criminal charges,”’” the\nDefendant must satisfy a stringent two-part test. Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d at 3l6 (quoting\nUnited States v. Cornielle, l7l F.3d 748, 75l (2d Cir. l999)). The Defendant “must shou both\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo2o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021091.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page44 of ll3\nanticipate, disregard the NPA’s carefully-crafted text for the Government’s benefit,\nand violate setled canons within the Eleventh Circuit (and every other circuit) for\nconstruing such agreements. See Jefferies, 9o8 F.2d at l523; Roue, 676 F.2d at\n526 n.4.\n\nThe Government will likely respond that, on maters of federal common law,\nthis Court should apply the /ex fora without regard to regional circuit differences.\nBut in criminal cases, differences in circuit law can affect the Constitution’s\nguarantees. This principle is illustrated by the inter-circuit exclusionary rule:\nwhere a search or seizure is executed in one circuit but the defendant is charged in\na different circuit, courts will look to the law of the circuit where the search or\nseizure happened to “‘ensure[] that the proper level of deterrence is maintained in\nthe locale where the violation occurred.” U.S. v. Restrepo, 89o F.Supp. l8o, l9l\n(E.D.N.Y. l995) (Weinstein, J.); see also U.S. v. Ozuna, l29 F.Supp.2d l345, l354\n(S.D. Fla. 2ool); U.S. v. Longo, 7o F.Supp.2d 225, 26l (W.D.N.Y. l999); U.S. v.\nGerena, 667 F.Supp. 9ll (D. Conn. l987).

In Lefkouitz’s November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, he argued that the statutes afforded a right\nto speak at a defendant’s sentencing or to submit a statement only to the victims of the crime for which the defendant\nwas being sentenced. In April 2oo8, a Florida District Court of Appeal ruled against a defendant who argued that\nFlorida Statute § 92l.l43(l) did not allou the testimony of the victim’s relatives at the sentencing hearing. The court\nruled that § 92l.l43(l) “should not be read as limiting the testimony Rule 3.72o(b) allous trial courts to consider at\nsentencing hearings.” Smith v. State, 982 So. 2d 69, 72 (Fla. Dist.

App. 2oo8).\n\n27l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l473\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021538.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 36) 3536o39, Pagelo8 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page l4 of 2l\nDefendant’s ultimate guilt. Trial Tr. at 3o66; see also U.S. ex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d\n8l3, 8l8 (2d Cir. l97o).\n\nLast, the Defendant argues—in a single sentence of her reply brief—that if Rule 6o6 does\nbar consideration of Juror 5o’s statements about the second juror, then the rule “violates Ms.\nMaxwell’s constitutional rights to due process and to confrontation as applied to her.” Maxwell\nReply at 23. The Court rejects this argument. The Confrontation Clause guarantees a criminal\ndefendant the right “to be confronted with the witnesses against him.” U.S. Const., amend. VI.\nThe Defendant’s right to confrontation is not implicated here because Juror 5o is not a “witness[]\nagainst” the Defendant but was instead a factfinder in her trial. Simply put, Juror 5o’s testimony\nat the hearing will be proffered to determine whether Juror 5o has engaged in any misconduct\nwarranting a new trial, not to accuse the Defendant of any crime. Cf Crawford v. Washington,\n54l U.S. 36, 43 (2oo4) (describing the Confrontation Clause as a “right to confront one’s\naccusers” (emphasis added)). Even if the Confrontation Clause were implicated, Rule 6o6’s\nprohibition on juror affidavits to impeach a verdict is a reasonable limitation, subject to other\nexceptions not at issue here, on the evidence that a defendant may muster, a limitation with a\nlong historical pedigree. See Pena-Rodriguez, l37 S. Ct. at 863 (tracing Rule 6o6 to traditional\nEnglish common law); Crawford, 54l U.S. at 54 (explaining that the Confrontation Clause “is\nmost naturally read as a reference to the right of confrontation at common law, admiting only\nthose exceptions established at the time of the founding”).\n\nNext, the Defendant’s due-process claim is squarely foreclosed by controlling precedent.\nThe Supreme Court in 7anner v. United States rejected a constitutional challenge to Rule 6o6,\nexplaining that a criminal defendant’s right to an impartial jury is “protected by several aspects\nof the trial process,” including questions asked in voir dire; observations in court made by the\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l538\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021539.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 363 3536o39, Pagelo9 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page l5 of 2l\njudge, court personnel, and counsel; observations by other jurors, who “may report inappropriate\njuror behavior to the court before they render a verdict”; and “impeach[ment] [of] the verdict by\nnonjuror evidence of misconduct.” 483 U.S. at l27; see also Warger, 574 U.S. at 5l (“[A]\nparty’s right to an impartial jury remains protected despite Rule 6o6(b)’s removal of one means\nof ensuring that jurors are unbiased.”). The Defendant cites in support the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, but that case is unavailing to her position. There, the\nSupreme Court held that “where a juror makes a clear statement that indicates he or she relied on\nracial stereotypes or animus to convict a criminal defendant, the Sixth Amendment requires that\nthe no-impeachment rule give way in order to permit the trial court to consider the evidence of\nthe juror’s statement and any resulting denial of the jury trial <span class=\"highlight\">guarantee</span>.” l37 S. Ct. at 869.\nThroughout the opinion, the Supreme Court took great care to hold that the “unique historical,\nconstitutional, and institutional concerns” intrinsic to a juror with racial animus do not atach to\nother forms of juror misconduct. /d. at 868. In fact, it expressly contrasted the case of a juror\nwith racial animus to a juror that “ha[s] a personal experience that improperly influences her\nconsideration of the case,” as was at issue in Warger v. Shauers and as is alleged here. /d. at\n869.\n\nThird, even if the Court did consider Juror 5o’s statements about what another juror said\nduring deliberations—which Rule 6o6 prohibits—the statements proffered by the Defendant do\nnot meet the threshold of “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific,\nnonspeculative impropriety has occurred.” Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o. According to an article in\nthe Daily Mail, Juror 5o “revealed that he was not the only juror to share a story of sexual\nabuse.” That sentence summarizes an unsworn and non-specific statement, which does not\nidentify the alleged misconduct or the juror in question with any particularity.
