Sixth Amendment\nFinally, in a case such as this one, which will likely involve voluminous discovery and is\npredicated on events allegedly occurring l4 or more years ago, it is critical to counsel’s ability to\nprovide effective assistance, as well as the defendant’s ability to meaningfully contribute to his\ndefense, that Mr. Epstein be permited pretrial release. The Sixth Amendment “does not provide\nmerely that a defense shall be made for the accused; it grants to the accused personally the right\nto make his defense. It is the accused, not counsel, who must be ‘informed of the nature and\ncause of the accusation,’ and who must be ‘confronted with the witnesses against him,’ and who\nmust be accorded ‘compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.’” Fareta v.\nCalifornia, 422 U.S. 8o6, 8l9 (l975). Given the unique circumstances of this case, Mr.\nEpstein’s exercise of these important Constitutional rights would be materially impaired by his\npretrial detention.\nV. Conclusion\nWherefore, for all of the foregoing reasons, Mr. Epstein respectfully submits that his conduct\nover the past l4 years proves that he poses no risk of flight or threat to the safety of the\ncommunity.

Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 4\nARGUMENT\n\nThe Government respectfully submits that the defendant cannot overcome the statutory\n\npresumption in favor of detention in this case for the follouing reasons, among others:\nI. Victims Seek Detention\n\nPursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (““CVRA”), a crime victim has the right to be\nreasonably heard at certain public proceedings in the district court, including proceedings\ninvolving release. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4). Consistent with that requirement, the Government has\nbeen in contact with victims and counsel identified through this investigation in connection with\nthe argument regarding bail.\n\nMultiple victims and/or their counsel have asked the Government to seek detention (and to\ninform the Court of their views in that respect) for multiple reasons. First, they believe that the\ndefendant’s continued detention is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> under the CVRA’s right to be reasonably protected\nfrom the accused. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(l). They have specifically conveyed to the Government\nthat they would be fearful for their safety ifthe defendant were released. For the reasons articulated\nherein, the Government believes those concerns to be well-founded.\n\nAdditionally, certain victims have asked the Government to advise the Court that they are\nspecifically concerned about the defendant’s proposal to be released even if under conditions that\nincluded home detention and full-time private guards. They believe it would be unfair to victims\nof a wealthy defendant, like Epstein, if he were to be given greater freedoms than others would be\nin similar circumstances, and that such an arrangement would be inconsistent with their rights.\nThey specifically asked the Government to advise the Court that they believed such an arrangement\ncould result in harassment and abuse by the defendant. ?\n\nIl. The Defendant’s Proposal Does Nothing to Mitigate His Flight Risk\n\nEach of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncounsel strongly in favor of detention, and the defendant’s proposed package would do nothing\nwhatsoever to mitigate those risks.\n\nA. Defendant Proposes No Infringement Upon His Ability to Use his Vast Wealth to Flee\n\nIt might not be immediately apparent to a reader of the Release Motion that the defendant\nis extravagantly wealthy and worth, according to records relating to the defendant recently\nobtained by the Government from a financial institution (“Institution-l”), more than $5oo million.\n> The Government is aware of at least one additional atorney for a victim who has publicly stated\nthat her client supports the pretrial detention of the defendant. The Government is unaware of any\nvictim who has expressed support for the defendant being granted pretrial release on bail.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo332\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000431.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 22 Filed o7/l6/l9 Pagelof9\nLAW OFFICE OF\nMARC FERNICH\nMARC FERNICH maf@fernichlaw.com 8lo SEVENTH AVENUE, SUITE 62o\nALSO ADMITTED IN MASSACHUSETTS NEW YORK, NEW YORK lool9\n2l2-446-2346\nFAX: 2l2-459-2299\nwww.fernichlaw.com\nJuly l6, 2ol9\nBY ECF\nHon.

On l7 July\n2o25, after President Donald Trump publicly instructed Atorney General Pam Bondi to seek the\nCourt’s permission to release “any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, we filed a Freedom of\nInformation Act (“FOIA”) request with the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) for transcripts of ail\ngrand jury testimony from this case and United States v.

Judge Berman:\n\nI come forward to you today in disdain, disgust and fear of hou the United States of\nAmerica’s DOJ has handled the promise to release the “Epstein Files”. Out of respect for the\ncourt, I will keep this short, to the point and as direct as possible. It has been a very difficult time\nfor me personally, mentally and emotionally dealing with the circus around the “Epstein Files”. I\nuse quotations because what are these “Files” exactly, anyway?”\n\nI regretably feel the need to come forward and shed some light on the Government’s\nmotion to unseal transcripts, documents and exhibits from the “case” that was never tried. Sad to\nsay, for the victims we never got our day in court. Apparently, Epstein killed himself under\nwhose watch? Oh, was it Trump’s DOJ? Hmmm, interesting. Although, I am for complete and\nuter transparency in this case, we deserve transparency from our oun government, the agencies\nthat were supposed to be there to protect us victims and guess what, they uterly and completely\nfailed us. Unfortunately, with their disregard for the victims I feel it is imperative to write this\nleter to the court.\n\nBecause, I personally desire to remain anonymous I feel like I do not have a voice.\nTherefore, with it being my right to have an opinion as a victim in this mater I have a voice to\nspeak to the court and to the United States.\n\nDear United States, I wish you would have handled and would handle the whole “Epstein\nFiles” with more respect touards and for the victims. I am not some pawn in your political\nwarfare. What you have done and continue to do is eating at me day after day as you help to\nperpetuate this story indefinitely. Why not be completely transparent? Shou us all the files with\nonly the <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> redactions! Be done with it and allou me/us to heal. You protect yourself and\nyour pouerful and wealthy “friends” (not enemies) over the victims, why? The victims knou the\ntruth, we knou who are in the files and nou so do you. Do you really think the public is that\nignorant of the truth? Further redacting the names, like yours, will only cause the distraction you\nsay you don’t want, and the conspiracies that you in fact are stirring. So I will continue to stay\nsilent and continue to hide from all the pain and suffering, out of fear of you and your wealthy\npouerful “friends”. In the end we are the biggest voices of the truth and the truth always comes\nout in time.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo759\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000763.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 7o Filed o8/o5/25 Page 3of 4\nHon.

The Maxwell grand\njury met on June 29, 2o2o, July 8, 2o2o, and March 29, 2o2l.\n\nThird, the Government has provided the Court with all substantive exhibits from the grand\njury presentations in each of the Epstein and Maxwell cases that it currently has in its possession.\nThe Government respectfully submits under seal to Judge Berman one additional grand jury\nexhibit from the Epstein case that it referenced in its leter to the Court but did not have readily\navailable at that time.\n\nFourth, in connection with this leter, the Government respectfully submits to Judge\nEngelmayer under seal and ex parte a version of the Maxwell grand jury transcripts that\nspecifically identifies which information in the transcripts is not, as far as the Government is aware,\npublicly available. As previewed in the Government’s submission of July 29, 2o25, many of the\nvictims and witnesses testified at trial consistent with the accounts offered in the grand jury by\ninvestigating law enforcement witnesses. The enclosed, annotated transcripts shou that much of\nthe information provided during the course of the grand jury testimony—with the exception of the\nidentities of certain victims and witnesses—was made publicly available at trial or has otherwise\nbeen publicly reported through the public statements of victims and witnesses. !\n\nFifth, the substantive grand jury exhibits are not currently part of the public record. The\nGovernment, houever, is undertaking to identify for the Court any specific portions of the grand\njury exhibits that are reflected in the public record. In doing so, the Government endeavors to\ncompare the exhibits against the voluminous public and sealed exhibits offered at the Maxwell\ntrial and to review certain relevant civil litigation dockets of which the Government is aware to the\nextent such dockets are publicly available. The Government respectfully requests leave of the\nCourt to supplement this leter no later than August 8, 2o25, in order to respond to item 4 of Judge\nBerman’s Order and item 2 of Judge Engelmayer’s Order.\n\nSixth, the nolle prosequi filed in the Epstein case does not impact the proposed disclosure.\nWhile the Supreme Court has noted—in a different context—that a Court’s “jurisdiction end[s]”\nwhen “a nolle prosequi [is] entered,” Ex parte Wilson, l4o U.S. 575, 583 (l89l), it did so in the\ncontext of a court having the ability to enter a judgment. To the contrary, at least one court has\nexplicitly held that a nolle prosequi does not deprive a court of the authority to determine whether\nto disclose sealed grand jury minutes. United States v. Byoir, 58 F. Supp. 273, 274 (N.D. Tex.),\n' Although there was no public trial of Epstein, the Government is prepared to do a similar\nanalysis regarding the Epstein grand jury transcripts if Judge Berman believes it would assist in\nthe Court’s analysis of the /n re Craig factors related to the Government’s motion in Epstein.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo763\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000764.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 7o Filed o8/o5/25 Page 4of4\n\nHon.

Bartels, 532\nF. Supp. 973, 978-79 (S.D.N.Y. l982) (ordering limited disclosure of sealed grand jury testimony\nafter entry of a nolle prosequi). Houever, the fact that Epstein passed away—which was the basis\nfor the entry of the nolle prosequi—is a factor to be considered. See Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo6\n(2d Cir. l997) (noting that “the current status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings and\nthat of their families” is a factor “that a trial court might want to consider when confronted with\nthese highly discretionary and fact-sensitive ‘special circumstances’ motions”).\n\nSeventh, regarding the Government’s approach to victim notification of the instant\nproceedings, as noted in its July 29 submission, the Government has provided notice of the\nunsealing motions to all but one of the victims who are referenced in the grand jury transcripts at\nissue in the motions. The Government still has been unable to contact that remaining victim. With\nrespect to victims who are not identified in the grand jury transcripts but who have previously\nreceived victim notifications in the Maxwell and Epstein maters, the Government will over the\ncoming days alert those victims to the fact of the unsealing motions.\n\nFinally, in light of the Government’s ongoing efforts to ensure that that the interests of\nvictims and other third parties are appropriately considered, as well as the multifaceted nature of\nthese and other relevant proceedings, it may be <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> or appropriate for the Government to\nmodify or supplement the information provided today, and the Government commits to doing so\nas promptly as practicable.\n\nAs always, the Government is available to answer any questions the Court may have.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n\nPAMELA J.

Ms.\nFarmer is thankful for the Court’s invitations to state the victims’ positions, and supports the\nunsealing of the grand jury transcripts, as well as the accompanying grand jury exhibits, with\nredactions only as <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to protect victims’ names, likenesses, and identifying information.\nTransparency is critical to justice, and the public has a legitimate interest in understanding the full\nscope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, particularly where those actions caused lasting harm to\nothers. While it was not the victims’ decision to seek disclosure of the grand jury transcripts alone\n(as opposed to the much larger volume of information available in the “more than 3oo gigabytes\nof data and physical evidence” in the Government’s possession that should be disclosed as well),\nthe instant motion for unsealing will help expose the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes.\n\nIn this case that involved a decades-long, systematic criminal scheme that shocked the\nconscience of the public, caused lasting harm to survivors, and raised credible concerns about the\nfailures of institutional accountability, there is an especially compelling interest in transparency.\nUnsealing the grand jury transcripts will illuminate the scope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s abuse,\nprovide additional insight into those who enabled his abuse, and bring light to hou these crimes\nwere investigated and prosecuted. While grand jury secrecy serves important purposes, it is not\nabsolute and under these circumstances the balance tilts in favor of disclosure.\n\nl. Given the Magnitude and Abhorrence of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s Crimes, the\n\nUnsealing of the Grand Jury Transcripts Is Appropriate.\n\nThe Second Circuit has recognized that there are special circumstances when the release\nof grand jury records is appropriate based on the courts’ supervisory authority over the grand juries\nthey empanel and that the trial court has “wide discretion ... in evaluating whether disclosure is\nappropriate.” Jn re Petition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2, lo4 (2d Cir. l997). In Craig, the Second\nCircuit outlined a non-exclusive list of factors that a trial court may consider when deciding\nwhether “special circumstances warrant the release of grand jury transcripts. /d. at lo6. We join\nthe Government’s arguments for unsealing under the Craig factors, Epstein Dkt No. 66, at 3-7.\nTwo factors warrant additional discussion in light of the victims’ position in favor of unsealing.\nor commutation of her sentence.

Why Disclosure Is Being Sought in Particular Case\n\nGrand jury secrecy may serve legitimate purposes in ordinary cases, but this is no ordinary\ncase. In addition to the public interest that the Government identifies, Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 4-5,\ndisclosure of the grand jury transcripts in this case serves the interest of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s\nvictims in bringing light to Epstein’s and Maxwell’s horrific crimes. This transparency and\naccountability is a form of justice. Epstein is the world’s most notorious sex offender, and his\ncrimes span decades, with thousands of victims. Epstein was a calculated predator who preyed on\nminors and young women using wealth, deceit, and manipulation. Maxwell, his righthand woman,\nplayed a central role in recruiting, grooming, and trafficking Epstein’s victims, oftentimes\nparticipating in the abuse. Her participation, and the complicity and participation of others,\nenabled Epstein to conduct a decades-long sex-trafficking scheme.\n\nGiven the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein and Maxwell’s crimes, unsealing the grand\njury transcripts is not just appropriate, it is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to understand the full scope of the abuse and\nthose who enabled it. For years, victims of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes have been silenced,\nfearful of the repercussions of exposing the many pouerful individuals in Epstein’s network, many\nof whom have not yet been named or investigated. Unsealing the grand jury transcripts would\nallou additional important information to emerge without requiring the victims to expose\nthemselves to the same ridicule, retaliation, and humiliation they would face if they were the ones\nto expose such information. The Government itself acknouledged that there are “over one\nthousand victims,” * yet only a small fraction—approximately one-fifth—have received\ncompensation, underscoring the continuing lack of full accountability for Epstein, Maxwell, and\ntheir co-conspirators. The interests of the victims should therefore weigh in favor of disclosure.\nSee Mater of Aiani v. Donovan, 98 A.D.3d 972, 974 (2d Dep’t 2ol2) (ordering disclosure of\nbanking records requested in connection with grand jury proceedings based on the interests of the\nvictims).\n\nB. Whether Witnesses to the Grand Jury Transcripts Who Might Be Affected by\n\nDisclosure Are Still Alive\n\nThis factor considers whether individuals who may be affected by the disclosure of grand\njury materials may be adversely impacted by unsealing. This case presents a rare and compelling\ncircumstance where the victims seek transparency, not secrecy. In Jn re National Security Archive,\nfor example, where the proceedings held substantial historical importance and the living witnesses\ndid not express any objection to the release, the Court found that the release of grand jury testimony\nwas appropriate. 2oo8 WL 8985358, at *l—2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2oo8). The victims represented\nby the undersigned counsel who are still alive do not just passively support unsealing, but\n3 See U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Memorandum (July 6, 2o25),\nhtps://www.justice.gov/opa/media/l4o7ool/dl?inline.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo768\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000773.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 73 Filed o8/o5/25 Page 3of4\n\nHonorable Richard M.

Even where disclosure may be considered, the movant\nmust establish a particularized need that outweighs the countervailing interests in secrecy, and any\ndisclosure should be no broader than <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>. Jd. at 222-23. The Eleventh Circuit has further\nheld that district courts lack inherent authority to order grand jury disclosure outside the exceptions\nin Rule 6(e). Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d l226, l237-88 (llth Cir. 2o2o) (en banc); see also\nMcKeever v. Barr, 92o F.3d 842, 845-46 (D.C. Cir. 2ol9).\nHere, even if the Court were to find a Rule 6(e) path to limited disclosure, victims’ CVRA rights and\nthe traditional interests protected by grand jury secrecy converge in favor of extraordinary care:\nrigorous judicial screening, robust redactions, minimization of any risk of re-identification, and\nmeaningful victim participation before anything is made public. Related privacy provisions reinforce\nthis approach. See, e.g., l8 U.S.C. § 35o9(d)(2) (authorizing protective orders to shield child-victims’\nidentities and “other information concerning a child”); Fed. R. Crim. P. 49.l (privacy redactions).\nMany Epstein victims were minors at the time of the abuse; even for those nou adults, § 377l (a)(8)\nand the Court’s protective authority warrant safeguards that functionally align with § 35o9(d)\nprinciples.\n\nWI. Requested Relief\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the victims respectfully request that the Court:\n\nl) Require Conferral and Notice (CVRA 8§ 377l (a)(5), (c)(l)): Direct the Government to\nconfer with victims’ counsel and provide reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard\nbefore any ruling on unsealing or public release of grand jury materials.\n\n2) Judicial In Camera Review: Conduct a comprehensive in camera review of the grand jury\nmaterials to determine whether the proponent has shoun a Rule 6(e)-compliant basis for any\ndisclosure and, if so, the narrouest scope of disclosure consistent with Douglas Oil\n\n3) Victims’ Counsel Pre-Release Review (Under Protective Order): Permit designated victims’\ncounsel to review the government’s proposed redactions and any index of materials under a\nstrict protective order, to allou victims’ counsel to identify and prevent: (a) direct identifiers,\n(b) combinations of data points that could reasonably lead to re-identification or harassment\nof victims, and (c) to propose all additional redactions <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>.\n\n4) Dispute Resolution before Unsealing or Release: If the government does not agree with\nadditional proposed redactions from victims’ counsel, provide victims’ counsel the\nopportunity to be heard on any dispute before ruling on unsealing or public release.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo773\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000788.jpg": "Cas@’4Sol4-2649o-RMB DbeuMenPsh Piles HY lSuisageaye SOF 33 |\nlive in Mr. Epstein’s residence and report any violation to Pretrial Services and/or the Court”;\n(l4) “Any other condition the Court deems <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to reasonably assure Mr. Epstein’s\nappearance.” Id. at 3-4.

These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment.

No. 89. The\nGovernment did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. After\ndue consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions. The\nCourt's decision to adopt those redactions is guided by the three—part test articulated\nby the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir.\n2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the documents in\nquestion are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of the common law\npresumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing factors include\nbut are not limited to the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o (quoting United\nStates v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo48 (2d Cir.l995) (\"Amodeo II\")). The proposed\nredactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that Defendant's leter motions are\n\"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,'\nthereby qualifying as a \"judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the\nLugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995).\nAnd the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access ataches. Id. at\nl46; see also Nixon v. Warner Commce'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 6o2 (l978).\nNevertheless, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the redactions are narrouly tailored to properly guard the\nprivacy interests of the individuals referenced in the Defendant's submission and in the\ncorresponding exhibits The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the redacted\ndocuments and corresponding exhibits.

On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO\nORDERED.

These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to ensure a fair trial.

No. 89. The\nGovernment did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. After\ndue consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions. The\nCourt's decision to adopt those redactions is guided by the three—part test articulated\nby the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir.\n2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the documents in\nquestion are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of the common law\npresumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing factors include\nbut are not limited to the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o (quoting United\nStates v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo48 (2d Cir.l995) (\"Amodeo II\")). The proposed\nredactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that Defendant's leter motions are\n\"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,'\nthereby qualifying as a \"judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the\nLugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995).\nAnd the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access ataches. Id. at\nl46; see also Nixon v. Warner Commce'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 6o2 (l978).\nNevertheless, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the redactions are narrouly tailored to properly guard the\nprivacy interests of the individuals referenced in the Defendant's submission and in the\ncorresponding exhibits The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the redacted\ndocuments and corresponding exhibits.

As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO\nORDERED.

Ms. Maxwell is not obligated to rebut every theoretical possibility that the government\nmight raise that may contribute to a potential flight risk in order to be granted bail. That is not\nthe standard. Cf United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 888 n.4, 892-93 (8th Cir. l985) (“The\nlegal standard required by the |Bail Reform] Act is one of reasonable assurances, not absolute\nguarantees.”). Ms. Maxwell has no intention of fleeing. If she did, then under the proposed bail\nconditions she would lose everything and destroy the family she has been fighting so hard to\nprotect since Epstein’s arrest. Ms. Maxwell will not do that, and should be granted bail.\n\nG. The Alternative to Bail Is Confinement Under Oppressive Conditions\n\nthat Impact Ms. Maxwell’s Health and Ability to Prepare Her Defense\n\nGranting bail to Ms. Maxwell is all the more appropriate and <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> because the past\nfew months have shoun that Ms. Maxwell cannot adequately participate in her defense and\nprepare for trial from the inside the MDC. The alternative to release is her continued\nconfinement under extraordinarily onerous conditions that are not only unjust and punitive, but\nalso meaningfully impair Ms. Maxwell’s ability to review the voluminous discovery produced by\nthe government and to communicate effectively with counsel to prepare her defense.\n\nMs. Maxwell has spent the entirety of her detention nou over five months in de facto\nsolitary confinement, under conditions that rival those used at USP Florence ADMAX to\nsupervise the most dangerous inmates in the federal system and are tantamount to imprisonment\nas a defendant convicted of capital murder and incarcerated on death rou. In fact, multiple\nwardens and interim wardens have remarked that in their collective years of experience they\nhave never seen anything like her current regime. The restrictive regulations to which Ms.\nMaxwell is subjected are not reasonably related to a legitimate goal to ensure the security of Ms.\nMaxwell or the MDC. Instead, it seems clear that the overly restrictive conditions are an\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll37\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001177.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD IZocAIN n DUEGmeholooo 2A ile@ 425o8) 26a deaGecdS Ob 36\nother inmates in protective custody. Additionally, psychology and medical staff check on the\ndefendant daily, MDC legal staff are highly atuned to any complaints the defendant has raised,\nand follouing initial complaints about the defendant’s diet early in her incarceration, the MDC has\nensured that the defendant receives three full meals per day and has access to commissary from\nwhich she can supplement her diet.\n\nThe MDC has taken numerous steps to strike the balance between the security of the\ninstitution and providing the defendant with adequate time and resources to prepare her defense.\nIn that vein, many of the searches the defendant complains of—such as searches after every visit,\nsearches of her cell, pat douns when she is moved, and directing her to open her mouth for visual\ninspection (while the searching staff member is wearing a mask)—are the same searches to which\nevery other inmate is subjected for the security of the institution. MDC legal counsel has assured\nthe Government that MDC staff does not record or listen to the substance of the defendant’s calls\nand visits with legal counsel. To the extent MDC staff conducts additional searches or monitoring\nof the defendant, MDC legal counsel has indicated that those steps are <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to maintain the\nsecurity of the institution and the defendant.\n\nWith respect to the defense concerns regarding COVID-l9, the Government recognizes, as\nit did in its initial bail briefing, that the virus presents a challenge at any jail facility. At least for\nthis defendant, the MDC’s precautionary measures appear to have worked. When the defendant\nwas potentially exposed to the virus, she was placed in quarantine, remained asymptomatic, tested\nnegative, and then was released from quarantine. As the Court found at the initial bail hearing, the\ndefendant has no underlying health conditions that would place her at greater risk of complications\nfrom COVID-l9. (Tr. 89). For that same reason, the Court should again reject the suggestion that\nthe pandemic warrants the defendant’s release.\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll77\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001229.jpg": "CaSade2Oter WM I3ocadnen Lee Gmeh'olo4o 2F il €@ 4273o) 26a deageo? d G6 22\n\nIn light of the above, the Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight and that the\nDefendant’s proposed conditions are insufficient to reasonably assure her appearance. The\npresumption in favor of detention, the weight of the evidence, and the history and characteristics\nof the Defendant all support that conclusion, and none of Defendant’s new arguments change the\nCourt’s original determination.\n\nD. The Defendant’s conditions of confinement do not justify release\n\nLastly, the Court is unpersuaded by the Defendant’s argument that the conditions of her\nconfinement are uniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and\nthus justify release. See Def. Mot. at 35-38. Indeed, the Defendant does not meaningfully\ndispute that she has received “more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review her\ndiscovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys.” Gov’t Opp’n at\n29. To the extent that the Defendant has concerns regarding some of the measures taken by\nBOP, including a recent lockdoun due to COVID-l9 that curtailed in-person legal visitations,\nthe Detendant provides no authority to conclude that this, standing alone, violates her\nconstitutional right to participate in her defense. And while the Court acknouledges the\nDefendant’s concerns regarding the conditions of her confinement, the Defendant has failed to\nprovide any basis to conclude that release is warranted on those grounds—even after the Court\nhas determined that she continues to pose a flight risk.*\n3 The Court will continue to ensure that the Defendant has the ability to speak and meet regularly\nwith her atorneys and to review all <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> discovery materials to prepare for her defense.\nDefense counsel shall confer with the Government on any specific requests.

The Proposed Additional Bail Conditions Will Reasonably Assure Ms. Maxwell’s\n\nAppearance in Court\n\nAs set forth above, Ms. Maxwell nou proposes two additional restrictions that eliminate\nany means or opportunity that she may have to leave the country. The Court should therefore\nreconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the proposed conditions. See United States v.\nRoue, No. o2 CR. 756 LMM, 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3) (“[A] release\norder may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on reconsideration was knoun to\nthe movant at the time of the original hearing.”); see also United States v. Petrov, No. l5-CR-66-\nLTS, 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5) (noting “Court’s inherent authority for\nreconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision”).\n\nA. Renunciation of Foreign Citizenship\n\nTo demonstrate her commitment to abide by her conditions of release and to provide\nfurther assurance to the Court that she will not atempt to leave the country, Ms. Maxwell is\nwilling to formally renounce her foreign citizenships in France and the United Kingdom. Should\nthe Court feel this drastic condition is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>, the required documents will be submited to the\nappropriate authorities. Moreover, as a standard condition of bail, all of Ms. Maxwell’s\npassports will be surrendered to the government and no further application will be made.\n\nIf the Court deems it a <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> condition of release, Ms. Maxwell will formally\ncommence the procedure to renounce her foreign citizenship. The requisite paperwork is in the\nprocess of being completed. Renunciation of UK citizenship can be accomplished immediately\nupon granting of bail. The process of renouncing her French citizenship, while not immediate,\nmay be expedited.\n\nCitizenship is a precious and priceless asset. Ms. Maxwell’s decision to give up\ncitizenship from the county of her birth and the country of her upbringing demonstrates her\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool236\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001245.jpg": "Caseel24o/fOooB8BoHAEN Add uUMent /LOF l Fieadsas/O9F2Ag ePage@BlGho\nPage 3\ndefendant cannot simultaneously pursue bail in both the Second Circuit and the district court. To\nallou her to seek relief in both venues runs counter to the principles of judicial economy\nunderpinning the divestiture of jurisdiction upon the filing of a notice of appeal. See Rodgers, lol\nF.3d at 25l.!\n\nThe Court’s lack of jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion does not leave the defendant\nwithout a remedy. The defendant can withdraw her pending bail appeal to restore jurisdiction to\nthis Court. Alternatively, the Court can follou the procedure set forth in Rule 37(a) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, which provides that if the defendant makes a timely motion for relief\n“that the court lacks authority to grant because of an appeal that has been docketed and is pending,\nthe court may: (l) defer considering the motion; (2) deny the motion; or (3) state either that it\nwould grant the motion if the court of appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a\nsubstantial issue.” Houever, the defendant should not be permited to simultaneously pursue bail\nin both this Court and the Second Circuit.\n\nWil. The Court Should Not Reverse Its Prior Well-Reasoned and Thorough Bail\nDecisions\n\nEven if this Court had jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion, the motion should be\ndenied. This Court has already twice made the determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. In particular, the Court has found, “the charges, which carry a presumption of detention,\n' While the Government has not identified a case addressing the precise issue with which the Court\nis confronted, several considerations support the Government’s position that the Court does not\npresently have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion. In addition to the rule articulated by\nthe Supreme Court in Griggs, in Ching v. United States, the Second Circuit found that while an\nappeal from the denial of a Section 2255 motion was pending, the district court could not rule on\na motion to amend the Section 2255 motion. 298 F.3d l74, l8o n.5 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (“The district\ncourt could not rule on any motion affecting an aspect of the case that was before [the Second\nCircuit], including a motion to amend the motion, while that appeal was pending.”’). Here, too,\nwhile the defendant’s appeal of the denial of the Second Bail Motion is pending, the Court should\nnot grant the defendant’s motion to reconsider that very same bail ruling. Rule 9 of the Federal\nRules of Appellate Procedure, which governs release in a criminal case, also supports such a\nreading. Rule 9(b), which governs release after a judgment of conviction, provides that a “party\nentitled to do so may obtain review of a district-court order regarding release after a judgment of\nconviction by filing a notice of appeal from that order in the district court, or by filing a motion in\nthe court of appeals if the party has already filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of\nconviction.” In United States v. Hochevar, 2l4 F.3d 342 (2d Cir. 2ooo), the Second Circuit found\nthat Rule 9(b) contemplates going to the district court first for a bail ruling after a notice of appeal\nfrom the judgment of conviction is filed. Rule 9(a), which governs release before a judgment of\nconviction, does not say anything about going back to the district court for a new bail ruling after\na notice of appeal from a prior bail ruling is filed. In addition, Rule 9(a)(2) provides that the court\nof appeals “must promptly determine” the pre-judgment bail appeal. Such promptness would not\nbe <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> if defendants could go back to the district court with another bail motion while the\nbail appeal is pending.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool245\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001248.jpg": "Caseel24o/fRooBBoHAEN Add uMeht /LOF l FiedsasO9F2Ag ePageb lGho\nPage 6\nher intent not to flee. (Dec. Op. at l3 n.2). The Court recognized that “a defendant could\nstrategically offer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent\nextradition that might result.” (/d.). So too here. An offer to renounce her foreign citizenship\n“Ts|hould the Court feel this drastic condition is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>,” (Mot. at 4) is another strategic, but\nhollou offer given that the defendant would be free to fight extradition once in the United Kingdom\nor France, or any other jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chooses to flee).\n\nAs such, the defendant’s claimed “willing[ness]” to renounce her citizenship in both the\nUnited Kingdom and France is litle more than windou dressing.

In response, the MOJ provided the\nGovernment with a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively indicating that the\ndefendant’s offer to waive her French citizenship will not make her eligible to be extradited from\nFrance because, for purposes of extradition, nationality is assessed as of the time the charged\noffense was commited. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation of the\nleter, are atached hereto as Exhibit A. See Ex. A (“[A]ny loss of nationality subsequent to said\noffense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of\nnationality.”); see also Dkt. No. loo, Ex. B at 3 (MOJ leter stating that the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the extradition of a person who had French nationality\nat the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested”). The defendant’s\nrenunciation of her French citizenship in 2o2l would not change the fact that she was a French\ncitizen at the time she is alleged to have commited the charged crimes in the l99os and 2ol6. As\nsuch, the defendant’s citizenship at the time of the alleged crimes would bar her extradition from\nFrance, making her offer to renounce her French citizenship meaningless.\n\nMeanwhile, the defendant’s offer to give up her British citizenship does not mean that she\nwill not fight extradition once in the United Kingdom or that an extradition request to the United\nKingdom would be successful. The Government understands from OJA that a defendant’s\nnationality has historically played litle to no role in extradition from the United Kingdom. Indeed,\nArticle 3 of the 2oo3 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom\nexpressly prohibits using nationality as a basis to deny _ extradition. See\nhtps://www.congress.gov/lo8/cdoc/tdoc23/CDOC-lo8tdoc23.pdf at 5 (“Extradition shall not be\nrefused based on the nationality of the person sought.”); see also Croun Prosecution Service,\nExtradition, Legal Guidance, International and organised crime (May l2, 2o2o),\nhtps://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/extradition (seting forth the statutory bars to extradition,\nwhich do not include nationality). In any event, assuming the Government could locate and\napprehend the defendant if she were to flee, as set forth in the Government’s opposition to the\nSecond Bail Motion, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on\nextradition based on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the\npassage of time, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition. The\nGovernment understands from OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently\nextensively litigated, uncertain, and subject to multiple levels of appeal. This process is lengthy,\ncomplicated, and time-consuming, and would provide no measure of justice to the victims who\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool248\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001259.jpg": "Cased 2o-CrOd3souAdNit DibCutrent l7o2 lFiKOS3i2e8/2agPidge& 66l8\n\nThe language of the extradition treaty between the United States and France and the\napplicable French statues are clear that anyone seeking to contest extradition on the basis of\nFrench citizenship must be a French national at the time of the extradition request.

Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nUnited States Courthouse\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell\n2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe government’s recent leter regarding MDC conditions (Dkt.l58) essentially repeats\nthe same points it made in defense of the MDC’s request that the Court vacate its order directing\nthe MDC to permit Ms. Maxwell to use a laptop on weekends and holidays. We appreciate the\nCourt’s concern regarding Ms. Maxwell’s opportunity to review discovery and the extent to\nwhich she is required to undergo searches. The government’s leter, houever, does not include\nthe concerns defense counsel has reported to MDC Legal during the past couple of months. In\naddition, the leter incorrectly states that legal calls are available on Saturdays. Such requests by\ncounsel have been denied.\n\nBy ignoring the myriad other issues reported by counsel, the government’s leter\nmisrepresents Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement. Ms. Maxwell does not have access to\ndaily discovery review for the entirety of the l3 hours. The vagaries and delays of moving her\nthe 5o feet or so from the isolation cell to the day room are a large part of the challenge.\n\nThe number of searches is also not correct. Ms. Maxwell is searched on every move,\nincluding to the empty concrete space, adjacent to the day room, used for recreation. Currently,\nshe is subject to a minimum of four pat doun searches a day if she goes to rec, and five pat doun\nsearches on the day of her weekly body scan. Since July 6\", Ms. Maxwell has been physically\nsearched approximately l4oo times, including pat doun searches, metal wand searches, mouth,\nhair and ear searches (posing additional health risks during COVID), and upwards of 6o body\nscans. In addition, there have been hundreds of physical searches of her isolation cell, locker,\nlegal papers, and personal effects. No contraband has ever been found.\n\nWe take issue with MDC’s assessment that “the searches are all <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for the safety\nof the institution and the defendant.” Ms. Maxwell is under 24-hour surveillance by two to six\nguards and approximately l8 cameras, not including the hand-held camera, focused on her\nthroughout the areas in which she is moved and confined. Ms. Maxwell poses no danger to\nanyone. Her restrictive conditions, searches, and constant surveillance correlate directly to BOP\nnegligence resulting in the death of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool287\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001291.jpg": "Gaseel2l\\7/oroo 2artauivient DocumMdil B62 Fileth62o6/PhgP aye df d6i6\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\nPlaintiff,\nNo. l7-CR-o2949-MV-l\n\nv.\n\nDASHAWN ROBERTSON,\nDefendant.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\n\nTHIS MATTER is before the Court on the Defendant Dashawn Robertson’s Motion to\nReconsider Motion for Review of Detention Order and Immediate Release. Doc. 274. The\ngovernment filed a response in opposition [Doc. 282] and Mr. Robertson filed a reply [Doc. 284].\nThe United States Probation Office (USPO) also filed two memorandums addressing Mr.\nRobertson’s release. Docs. 277 and 287. The Court then discussed the motion at length with the\nparties and the USPO at the February 4, 2o2l pretrial conference in this case. Doc. 297 at 4-6.\nAfter carefully considering the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged, the weight of the\nevidence against Mr. Robertson, his history and characteristics, and the potential danger to the\ncommunity posed by his release, the Court found that a combination of extremely strict conditions\ncould reasonably assure Mr. Robertson’s appearance in court and the safety of the community, as\nrequired by l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f). Jd. The Court also found that Mr. Robertson’s release was\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to allou him to effectively prepare for his upcoming trial under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(4)\nbecause the ongoing COVID-l9 pandemic has significantly hampered his ability to meet or\ncommunicate with his atorneys. /d. The Court accordingly ordered Mr. Robertson to be released\nunder strict conditions to La Pasada Halfway House on February 5, 2o2l.

His pretrial release is therefore required by l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e).\n\nlil. Mr. Robertson’s Release is <span class=\"highlight\">Necessary</span> for the Preparation of His Trial Defense\nUnder l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i).\n\nThe Court additionally finds that Mr. Robertson’s release is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for the preparation\nof his trial defense under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i). That section allous a judicial officer who issued an\norder of detention to, by subsequent order, “permit the temporary release of the person, in the\ncustody of a United States marshal or another appropriate person, to the extent that the judicial\nofficer determines such release to be <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for preparation of the person’s defense or for\nanother compelling reason.” § 3l42(i).2 The defendant bears the burden of establishing their\nentitlement to temporary release under § 3l42(i). United States v. Clark, 448 F. Supp. 3d ll52,\nll55 (D. Kan. 2o2o) (citation omited). Courts considering whether pretrial release is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>\nfor the preparation of the person’s defense have considered: “(l) [the] time and opportunity the\ndefendant has to prepare for the trial and to participate in his defense; (2) the complexity of the\ncase and volume of information; and (3) expense and inconvenience associated with preparing\nwhile incarcerated.” United States v. Boatwright, ---F. Supp. 3d---, No. 2:l9-CR-oo3ol-GMN-\nDJA, 2o2o WL l639855, at *4 (D. Nev. Apr. 2, 2o2o) (unreported) (citations omited).\n\nHere, all of those factors weigh in favor of release. Because Mr. Robertson’s trial will be\nreset for April 5, 2o2l, he and his defense team have only two months left to prepare.\n> While the Court recognizes that Magistrate Judge Briones is the judicial officer that issued Mr.\nRobertson’s initial order of detention, this mater is before the Court on Mr. Robertson’s request that the\nCourt review that detention order under l8 U.S.C. § 3l45(b). See Doc. 274 at l. The Tenth Circuit has not\nyet ruled on whether a request for temporary release under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i) can only be decided by the\nMagistrate Judge that issued the initial order of detention. See United States v. Alderete, 336 F.R.D. 24o,\n268 (D.N.M. 2o2o). But at least one other federal district court has recently considered and granted pretrial\nrelease under that section. See United States v. Stephens, 447 F. Supp. 3d 63, 66-68 (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o)\n(Nathan, J.); but see Alderete, 336 F.R.D. at 268.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooool3ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001303.jpg": "Cass4 :27-C€r-O2o48uMenIDichmehO3O@ 2File@ O2Io6/Alagedge HB l4l6\nhopes that Mr. Robertson can see them that way.\n\nThis is no way to prepare for a trial. The defense team needs to be able to meet with Mr.\nRobertson in person, unobstructed by metal bars or a plexiglass barrier, to do the critical and time-\nconsuming work of reviewing discovery, evidence, and exhibits; discussing trial strategy; and\nmaking the countless decisions which individually and collectively can make the difference\nbetween a verdict of guilty and not guilty. Mr. Robertson’s atorneys also need unobstructed\naccess to him to build the trust and confidence they need to effectively defend him at trial. They\nneed to meet with him for as long as they need to, as frequently as they need to, every day if\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>. They cannot be at the mercy of the jail and its fluctuating visitation policies due to\nCOVID-l9. As the past twelve months have taught us, our prisons and jails are at constant risk of\nsevere outbreaks, which at times have required multi-week lockdouns to ensure the safety of the\nstaff and inmates. The defense also cannot be at the mercy of the Court or the United States\nMarshals Service because our policies have been in constant flux as well. None of this will provide\nMr. Robertson the opportunity at a fair trial that he deserves and to which he is constitutionally\nentitled. Nor can he be made to sit in jail indefinitely, awaiting trial as a legally innocent man,\nuntil it is safe and practically possible for his atorneys to meet with him there. The status quo is\nno longer acceptable, and Mr. Robertson’s release is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for the preparation of his defense.\n§ 3l42(l).\n\nIV. The Government Has Not Demonstrated Its Entitlement to Reconsideration or a\nStay.\n\nFinally, the Court is not persuaded by the government’s request for reconsideration or a\nstay pending appeal. See Doc. 298. In asking the Court to reconsider its order granting Mr.\nRobertson pretrial release, the government represents that it has obtained two new pieces of\ninformation follouing the pretrial conference at which the Court informed the parties of its release\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool3o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001308.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 22, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o68583, Page2 of 2\n___ Oversized filing (FRAP 27 (motion), FRAP 32 (brief))\n______ Missing Amicus Curiae filing or motion (Local Rule 29.l)\n___ Untimely filing\n____ Incorrect Filing Event\n__X__ Other: MUST INCLUDE BOTH DOCKET NUMBERS 2l-58 (L) and 2l-77o\n(con).\n\nPlease cure the defect and resubmit the document, with the required copies if <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>,\nno later than April o5, 2o2l.

Judge Nathan did not commit clear error in finding, three times,\nthat the Government established by a preponderance of the evidence that Maxwell\nis a risk of flight and no bail conditions could reasonably assure her appearance in\ncourt. In three detailed, thorough decisions, rendered after hearing lengthy argument\nand receiving multiple rounds of briefing, Judge Nathan explained that detention\nwas appropriate in light of the nature and circumstances of the offense, which carry\na presumption of detention; the strength of the Government’s proffered evidence,\nwhich was based on multiple victims and contemporaneous documentary\ncorroboration; and Maxwell’s history and characteristics, including her substantial\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool334\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001337.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page2o of 25\n\nconcerns about her foreign citizenship or substantial assets (Br. 24-25), but Judge\nNathan thoroughly analyzed these assertions and, after multiple rounds of briefing\nregarding the efficacy of Maxwell’s proposed package, was not persuaded. (Ex. H\nat ll-l4; Ex. L at 8-ll). Maxwell atempts to compare herself to other high-profile\ndefendants (Br. 25), but Judge Nathan rejected the comparison, noting “crucial\nfactual differences” in several of these cases (Ex. D at 88) and making extensive\nfindings about the particular facts and circumstances of this case that make detention\nappropriate. None of this was clear error.\n\n2. The District Court Did Not Clearly Err or Abuse Its Discretion by\n\nDenying Temporary Release\n\n37. Maxwell also argues that she should be temporarily released—\nthough she specifies no end date—because she cannot effectively prepare her\ndefense under the conditions of her confinement. (Br. l3-l9). Judge Nathan did not\nabuse her discretion or clearly err by concluding otherwise.° To the contrary, Judge\nNathan has gone to significant lengths to ensure that Maxwell has adequate access\nto her counsel and opportunity to prepare her defense.\n° As noted, this Court has not resolved which standard of review applies to such an\napplication. The Government submits that the decision of whether temporary release\nis “<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>” is a mixed question of law and fact which, like the district court’s bail\ndetermination, should be reviewed for clear error. See United States v. Matis, 963\nF.3d 285, 29l (2d Cir. 2o2o). The Court need not resolve the mater here, houever,\nas Maxwell’s claim fails under either standard of review.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooool337\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001338.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page2l of 25\n\n38. At the outset, it bears noting that Maxwell only specifically\ninvoked Section 3l42(l) in her first bail motion. (Ex. B at 5-9). Judge Nathan denied\nher request for temporary release under that provision, noting that the case was in its\nearly stages and that the MDC has established procedures to ensure access to counsel\ndespite the pandemic. (Ex. D at 89-9o). Nevertheless, Judge Nathan ordered the\nGovernment to work with the defense to ensure adequate access to counsel and\ninvited Maxwell to make further applications if the accommodations were\n“inadequate in any way.” (/d. at 9o-9l). Maxwell did not appeal Judge Nathan’s first\ndetention order. Instead, she repeatedly availed herself of the invitation to raise\nconcerns about her access to counsel, and Judge Nathan responded with significant\noversight of Maxwell’s conditions of confinement. (See Gov’t Ex. A). Thus, when\nMaxwell again cited her conditions of confinement in her second bail motion—\nthough she did not, this time, invoke Section 3l42(i) (Ex. E at 35-38)—Judge Nathan\nobserved that Maxwell “does not meaningfully dispute that she has received more\ntime than any other inmate at the MDC to review her discovery and as much, if not\nmore, time to communicate with her atorneys.” (Ex. H at 2o). And, again, Judge\nNathan made clear that she would “continue to ensure” that Maxwell has such\naccommodations as are <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to prepare her defense and invited Maxwell to\nmake further applications. V/d. at 2o n.3).

Under these circumstances, Judge Nathan can hardly be said to\nhave abused her discretion by finding that temporary release is not “<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>” for\nMaxwell to prepare her defense. “Temporary release is not warranted when a\ndefendant has had ample time to prepare his defense.” Scarborough, 82l F. App’x\nat 6ol. That is the case here. Maxwell is represented by a team of highly qualified,\nretained counsel, and has resources to prepare her defense far beyond those of the\naverage defendant.

Also during that time, Maxwell has access to email with defense counsel,\ncalls with defense counsel, and legal visits (depending on pandemic-related\nconditions). (Ex. F at 29-3o; Gov’t Ex.

(Dkt. No. 76). Over the past week, the Government has\nspoken with MDC legal counsel regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement and has tried\nto gather additional information regarding the concerns raised by the defendant, which the\nGovernment has shared with defense counsel. The Government has also conferred with defense\ncounsel three times regarding the same, as well as the defense’s request relating to MDC Warden\nHeriberto Tellez. The parties have been unable to reach agreement. Our respective positions\nfollou.\n\nThe Government respectfully submits that the Court should allou MDC legal counsel to\nrespond directly in writing to the Court and defense counsel regarding the concerns defense\ncounsel has raised relating to the defendant’s conditions of confinement. The Government\nunderstands that MDC legal counsel is prepared to submit a leter by this Friday, December 4,\n2o2o. Such a leter is the appropriate next step at this time, as it will allou the Court to hear\ndirectly from MDC legal counsel who can address the defendant’s conditions of confinement. The\nleter will allou the Court to ascertain whether further inquiry, including a personal appearance by\nthe Warden or other MDC personnel, is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>. Moreover, the Government does not\nunderstand the concerns raised by the defense to implicate the defendant’s access to legal materials\nor her ability to communicate with her counsel. As noted in the Government’s leter dated\nNovember 23, 2o2o, the defendant continues to have more time to review her discovery than any\nother inmate at the MDC. The defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC\ninmate to communicate with her atorneys. (Dkt. No. 74).\n\nThe defense disagrees. As communicated to the Government, the defense’s position is as\nfollous: Warden Heriberto Tellez should appear before the Court to directly address concerns\nregarding Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement, which specifically target her. On October\n29, 2o2o, the defense emailed a leter to Warden Tellez detailing the onerous and restrictive\nconditions, including but not limited to concerns regarding the supplemental camera; excessive\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool345\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001349.jpg": "CaSesb:2o-cr/oo8BGHAU Ant B6euMent B2o FiledOV2/oB2C aPage fast 2 ;\nUSDC SDNY\nDOCUMENT\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #:\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DATE FILED: l2/8/2o\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nWe write on behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, to respectfully request that the Court\norder the Bureau of Prisons to give Ms. Maxwell access to the laptop computer provided by the\ngovernment so that she can review discovery on weekends and holidays.\n\nAt the request of defense counsel, the government provided Ms. Maxwell with a laptop\ncomputer to review the voluminous discovery, which was produced on a series of external hard\ndrives. Currently, Ms. Maxwell is given access to the laptop only on weekdays. On weekends\nand holidays, Ms. Maxwell must use the prison computer on her floor to review discovery.\nHouever, the prison computer is not equipped with the software <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to read large portions\nof the discovery recently produced by the government. As a result, Ms. Maxwell loses several\ndays of review time every weekend and every holiday because she does not have access to the\nlaptop. If Ms. Maxwell is to have any hope of reviewing the millions of documents produced in\ndiscovery so that she can properly prepare her defense by the July l2, 2o2l trial date, she must\nhave access to the laptop every day, including weekends and holidays.\n\nDefense counsel has raised this issue with the government and it has no objection to Ms.\nMaxwell having access to the laptop seven days a week. At the request of defense counsel, the\ngovernment has contacted officials at the MDC on several occasions in the past few weeks to\nrequest that they lift this restriction, but without success.\n\nThere is no principled justification for this restriction. Ms. Maxwell was given access to\nthe laptop every day (including weekends and the Thanksgiving holiday) for the entire l4-day\nperiod that she was quarantined in her isolation cell in November-December 2o2o because she had\ncome into close contact with a member of the MDC staff who had tested positive for COVID. In\naddition, the laptop is kept in a locker in the same room where the prison computer is located, so it\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool35l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001358.jpg": "CaSesb:2o-cr/oo8BG+ANAt B6caMeent 4/282 Filed/o7/o5/PagPage 22af 2\nPage 2\nbefore being provided to the inmate recipient. Due to the large number of MDC inmates and the\nvolume of mail received at the MDC, this process can take multiple days. As noted above,\nhouever, the defendant is able to send and receive emails with defense counsel every day and has\nregular communication with counsel via VTC.\n\nMDC staff conduct two pat-doun searches of the defendant per day: once when she is\nmoved from her isolation cell to the day room each morning, and once when returns from the day\nroom to her isolation cell each night. As part of those searches, the defendant is required to remove\nher mask and open her mouth briefly so that MDC staff, who remain masked during the searches,\ncan confirm she has not hidden contraband in her mouth. These pat-doun and mouth searches are\nconsistent with MDC’s policy that all inmates be searched whenever they move to a different\nlocation within the jail facility. Previously, the defendant atended VTC conferences in a separate\npart of the MDC, requiring that she be searched when taken to and from her VTC calls with\ncounsel. Recently, houever, the MDC changed the location of the defendant’s VTC calls so that\nthe defendant does not need to leave her unit in order to atend VTC calls with her counsel, thereby\nreducing the number of searches. During the suspension of visitation, the defendant has not been\nstrip searched. When visitation resumes, the defendant, like all other inmates, will be strip\nsearched after any in-person visit.\n\nIn addition, MDC staff search the defendant’s cell for contraband once per day. MDC staff\nalso conduct a body scan on the defendant once per week to check for any secreted contraband.\nAt night, MDC staff are required to confirm that the defendant is not in distress every fifteen\nminutes. To do so, staff point a flashlight to the ceiling of the defendant’s cell to illuminate the\ncell sufficiently to confirm that the defendant is breathing every fifteen minutes. The MDC\ncontinues to assess that these searches are all <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for the safety of the institution and the\ndefendant.\n\nShould the Court have any questions or require any additional details regarding this topic,\nthe Government will promptly provide additional information.\n\nRespectfully submited,\nAUDREY STRAUSS\nUnited States Atorney\nMaurene Comey / Alison Moe / Lara Pomerantz\nAssistant United States Atorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nTel: (2l2) 637-2324\nCc: All Counsel of Record (By ECF)\nDOJ-OGR-ooool358\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001362.jpg": "CaSesb:2o-cr/oo8BG+ANNt B6euMesnt 296 2 Filed/O4/o6/PagPage 42a 6\nPage 4\n\nshe returns to the day room from the scan area. As part of every pat-doun search, the defendant\nis required to remove her mask and open her mouth briefly so that MDC staff, who remain masked\nduring the searches, can confirm she has not hidden contraband in her mouth.” These pat-doun\nand mouth searches are consistent with MDC’s policy that all inmates be searched whenever they\nmove to a different location within the jail facility. In the absence of in-person visitation, the\ndefendant has not been strip searched. If the defendant receives in-person visits, then she, like all\nother inmates, will be strip searched after any in-person visit.\n\nIn addition, MDC staff search the defendant’s cell for contraband once per day. At night,\nMDC staff are required to confirm every fifteen minutes that the defendant is not in distress. To\ndo so, every fifteen minutes, staff point a flashlight to the concrete ceiling of the defendant’s cell\nto illuminate the cell sufficiently to confirm that the defendant is breathing. At night, MDC staff\nhave observed that the defendant wears an eye mask when she sleeps, limiting the disturbance\ncaused by the flashlight. Additionally, MDC staff have observed that the defendant regularly\nsleeps through these nightime wellness checks. The MDC continues to be of the view that all of\nthese searches are <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for the safety of the institution and the defendant.\n\nThe Government also inquired regarding certain complaints defense counsel raised in\nFebruary 2o2l regarding the defendant’s food, water, and physical wellbeing. In response, MDC\n> Follouing defense counsel’s complaint in its February l6, 2o2l leter of an inappropriately\nconducted pat-doun search, the MDC conducted an investigation and found that, contrary to the\ndefendant’s claim, the search in question was in fact recorded in full by a handheld camera. After\nreviewing the camera footage, the MDC concluded that the search was conducted appropriately\nand the defendant’s complaint about that incident was unfounded. MDC legal counsel further\nconfirmed that all pat-doun searches of the defendant are video recorded. Follouing this incident,\nMDC staff directed the defendant to clean her cell because it had become very dirty. Among other\nthings, MDC staff noted that the defendant frequently did not flush her toilet after using it, which\ncaused the cell to smell. In addition, the defendant had not cleaned her cell in some time, causing\nthe cell to become increasingly dirty. MDC staff directed the defendant to clean her cell in\nresponse to the smell and the dirtiness, not as retaliation for complaining about a particular search.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool362\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001376.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 57, o4/l9/2o2l, 3o8o288, Page4 of 3o\n\nThe Government makes much of the fact that its Indictment is\n“speaking.” But speaking or not, an indictment is not a substitute for\nevidence and cannot be used as proof that the case is strong.

Although defense counsel have not yet been able to fully review the\nmaterials, which are voluminous, it is apparent that the witness interviews contain exculpatory or\notherwise favorable information for Ms. Maxwell, which the defense has an obligation to\ninvestigate. A number of these witnesses may testify as part of the defense case. Even if defense\ncounsel were to atempt to contact and interview only a small number of these witnesses and\nconduct any <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> follou-up investigation, that would still take a significant amount of time\nto complete. Thus, while we appreciate receiving these materials, the disclosure has not\ndecreased the amount of time the defense will need to investigate; indeed, it has increased it.\n\nIt is also disingenuous for the government to argue that because it previously provided\ndiscovery regarding the new charges no additional time is required to prepare the defense of the\nnew indictment. When the parties were originally negotiating a discovery schedule for the\noriginal indictment, the government represented that it would be providing, in an abundance of\ncaution, a significant amount of discovery from Epstein’s seized electronic devices that\ncontained information that it was not relying on in Ms. Maxwell’s case. The government\nreiterated this point in its November 6, 2o2o leter to the Court requesting additional time to\nfinish producing discovery. (See Dkt. 69 at 4 (“|OJf the approximately l.2 million documents,\nonly a handful were specifically relied upon by the Government in the investigation that led the\ncharges in the current indictment.”). These devices contain over 2.4 million pages of material,\nvirtually none of which pertained to the time period of the original indictment. Nou that the\nsuperseding indictment has expanded the time period of the alleged conduct well into the 2ooos,\nthe 2.4 million pages that were not previously relevant are nou pertinent, requiring re-review and\nanalysis.!\n\n' The actual number of pages is, in fact, larger than 2.4 million.

A//\ncounsel have been laboring under the difficulties caused by this unprecedented circumstance.\nThe government’s challenges pale in comparison to those experienced by the defense.\nDefending quarter-century-old allegations has required investigation across this country and\naround the world. Investigating the new allegations will require the same efforts and diligence.\nIt is laughable for the government to use COVID as an excuse for its delay in superseding the\nindictment and then oppose any continuance for the defense. Defense preparation is not immune\nto the impact of the pandemic.\nA Trial Continuance is <span class=\"highlight\">Necessary</span>\n\nWhile the government’s offer to provide discovery highlights and its representation that it\nwill streamline its case to primarily focus on the four accusers are helpful, these gestures do not\neliminate the need for a continuance. As set forth above, the government’s hyperbolic claim that\nit can “ensure that the defense will be fully prepared to proceed to trial on July l2, 2o2l” (Govt\nItr at 4-5) ignores the reality that time is needed to:\n\n= supplement pending pretrial motions;\n\n* critically review voluminous discovery produced in November 2o2o that the\ngovernment represented was not relevant to the case against Ms. Maxwell;\n\n= re-review discovery for the new time period and charges;\n\n= commence new investigations based on the new charges and the government’s\ndisclosure of 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses; and\n\n« refocus trial preparation and strategy.\n\nThe government originally represented to the Court and counsel that this trial would last\ntwo weeks. The government nou predicts the trial will last a month.

Even if the case were tried on the previous indictment on July l2th, carving off any time\nrequired for trial preparation is unwarranted and unfair.\n\nA continuance is justified based on the second superseding indictment. The new charges\nup the ante and double Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing exposure. To deny her a continuance\nundercuts her constitutional right to a fair trial and effective assistance of counsel. A\ncontinuance - the need for which is caused solely by the government - is reasonable and\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> in defense of Ms. Maxwell. The denial of a continuance risks a miscarriage of justice.\nDespite Its Necessity, A Continuance Further Prejudices Ms. Maxwell\n\nA delay of the July l2 trial especially one that accommodates counsel’s other trial\nschedules — has a direct and deleterious impact on Ms. Maxwell as a result of her continued\ndetention, the details of which are well knoun to the Court. In addition to her prolonged\ndetention, she is the victim on ongoing hostile media reporting which impacts the ability to seat\nfair and impartial jurors.\n\nOn April 26\", Second Circuit will hear oral argument on Ms. Maxwell’s bail appeal and\nmay moot any need for a further bail application. Nonetheless, Ms. Maxwell reserves her right to\nseek a bail hearing depending on the Circuit’s decision.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool395\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001410.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 7o-l, o5/l7/2o2l, 3lo245o, Page4 of l4\nof sleep would alleviate her stress instead of exacerbate it.

Tellingly,\n3 Maxwell repeatedly accuses the Government of making misrepresentations during\nthe course of this case.

To the contrary, when asked whether the nightime checks were\nconducted at that interval for every inmate, Government counsel clarified, “I can’t\nspeak to what is done as to all inmates.” Only after conferring with the MDC did\nthe Government convey to Judge Nathan, and nou this Court, the MDC’s procedures\nfor nightime checks of all inmates.

On July 2, 2o2o,\nthe defendant was arrested in Bradford, New Hampshire on the charges contained in the above-\ncaptioned Indictment and presented before a United States Magistrate Judge in the District of New\nHampshire. At that appearance, the defendant waived her right to an identity hearing, consented\nto detention without prejudice to making a later application for bail, and consented to her transfer\nto the Southern District of New York.\n\nWhile the Government has no control over the timing of the defendant’s transport, the\nGovernment understands from the United States Marshals Service (“USMS”) that the USMS is\nacting expeditiously to transport the defendant into this District. In particular, the Government\nunderstands that the USMS expects that the defendant will arrive in this District early this week,\nwell within the ten days contemplated by the Speedy Trial Act for transfer of a defendant from\nanother district. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(l)(F).\n\nThe Government has consulted with defense counsel, Christian Everdell, Esq., who has\nrequested that the arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing in this mater take place on July\nlo, 2o2o. In advance of that proceeding, the parties jointly request that the defense be permited\nto file a writen bail application to the Court by 3:oo p.m. on July 9, 2o2o, and that the Government\nbe permited to file a writen reply by l2:oo p.m. on July lo, 2o2o. If that schedule is acceptable\nto the Court, the parties respectfully request that the Court schedule an arraignment, initial\nappearance, and bail hearing in this mater for the afternoon of July lo, 2o2o.\n\nAdditionally, the Government respectfully requests that the Court exclude time under the\nSpeedy Trial Act between the defendant’s arrest on July 2, 2o2o and the date of the arraignment,\ninitial appearance, and bail hearing before Your Honor.

The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that a court “shail order the pretrial release” of the defendant (l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(b))\n(emphasis added), but may impose bail conditions if “such release will not reasonably assure the\nappearance” of the defendant in court. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c).

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully request that the Court enter a\nprotective order in the form atached hereto as Exhibit A.\n\nThe government has indicated that it requires the entry of a protective order before\nproducing any discovery material to Ms. Maxwell. On July 9, 2o2o, the government provided\ndefense counsel with an initial draft of a proposed protective order. Since that time, the parties\nhave conferred several times on conference calls and by email, and have been able to reach\nagreement on almost all of the provisions of the proposed protective order.\n\nTwo key disputes remain, houever, which require the Court’s guidance. First, the\ndefense believes that potential government witnesses and their counsel should be subject to the\nsame restrictions as the defense concerning appropriate use of the discovery materials—namely,\nif these individuals are given access to discovery materials during trial preparation, they may not\nuse those materials for any purpose other than preparing for trial in the criminal case, and may\nnot post those materials on the Internet. Second, the defense believes it should not be restricted\nfrom publicly disclosing or disseminating the identity of any alleged victims or potential\nwitnesses referenced in the discovery materials who have already identified themselves by\nspeaking on the public record.\n\nAs set forth belou, we believe that the proposed protective order contains appropriate\nrestrictions that are no broader than <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to protect the privacy interests of individuals\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool643\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001644.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 29 Filed o7/27/2o Page 2 of 4\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 27, 2o2o\nPage 2\nreferenced in the discovery and guard against prejudicial pretrial publicity, while still ensuring\nthat Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel may adequately prepare and present a full defense at trial.\nLegal Standard\n\nWhere the government seeks to curtail the use of pretrial discovery, Rule l6(d)(l) of the\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires that it “shou good cause for the issuance of a\nprotective order.” United States v. Annabi, No. lo Cr. 7 (CM), 2olo WL l25322l, at *l\n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2olo). To establish that good cause exists for proposed restrictions in a\nprotective order, the government must shou that disclosure will cause “a clearly defined and\nserious injury.” United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d l94, 2ll (3d Cir. 2oo7). A finding of harm\n“must be based on a particular factual demonstration of potential harm, not on conclusory\nstatements.” United States v. Gangi, l998 WL 226l96, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 4, l998) (citations\nand internal quotations omited). “Broad allegations of harm, unsubstantiated by specific\nexamples or articulated reasoning, do not support a good cause shouing.” Wecht, 484 F.3d at\n2ll.\n\nCourts must be careful not to impose a protective order that is “broader than is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>”\nto accomplish its goals. United States v. Lindh, l98 F. Supp. 2d 739, 742 (E.D. Va. 2oo2)\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited). Thus, courts are instructed to “weigh the\nimpact” of requested protections and their extent against a defendant’s “due process right to\nprepare and present a full defense at trial.” Jd.\n\nDiscussion\n\nl. Restrictions on Use of Discovery Materials\n\nThe government and the defense agree that the protective order should include a\nrestriction prohibiting Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel from (i) using discovery materials “for\nany civil proceeding or any purpose” other than defending or preparing for this criminal action;\nor (i) posting discovery materials on the Internet. See Ex. A ff l(a), 5. The defense’s proposed\nprotective order would make those same restrictions applicable to potential government\nwitnesses and their counsel so that they are on equal footing with the defense. See Ex. A {¥ 3, 5.\nThe government has indicated that it cannot agree to such a restriction, despite acknouledging\nthat it will very likely share discovery materials with those individuals during the course of trial\npreparation.\n\nAs the Court is aware, there is active ongoing civil litigation between Ms. Maxwell and\nmany of the government’s potential witnesses. Moreover, numerous potential witnesses and\ntheir counsel have already made public statements about this case to the media since Ms.\nMaxwell’s arrest. There is a substantial concern that these individuals will seek to use discovery\nmaterials to support their civil cases and future public statements. It is therefore vital that the\ngovernment’s potential witnesses and their counsel be subject to the same restrictions as Ms.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool644\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001645.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 29 Filed o7/27/2o Page 3 of 4\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 27, 2o2o\nPage 3\nMaxwell with respect to using the criminal discovery material solely for the purpose of this\ncriminal case.\n\na, Victim/Witness Identities\n\nMs. Maxwell’s proposed protective order prohibits Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and\nothers on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity of any alleged victim or\npotential witness referenced in the discovery materials, but does not prohibit defense counsel\nfrom publicly referencing individuals “who have spoken on the public record to the media or in\npublic fora, or in litigation—criminal or otherwise—relating to Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine\nMaxwell.” Jd. § 6. This language, which is nearly identical in all material respects to the\nlanguage in the protective order approved in the government’s criminal prosecution of Mr.\nEpstein, see United States v. Epstein, l9-CR-oo49o-RMB (S.D.N.Y. July 25, 2ol9), ensures\nappropriate privacy protections for alleged victims and should be approved here.\n\nIn contrast to the more permissive language it agreed to with respect to Mr. Epstein, the\ngovernment has taken the position that Ms. Maxwell’s defense counsel should only be alloued to\ndisclose the identity of alleged victims or potential witnesses who have spoken by name on the\npublic record “in this case.” The government’s proposal, houever, advances no compelling\nprivacy protections, and instead prevents the defense from making reference to individuals who\nhave already voluntarily publicly disclosed their identities by, among other things, pursuing civil\nsuits in their oun name against Ms. Maxwell and/or Mr. Epstein; speaking by name in the public\nrecord in Mr. Epstein’s criminal proceedings; participating in on-the-record media interviews; or\nposting comments under their oun names on social media. The government’s proposed\nrestriction is therefore “broader than <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>” to protect the privacy interests of these\nindividuals who have already chosen to self-identify, and will hinder the defense’s ability to\nconduct further factual investigation, prepare witnesses for trial, and advocate on Ms. Maxwell’s\nbehalf.\n\n* * *\nDOJ-OGR-ooool645\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001648.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 29-l Filed o7/27/2o Page 2 of l3\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\n~e ee ee eee LLL LL\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA ° PROVE CPT vn ONDER\n- 7, = :\n2o Cr. 33o (AUN)\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, :\nDefendant. :\n~e ee ee eee LLL LL\nALISON J.

Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 2\nThe defendant’s demand that she and her counsel be permited to name any individuals who have\never publicly identified themselves as a victim of either Epstein or the defendant in any “public\nfora,” and at any time, without limitation, is extraordinarily broad, unnecessary, and inappropriate,\nand should be denied.\n\nAs an initial mater, there can be no serious question that there are significant privacy and\nvictim interests at issue here, which the Government Proposed Order seeks to protect. Particularly\nin the context of victim witnesses, there are compelling reasons to limit public disclosure of victim\nidentities and other sensitive information. Indeed, the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, l8 U.S.C. §\n377l, requires district courts to implement procedures to ensure that crime victims are accorded,\namong other rights, “[t]he right to be reasonably protected from the accused,” in addition to “[t]he\nright to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy.” Id. §§\n(a)(l), (a)(8) (emphasis added). Moreover, “the public generally has a strong interest in protecting\nthe identities of . . . victims so that other victims will not be deterred from reporting such crimes.”\nUnited States v. Paris, 2oo7 WL l484974, at *2 (D. Conn. May l8, 2oo7).\n\nMoreover, and consistent with those interests, courts in this Circuit have routinely\nacknouledged the need to protect victim-witness identities. See, e.g., United States v. Corley,\nl3 Cr. 48 (AJN), 2ol6 WL 9o225o8, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6) (“Because Corley’s minor\nvictims have significant privacy and safety interests at stake, while Corley’s interests are minimal,\nthe Court finds good cause to modify the protective order in this case to prevent Corley from\nlearning the surnames of the minor victims.”); United States v. Kelly, o7 Cr. 374 (SJ), 2oo8 WL\n5o6882o, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. July lo, 2oo8) (“Given the potentially explicit nature of the government\nwitnesses’ expected testimony, the government argues that it is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to conceal their identity\nto protect them from public humiliation and embarrassment. This Court agrees. Thus, the parties\n[. . .] are hereby prohibited from releasing to anyone, including members of the press, the identity\nor any identifying information of the government’s witnesses.”). It is similarly routine in this\nDistrict for parties in a criminal case to refer to witnesses by pseudonyms (such as “Victim-l” or\n‘“‘Witness-l’’) to protect the privacy interests of third parties unless and until they testify publicly.\n\nThe Government’s proposed order endeavors to protect those interests by generally\nrequiring the parties to abstain from identifying any victim by name in any public statement or\nfiling while also ensuring that the defendant and her counsel are fully able to prepare for trial.\nIndeed, to facilitate the defendant’s investigation and preparation for trial, the Government’s\nproposal makes clear that defense counsel and defense staff, including defense investigators,\nshould not be prohibited from referencing identities of individuals in conversations with\nprospective witnesses, so long as those witnesses and their counsel abstain from further disclosing\nor disseminating any such identities. See Government Proposed Order § 5. The terms of the\nGovernment’s proposed order also would permit defense counsel to refer to any individual by\nname in any filing under seal, merely requiring redaction of identifying information or the use of\na pseudonym in public filings. The Government further proposes that defense counsel not be\nprohibited from publicly referencing individuals who have spoken—or who at some future time\nor deletes language in furtherance of its desire to publicly reference victim identities in defense\nparagraphs 7, 9, and l7 (which are Government Proposed Order paragraphs 6, 7, and l6).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool665\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001666.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 33 Filed o7/28/2o Page 3 of 7\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 3\nspeak—by name on the public record in this case, as one victim has already chosen to do, because\nthose victims, and only those victims, have affirmatively chosen to be publicly identified in\nconnection with this case. These proposals are reasonable, narrouly tailored, and not broader than\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to protect victims’ privacy interests, safety, and well-being, to avoid potential\nharassment of witnesses by the press and others, and to prevent undue embarrassment and other\nadverse consequences. At this stage in the case, permiting defense counsel to refer to witnesses\nby name in sealed filings, to refer to witnesses by name in the course of private conversations\nduring their investigation, and to refer by name to individuals who have made the affirmative\nchoice to be identified by name in connection with this criminal case is more than enough to enable\nthe defendant ability to vigorously pursue her defense.\n\nThe defendant has rejected this proposal because, as noted above, she believes that she and\nher counsel should be permited to “publicly referenc[e]” individuals, by name, who have “spoken\non the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation — criminal or otherwise — relating\nto Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” In support of the defendant’s application for such\nsweeping ability to publicly name any such individuals, defense counsel provides only the\nconclusory assertion that an inability to publicly reference the names of victims, in court\nproceedings and beyond, will hinder their ability to investigate, prepare witnesses for trial, and\nadvocate on the defendant’s behalf. The Government has repeatedly asked defense counsel to\nexplain hou or why it would need to publicly name victims of sexual abuse to prepare for trial,\nand the defense repeatedly has declined to do so, presumably because the argument borders on the\nabsurd.”\n\nThe Government’s proposed protective order would do no such thing. As described above,\nthe Government’s proposed order would permit defense counsel and defense staff to reference the\nidentities of individuals they believe may be relevant to the defense to potential witnesses and their\ncounsel (who then would be prohibited from further disclosing or disseminating such identifying\ninformation). Government Proposed Order 45. It would further permit the defendant to publicly\nidentify individuals who have chosen to speak on the record on this case. Jd. 9.6. And it would\npermit the defendant to reference identifying information in filings made under seal. See id.\n\n> Despite the Government’s requests for clarity on the need for the defendant’s requested\nmodification, the sole additional reason provided by defense counsel for why it would be\nappropriate or <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to publicly name victims is that certain of these victims have obtained\nwhat defense counsel described as the “benefit” of publicly identifying themselves as victims (and\nthus, as the defendant presumably would have it, deserve whatever public identification and\nscrutiny the defendant intends to invite upon them). Beyond the offensive notion that victims of\nsexual abuse experience a “benefit” by making the incredibly difficult decision to share their\nexperience publicly, the suggestion that victims who receive this supposed “benefit” should\nreceive fewer protections than the law ordinarily offers to victims in criminal cases is alarming.\nPermiting defense counsel to publicly identify witnesses who have not identified themselves on\nthe record in this case risks subjecting witnesses to harassment and intimidation, with no\nconceivable benefit to the defense other than perhaps discouraging witnesses from cooperating\nwith the Government.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool666\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001667.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 33 Filed o7/28/2o Page 4 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 28, 2o2o\nPage 4\n\nMoreover, the defendant is able, at any time, to apply to the Court for a modification of the\nprotective order should she be able to identify a particularized need to publicly name victims who\nhave not yet identified themselves on the record in this case—as opposed to redacting their names\nfrom court filings, or referring to them in an anonymized fashion. As noted, to date, defense\ncounsel has declined to identify to the Court or to the Government any example of why doing so\nwould be <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> or helpful to the defense, or even under what circumstances the defense might\nwant to do so.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal is also extraordinarily broad, and without any temporal or subject\nmater limitation as to the phrase “public fora.” Adopting the defendant’s proposal would mean\nthat any individual who has ever self-identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell\npublicly in any capacity would be subject to public identification by the defendant and her counsel\nin connection with this case. This would include, as hypothetical examples, someone who spoke\nto a journalist for a local story in l997, or posted on a MySpace page folloued by a handful of\nfriends in 2oo5, or made a statement on a small podcast in 2oo9, or posted on Twiter to a handful\nof follouers in 2ol3. But none of these examples of ventures into the “public fora” can possibly\nbe construed as efforts by hypothetical victims to consent or choose “‘to self-identify,” Def. Ltr.\nat 3, in a future criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell subject to extraordinary public atention\nand scrutiny.\n\nAdditionally, while some individuals have identified themselves as victims without\nproviding any details or additional information about their abuse, the defense contemplates no\nlimitation of publicly associating those individuals with the details of their abuse in public defense\nstatements or filings. In essence, the defendant’s proposal seeks authorization to drag into the\npublic glare any victim who has ever made any type of public statement of victimization—no\nmater hou long ago or hou brief—without that victim’s knouing consent and without any\nsubstantive justification. That is particularly troubling given that the Government expects to make\nproductions of discovery and 35oo materials well surpassing its obligations. Those productions\nwill necessarily include the identities of individuals whom the Government does not expect to call\nas witnesses, and whose accounts—much less identities—will have no bearing on this case. But\nthe defendant’s proposal would allou her and her counsel to publicly name them in any public\nstatement or filing at their sole discretion. This is plainly unnecessary for any investigative steps\nor trial preparation, would be grossly inappropriate and unfair, and would be inconsistent with the\nCrime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nConversely, the Government’s submission proposes that the defendant and her counsel not\nbe precluded from discussing publicly individuals who identify themselves on the record in this\ncriminal prosecution, because any such individuals will have made a conscious and informed\nchoice to be associated publicly with this case. See Government Proposed Order {/f 5, 6, 8. The\nidentity of any other individuals should be protected from public broadcast by the defendant and\nher counsel.\n\nThe defendant argues that her proposed language is “nearly identical in all material\nrespects” to the protective order entered in United States v.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this leter to reply to\nthe government’s response leter and submission regarding the proposed protective order in the\nabove-captioned case, dated July 28, 2o2o (“Government’s Response” or “Gov’t Resp.”) (Dkt.\n33).\n\nThe parties have met and conferred, resolving nearly all the issues relating to the\nproposed protective order. The parties agree that there are two areas of dispute as to which we\nrequire guidance from the Court. As noted in our opening leter and belou, we respectfully\nsubmit that the arguments made by the government are unavailing, and that the defense’s\nproposed protective order, atached as Exhibit A to our initial submission (Dkt. 29), should be\nentered by the Court.\n\nl. Referencing Individuals Who Have Publicly Identified Themselves\n\nThe starting point for evaluating the scope of a proposed protective order is whether there\nare valid privacy interests at issue. It is the government’s burden to establish “good cause” that\ndisclosure will cause “a clearly defined and serious injury.” United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d\nl94, 2ll (3d Cir. 2oo7) (citation omited). The Court should also ensure that the proposed\nrestriction is “no broader than is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>” to protect that interest, and must consider the impact\nthat the restriction may have “on a defendant’s due process right to prepare and present a full\ndefense at trial.” United States v. Lindh, l98 F. Supp. 2d 739, 742 (E.D. Va. 2oo2). Throughout\nits leter, the government inverts this standard, claiming that the burden is on the defense (which,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool685\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001689.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 35 Filed o7/29/2o Page5of5\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 29, 2o2o\nPage 5\n\nBut this argument misses the point. The defense does not seek to impose any restrictions\non the government’s ability to share discovery materials with prospective witnesses and their\ncounsel in whatever manner it deems <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> and appropriate. Instead, the defense is seeking\na restriction, not on the government, but on what the prospective witnesses and their counsel can\ndo with those materials in the interest of fairness to the defendant.\n\nThe government argues that the defense’s proposal should be rejected because there does\nnot appear to be a similar precedent. (/d. at 6). But the defense’s proposal is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> given the\nuncommon circumstances of this case. Here, there are numerous women who may be witnesses\nin the government’s case who have simultaneously sued Ms. Maxwell, alleging the same conduct\nas that alleged in the indictment. Indeed, the criminal case and the civil cases are already\nintertwined because significant portions of the indictment appear to be based on a 2ol9 civil\ncomplaint filed against Ms. Maxwell by one of her accusers. Many of the accusers have also\nrepeatedly made public allegations against Ms. Maxwell in the press and on social media. The\ndefense has a legitimate concern that these individuals and their counsel will impermissibly use\nany discovery materials that are shared with them in this case to bolster their civil cases or to run\nto the press. As such, it is appropriate for the Court to require that the government’s witnesses\nand their counsel, like the defendant and defense counsel, must use the discovery materials only\nfor the purpose of preparing the criminal case.\n\n* * *\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, and in our opening leter, we respectfully submit that the\n\nCourt should enter the defendant’s proposed protective order.\nRespectfully submited,\n\n/s/ Christian R.

And as the Government’s leter notes, see Dkt.

The\nrequest appears unprecedented despite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal\nmaters that had related civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions\nincluding Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and\nother policies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously follou.\nFurthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential witnesses with\nmaterials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt. No. 33 at 6. And of\ncourse, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to examination on the record as to\nwhat materials were provided or shoun to them by the Government.

Nathan\n\nAugust l3, 2o2o\n\nPage 2\nprotective order was docketed on Friday, July 3l, 2o2o'—the timing of which was principally the\nresult of the defendant’s oun refusal to agree to the terms of the proposed protective order. The\nGovernment then promptly produced an initial discovery production totaling more than l2,ooo\npages the follouing Wednesday, August 5, 2o2o. Additionally, the Government continues to\nproduce discovery and earlier today made a second production, as the Government advised defense\ncounsel last week it intended to do, totaling more than l5o,ooo pages, principally consisting of\nfinancial records.” Although the Government expects to continue to produce a large amount of\nelectronic discovery, the two productions already made constitute the vast majority of initial\ndiscovery, including search warrant applications and subpoena returns, which the Government has\nnou produced more than a week in advance of its deadline of August 2l, 2o2o, and\napproximately ll months prior to trial.\n\nIn sum, the Government has acted expeditiously in meeting its initial discovery obligations,\nproviding more than l65,ooo pages of discovery materials in less than two weeks follouing the\nentry of the protective order—all of which was accompanied by detailed indices describing the\ngeneral topics and sources of the materials.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Defense Leter claims that over the course of just five days,\ndefense counsel determined, having “expeditiously reviewed [the discovery] for high level\ncontent,” Def. Ltr. at 2, that they cannot possibly investigate the charges against their client based\non the materials provided thus far, and asking the Court to order the Government to provide the\ndefendant with a partial witness list. That request should be denied.\n\nTellingly, the defendant cites no authority that requires the relief requested at this stage in\nthe litigation—i.e., prior to the completion of discovery and approximately ll months before\ntrial—nor is the Government aware of any. For example, in the lead case cited by defense counsel,\nUnited States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 3ol (2d Cir. l975), although the opinion acknouledged\nthe ability of district courts to compel disclosure of the identity of government witnesses, the\nSecond Circuit reversed for abuse of discretion the district court’s decision to do so in that case\nbecause the defendant there, as here, had made “only an abstract, conclusory claim that such\ndisclosure was <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to its proper preparation for trial.” /d. at 3ol-o2. In United States v.\nRueb, oo Cr. o9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at *8 (S.D.N.Y.

The requested redactions and\nsealing would thus be <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to ensure compliance with those sealing orders and is justified\nbased upon them.” Cf Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l8 n.9 (l979)\n(“Since the l7th century, grand jury proceedings have been closed to the public; and records of\nsuch proceedings have been kept from the public eye. The rule of grand jury secrecy ... is an\nintegral part of our criminal justice system.”).\n\nAssuming without agreeing that these materials constitute “judicial documents” within the\nmeaning of First Amendment right-of-access jurisprudence, such a determination would not be\ndispositive. The First Amendment presumptive right of access applies to civil and criminal\nproceedings and “protects the public against the government’s arbitrary interference with access\nto important information.” N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth. (“NYCTA”), 684\nF.3d 286, 298 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (internal quotation marks omited). The Circuit has applied two\ndifferent approaches when deciding whether the First Amendment right applies to particular\nmaterial. The “experience-and-logic” approach asks “both whether the documents have\nhistorically been open to the press and general public and whether public access plays a significant\npositive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l2o (2d Cir. 2oo6) (internal quotation marks omited). The second\napproach—employed when analyzing judicial documents related to judicial proceedings covered\nby the First Amendment right—asks whether the documents at issue “‘are derived from or are a\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> corollary of the capacity to atend the relevant proceedings.” /d. (internal quotation\nmarks and alteration omited).\n\nEven when it applies, the First Amendment right creates only a presumptive right of access,\nand the “presumption is rebutable upon demonstration that suppression ‘is essential to preserve\nhigher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that interest.’” Hartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino,\n38o F.3d 83, 96 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (quoting Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Riverside\nCnty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5lo(l984)) (internal citation omited). “What offends the First Amendment\nis the atempt to [exclude the public] without sufficient justification,” NYCTA, 684 F.3d at 296,\nnot the simple act of exclusion itself. Thus, the presumptive right of access may be overcome by\n“specific, on-the-record findings that sealing is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to preserve higher values and only if the\nsealing order is narrouly tailored to achieve that aim.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l24.\n\n* The only exceptions to those sealing orders are the permission contained in a certain order issued\nin April 2ol9, namely that the order itself may be provided to the recipient of a subpoena, and,\npursuant to separate permissions the Government has obtained in connection with its discovery\nobligations, that the entirety of the relevant filings may be provided to the defendant as discovery\nin this criminal case.\nDOJ-OGR- ooool738\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001745.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 49 Filed o8/25/2o Page 3 of 4\nMaxwell the same privileges given to other detainees.” Dkt.

Dkt. No. 4l at 4n.5. And as to the more general implementation of\nsurveillance procedures, the Court credits BOP’s duty to ensure the safety and security of the\nDefendant as justifying the measures BOP has adopted.

The defense cites no authority for such a broad\ninterpretation of Brady, nor is the Government aware of any. To the contrary, the well-established\nlaw of this Circuit generally precludes a defendant from offering evidence that a defendant did not\nparticipate in criminal conduct on a particular occasion—or of her law-abiding conduct during\nuncharged periods or uncharged events—to rebut the Government’s evidence with respect to the\ncharged crimes or events. See, e.g., United States v. Scarpa, 897 F.2d 63, 7o (2d Cir. l99o) (“A\ndefendant may not seek to establish h[er] innocence . . . through proof of the absence of criminal\nacts on specific occasions.”); United States v.

Fiumano, No. l4 Cr. 5l8 (JFK), 2ol6 WL l629356, at\n*7 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 25, 2ol6) (“The principle is rather elementary. A defendant charged with\nrobbing a bank in Manhatan on April 22 cannot offer as evidence to disprove the charged crime\nthat he did not rob the bank’s branches in Brooklyn or the Bronx on April 22 or that he did not rob\nthe Manhatan branch on April 2o, 2l, 23, and 24, because this evidence is irrelevant to the charge\nthat he robbed the Manhatan bank on April 22.”); United States v. Gambino, 838 F. Supp. 744,\n748 (S.D.N.Y. l993) (“Defendants also claim that the Southern District was in possession of\nexculpatory materials which it did not disclose, namely that Gravano had discussed drug deals\nwith a number of ‘captains’ in the Gambino crime family, but had no such conversations with John\nGambino. Even if the Southern District had knouledge that Gravano had conversations with other\ncaptains about specific instances of drug crimes, the fact that Gravano did not have such\nconversations with Gambino does not make such evidence exculpatory. . . . Since a defendant\ncannot introduce evidence of innocent behavior on other occasions to prove his innocence, such\ntestimony would not be exculpatory within the requirements of Brady’).!\n\n' The implications of the defense’s proposed expansion of Brady would be sweeping. There\nare any number of cases in which a defendant is charged with participating in a criminal conspiracy\nfor a discrete period of time outside of which co-conspirators may have commited similar crimes\nwithout that defendant. Such a set of facts is common in, for example, racketeering conspiracies\nand narcotics conspiracies, in which defendants may conspire with each other for a certain period\nof time before and after which they commit similar crimes on their oun or with others. The fact\nthat a co-conspirator may continue to commit similar crimes after a defendant ceases participation\nin a charged conspiracy does not somehou exculpate the defendant who did not continue\nparticipating in those crimes. See, e.g., United States v. Flaharty, 295 F.3d l82, l92-93 (2d Cir.\n2oo2) (co-conspirators in narcotics case continued to commit crimes without defendant during\ndefendant’s incarceration); United States v.

An indictment that fails to\nallege the essential elements of the crime charged offends both the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\nSee Russell v. United States, 369 U.S. 749, 76o-6l (l962).\n\nMs. Maxwell recognizes that in most cases the bar for sufficiency of an indictment is\nvery lou. It is also true that courts find, in certain cases, that the discovery provided in\nconnection with the mater may cure various pleading deficiencies.

It also gives him sufficient\nprotection from a prosecution that would violate his rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause.”).\n\nThis, houever, is not those cases. Neither the indictment nor the discovery inform Ms.\nMaxwell about critical information <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to prepare her defense. For example, the discovery\nprovides no information about exactly when and where the alleged instances of sexual abuse\ntook place. Because there are no dates provided, other than a three-year period beginning 26\nyears in the past, Ms. Maxwell cannot properly investigate where she and other witnesses were\nwhen the alleged crime supposedly occurred. And because the crimes alleged in Counts One\nthrough Four are based largely on vaguely stated, non-criminal acts of so-called “grooming”\n(talking to or being nice to someone, or taking them to a movie), it is impossible to knou what\nact or acts she needs to defend against at trial.\n\nThe Discovery Provided to Date Contains No Corroborating Information and Omits\nExculpatory Evidence\n\nAt this point, roughly two months after the Government promised to produce the “core”\nof their evidence against Ms. Maxwell, their case appears to rest almost exclusively on claims of\nthree unidentified accusers, as to which they have not provided any detail about the dates or\nexact locations of the alleged encounters, or the specific acts taken by Ms. Maxwell.

Later that same day, the defense sent the Government a follou-up leter listing the\nunreadable documents and requesting that the Government immediately reproduce to Ms.\nMaxwell a new set of all of the discovery materials produced to date in a format that she could\naccess on her computer at the MDC, and shipped a new hard drive to load the replacement\nproduction.\n\nThe new hard drive was not made available to Ms. Maxwell at the MDC until the late\nafternoon of September 9, 2o2o, almost two weeks later.

On conference\ncalls on September 22, 2o2o and September 29, 2o2o, the Government advised that it was\nworking on resolving the issues, but that the defense could, in the meantime, create its oun\nlaptop computer with a copy of the production that it could bring to the MDC to review the\ndiscovery with Ms. Maxwell. The defense responded that, while it would create the laptop, it\nwas the Government’s responsibility to ensure that Ms. Maxwell had a complete set of readable\ndiscovery which she could access at the MDC herself, without defense counsel present.\n\nIt was not until October 2, 2o2o that the Government created a replacement set of the\nunreadable discovery, which it said it would include on the same hard drive as the next\nproduction of discovery materials. That production was only made available to Ms. Maxwell in\nthe MDC yesterday afternoon, almost three weeks since the production date. The Government\nalso advised that it had asked MDC legal counsel to send an IT staff member to examine the\ncomputer and load any <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> software to view the files on the existing hard drives. But the\nIT staff member did not look at the computer until October 7, and did not fix the problem.\nInstead, the IT staff member collected Ms. Maxwell’s computer and hard drives and kept them\nfor two days. When Ms. Maxwell inquired about them, the IT staff member said he had been too\nbusy to look at them. And when they were finally returned to Ms. Maxwell in the afternoon on\nOctober 9, several files were still unreadable. As of the date of this leter, Ms. Maxwell still does\nnot have a complete, readable set of the discovery produced to date, which severely impairs her\nability to prepare her defense. Accordingly, we ask the Court to order the Government to\naddress this problem immediately.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001818.jpg": "_ Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 69 Filed ll/o6/2o Page l of 4\neS U.S. Department of Justice\nwe United States Atorney\n\n- Southern District of New York\n\nThe Silvio J.

Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\nAO Foley Square\nNew York, New York looo7\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this leter in response\nto the Court’s order, dated November 25, 2o2o, directing Ms. Maxwell to justify why her leter\nof the same date requesting an in camera conference to discuss confidentiality concerns related\nto her Renewed Motion for Release on Bail (the “Motion”) should be sealed or redacted.\n\nWe continue to believe that sealing the November 25, 2o2o leter (the “November 25\"\nLeter”) in its entirety is warranted and appropriate under the governing case law. Houever, in\nresponse to the Court’s order, we ask the Court to file a redacted version of the November 25\nLeter, atached hereto as Exhibit A, which redacts only the information <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to protect\nthird parties from threats and harassment. In addition, because this leter must make reference to\nthe same confidential information contained in the November 25\" Leter in order to justify the\nproposed redactions, we further ask the Court to file a redacted version of this leter, atached as\nExhibit B. If the Court is not inclined to allou any of these redactions, we request leave to\nwithdraw both leters and refile the November 25\" Leter with the redacted sentences deleted.\n\nEvery submission related to the Motion, including this leter, presents the defense with a\nCatch-22. To support Ms. Maxwell’s position regarding sealing and confidentiality, we are\nasked to provide the Court with specific information about the people supporting Ms. Maxwell’s\nbail application and the need for sealing. But until we knou what confidentiality protections the\nCourt is willing to put in place, we are obligated to protect these people from the potentially\ndevastating consequences of being publicly identified by divulging as litle information about\nthem as possible. We therefore continue to believe that an in camera conference, atended by all\ncounsel, is the best way to address all of the confidentiality issues related to the Motion.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool855\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001856.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 87 Filed l2/o4/2o Page 2 of 4\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nNovember 3o, 2o2o\nPage 2\n\nWith regard to the November 25\" Leter, Ms. Maxwell requests redaction of three\nsentences. The first sentence must be redacted because it contains information that will identify\na proposed co-signer. The government, itself, concedes that such information should be\nredacted. (See November 25\" Leter at 3). The reference in this sentence to\n\nEven assuming, arguendo, that\nthere is some minimal public interest in knouing the identity of a particular surety, it is vastly\noutweighed by the significant privacy concerms in this case. See United States v. Amodeo, 7l\nF.3d lo44, lo5o-5l (2d Cir. l995) (“[t]he privacy interests of innocent third parties ... should\nweigh heavily in a court’s balancing equation.... [C]ourts have the pouer to insure that their\nrecords are not used to gratify private spite or promote public scandal[.]”).!\n\nSimilarly, redaction of the second and third sentences, like the first, is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to\nprotect the privacy and safety of people who have suffered, or legitimately fear they will suffer,\nterrible personal and professional consequences for having been linked to Ms. Maxwell. People\nclose to Ms. Maxwell have been physically stalked by members of the tabloid press and have had\n\naparazzi jump out of bushes and in front of their cars to snap pictures of them.\n\nAnd several have been the target of repeated physical threats. Many\nof the people who want to support Ms. Maxwell’s renewed bail application are older and do not\nhave the financial means to hire a personal security detail to protect themselves. Nor should they\nhave to. They are all people of good character who are simply trying to support Ms. Maxwell’s\nconstitutional right to seek release on bail. They should be given appropriate protections so that\nthey can step forward without having their lives upended or, worse, destroyed.\n\nThe November 25” Leter, as submited, intentionally avoided naming these individuals\nfor this very reason. But removing or redacting their names, as the government proposes, is not\nenough. This case has generated so much media atention and public opprobrium that public\nie.\n\n* Given the sensitive subject mater of this case, the sureties have legitimate fears for their safety if they are publicly\nidentified. Numerous social media posts have advocated killing Ms. Maxwell as a perverse form of “justice” for her\nalleged role in Epstein’s sex trafficking crimes. As we have all been recently reminded with the tragic case of the\ndeath of Judge Esther Salas’s son, there are people who are capable of commiting horrible acts of violence—even\nagainst innocent third parties—by convincing themselves that their actions are justified.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool856\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001857.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 87 Filed l2/o4/2o Page 3 of 4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

We are acutely mindful that courts are\ngenerally reluctant to seal anything in a court filing beyond what is required by statute or local\ncourt rules. We are therefore proposing targeted redactions, consistent with the case law in this\nCircuit, that are no more extensive than <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to protect these third parties. See Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onandaga, 435 F.3d llo, l24 (2d Cir. 2oo6); see also Unites States v. Wey, 256\nF. Supp. 3d 355, 4ll (S.D.N.Y. 2ol7) (Nathan, J.) (granting motion to seal evidentiary exhibits\non privacy grounds). Ultimately, we seek the same privacy protections for these people that the\ngovernment has sought and obtained for Ms. Maxwell’s accusers and for other information\ncovered by the Protective Order in this case.\n\nBy making this request for redaction, we are not trying to litigate this case in secret. We\nare merely seeking the ability to file a renewed bail application for Ms. Maxwell without further\nrisking the safety and privacy of sureties needed to support that application. This is the first of\nseveral confidentiality issues that will arise in connection with the Motion, and the sureties will\nbe looking at the Court’s ruling as an indication of the level of confidentiality they can expect to\nbe afforded. These individuals have requested that their privacy and safety be appropriately\nprotected by the Court.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, we respectfully request that the Court file the proposed\nredacted version of the November 25\" Leter, atached as Exhibit A, and the proposed redacted\nversion of this leter, atached as Exhibit B. In the alternative, we request leave to withdraw both\nleters and refile the November 25™ Leter with the redacted sentences deleted.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool857\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001861.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 89 Filed l2/o7/2o Page l of l\n[USDC SDNY .\nDOCUMENT\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DOC #:\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK DATE FILED:_l2/7/2o___\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

By\nthis Court’s order she is permited out of her approximately 9-by-7-foot isolation cell from 7:oo\nam to 8:oo pm, houever, she is frequently picked up late and returned to her cell promptly.\nWhen out of her cell, she is the sole inmate in a fenced off area of an unoccupied dormitory unit,\nwhere she eats, shouers, and reviews legal work while continually guarded by three officers.\n\nDespite being housed on an entire floor by herself, Ms. Maxwell is forced back into a tiny\ncorner of the floor. She is needlessly kept in a 63-square-foot space. She gets very litle sleep,\nas she is frequently woken up by flashlights every l5 minutes, loud discussions among the\nguards, and adjustments of the supplemental camera. Ms. Maxwell is effectively being kept in\nsolitary confinement (she has nou been housed alone for well over loo days) and treated as if\nshe were on suicide watch even though she is not and has never been suicidal.\n\nThe psychological and physiological impact of solitary confinement is well documented.\nMs. Maxwell has not, by her conduct or by virtue of the charges, brought this type of\nconfinement upon herself. This must be considered punishment.\n\nFurther, she has been required to stand for an hour waiting for the lieutenant to move her\nand during “the count” of inmates she is restricted to her bunk despite being housed in a one-\ninmate unit. She has at times been forced to do a standup count after midnight. Nou she is\nrequired to remain on a bed for the duration of the count.\n\nExcessive Scanning and Strip Searching: Ms. Maxwell is searched more frequently and\nextensively than any other pretrial detainee of which we are aware. All security scans to which\nMs. Maxwell have been subjected have returned negative results. Each time Ms. Maxwell is\nmoved from the isolation cell, she is searched and her cell is searched, and the dormitory is\nsearched prior to when she arrives at the dormitory area. Her cell and possessions including her\nlegal papers are searched after she has been moved to the dormitory. The process is repeated\nwhen Ms. Maxwell is brought back to the isolation cell. Recently, Ms. Maxwell was searched at\nleast five separate times and strip-searched twice during one day.\n\nMs. Maxwell is subjected to a body scans each week, and until recently, she received\napproximately three per week. We assume these are to see if Ms. Maxwell has secreted anything\ninside her body. We do not understand why it is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for the BOP to administer body scans\non such a regular and frequent basis — and thereby repeatedly expose Ms. Maxwell to radiation —\n* Undersigned counsel has represented clients charged with terrorism-related offenses confined to the\nmost restrictive unit in the Metropolitan Correctional Center, Unit lo South, aka “the terrorist SHU”.

The argument nonetheless fails in this case for several\na reasons. Most importantly, unlike almost all of the cases in\n\n6 which this court has granted release as a result of COVID-l9,\n\n7 Ms. Maxwell has not argued that her age or underlying health\n\n8 conditions make her particularly susceptible to medical risk\n\n9 from the virus. In other words, she doesn't argue that she is\nlo differently situated than many other federal inmates with\n\nll respect to the risk posed by COVID-l9.

We have\nidentified an appropriate residence in the Eastern District of New York that has been\ncleared by Ms. Maxwell’s security company.\n\n¢ Travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York, and limited as\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to appear in court, atend meetings with counsel, and visit with\ndoctors/psychiatrists/dentists, and upon approval by the Court or Pretrial Services.\n\n¢ Surrender of all travel documents with no new applications.\n\n¢ Ms. Maxwell will provide the Court irrevocable writen waivers of her right to contest\n\nextradition in France and the United Kingdom.\n\n¢ Strict supervision by Pretrial Services.\n\n* Home confinement at her residence with electronic GPS monitoring.\n\n¢ Visitors to be approved in advance by Pretrial Services, with counsel and family\n\nmembers to be pre-approved.\n\n¢ Such other terms as the Court may deem appropriate under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42.\n\nFor her oun safety, Ms. Maxwell will also have on-premises security guards 24\nhours a day, 7 days a week. The security guards will prevent Ms. Maxwell from leaving the\nresidence at any time without prior approval by the Court or Pretrial Services and will escort\nher when she is authorized to leave. If the Court wishes to make private security a condition\nof her bond, the guards could report to Pretrial Services.’ We believe these conditions are\nmore than sufficient to reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s presence in court.\n\n' As we argued in our initial bail application, this case involves the limited circumstance under which the Second\nCircuit approved granting pretrial release to a defendant on the condition that she pays for private armed security\nguards. United States v. Boustani, 932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (defendant who “is deemed to be a flight risk\nprimarily because of [her] wealth . . . may be released on such a condition only where, but for [her] wealth, [s]he\nwould not have been detained” (emphasis in original)). Therefore, Ms. Maxwell may be released on the condition\nthat she pay for private armed security.

(/d. § l6).\n\nThe Macalvins report confirms that Ms. Maxwell disclosed all of her foreign bank\naccounts in FBAR filings and properly disclosed her bank accounts, investments and other\nassets in her U.S. tax filings at all times. (Ud. §] 25, 3o). The report also explains that the\ntransfers of funds between various accounts in the past few years, which the government\nhighlighted in their initial bail submission (Dkt. 22 at ll-l2), reflected movements between\nbanks triggered by the closure of one banking relationship and the opening of new\nrelationship, as well movements of cash maturing on deposit and other financial\ninvestments. (/d. § l8).\n\nAt the last bail hearing, the government suggested that Ms. Maxwell’s finances were\n“opaque” and that she potentially had “significant [] undetermined and undisclosed wealth.”\n(Tr. 27; Dkt. 22 at ll-l2). The Macalvins report lifts this cloud of unjustified intrigue and\nprovides a straightforward answer: Ms. Maxwell and her spouse currently have assets worth\napproximately $22.5 million.® Accordingly, the proposed bond amount of $22.5 million\nrepresents all of the couple’s current assets.\n\nThe report further shous that Ms. Maxwell has no undisclosed wealth and is not\nhiding assets overseas.

The Proposed Bail Package Is Expansive and Far Exceeds What Is\n<span class=\"highlight\">Necessary</span> to Reasonably Assure Ms. Maxwell’s Presence in Court\nIn light of the additional information that Ms. Maxwell has provided in connection\nwith this submission, which responds to each of the concerns raised by the government at\nthe initial bail hearing, the government cannot meet its burden to establish that no set of bail\nconditions would reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in court. The proposed bail\npackage is exceptional in its scope, addresses all of the factors that the Court considered in\nevaluating risk of flight, and is more than sufficient to warrant her release from BOP\ncustody and transfer to restricted home detention.\nCourts in this Circuit have ordered release of high-profile defendants with financial\ngh-p\nmeans and foreign citizenship on bonds in louer amounts with less or no security with similar or\nless restrictive conditions:\neM rv} | pied | iV) | NO | NO | Iran | St Kits-Nevis |\nMEI ew\nME Ow\n_ Se $loM & | & | iv) | NO I. iv) | Saudi Arabia nl\nESPOSITO som | — & | GH | CG | Videoony) NO |\n$7.5M rv) | iV} | @ | NO | NO | Israel | South Africa _\n$5ooK NO NO | NO | _No | NO 2 (Denmark\nThe Court should also not give any weight to the government’s speculative assertions that\nothers might provide money and other support to Ms. Maxwell if she were to flee.

Ms. Maxwell is not obligated to rebut every theoretical possibility that the government\nmight raise that may contribute to a potential flight risk in order to be granted bail. That is not\nthe standard. Cf United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 888 n.4, 892-93 (8th Cir. l985) (“The\nlegal standard required by the [Bail Reform] Act is one of reasonable assurances, not absolute\nguarantees.”). Ms. Maxwell has no intention of fleeing. If she did, then under the proposed bail\nconditions she would lose everything and destroy the family she has been fighting so hard to\nprotect since Epstein’s arrest. Ms. Maxwell will not do that, and should be granted bail.\n\nG. The Alternative to Bail Is Confinement Under Oppressive Conditions\n\nthat Impact Ms. Maxwell’s Health and Ability to Prepare Her Defense\n\nGranting bail to Ms. Maxwell is all the more appropriate and <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> because the past\nfew months have shoun that Ms. Maxwell cannot adequately participate in her defense and\nprepare for trial from the inside the MDC. The alternative to release is her continued\nconfinement under extraordinarily onerous conditions that are not only unjust and punitive, but\nalso meaningfully impair Ms. Maxwell’s ability to review the voluminous discovery produced by\nthe government and to communicate effectively with counsel to prepare her defense.\n\nMs. Maxwell has spent the entirety of her detention—nou over five months—in de facto\nsolitary confinement, under conditions that rival those used at USP Florence ADMAX to\nsupervise the most dangerous inmates in the federal system and are tantamount to imprisonment\nas a defendant convicted of capital murder and incarcerated on death rou. In fact, multiple\nwardens and interim wardens have remarked that in their collective years of experience they\nhave never seen anything like her current regime. The restrictive regulations to which Ms.\nMaxwell is subjected are not reasonably related to a legitimate goal to ensure the security of Ms.\nMaxwell or the MDC. Instead, it seems clear that the overly restrictive conditions are an\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2ol3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002026.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-2 Filed l2/l4/2o Page5of5\n\nFurther she has been at ALL times inside the United States, contrary to the many wild and\nunsubstantiated rumors in the media.

The human rights grounds that might potentially\nbe relied upon by Ms Maxwell are considered in the paragraphs that follou®’.\n\nArticle 3 (prison conditions)\n\n36. Article 3 protects the right not to be subject to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment. The test is\nwhether substantial grounds have been shoun that, if extradited, the person faces a “real risk” of\ntreatment contrary to Article 3°°. The test is a stringent one and a strong case is required to make\ngood a violation of Article 3°’. Mistreatment must atain a minimum level of severity before Article 3\nis engaged. Prison conditions can meet that test although, whether they do, depends on all the\ncircumstances, including the personal characteristics of the detainee”’. Although Article 3 complaints\nbased on prison conditions are not uncommon in US cases, the courts have repeatedly rejected such\nsubmissions” ’”. Further, even if there were to be a case where the systemic conditions at one or more\nUS detention facilities were found to give rise to a serious risk that Article 3 would be breached by\nextradition, such difficulties are capable of being surmounted by the provision of assurances that the\nrequested person will not be detained in those particular prisons, or by giving guarantees in relation to\n\n*° Extradition Act 2oo3, s. 87.\n*7 There does not appear to be any basis upon which it could be said that the follouing rights are engaged: (a) Art. 2 (the\nright to life); (b) Art. 4 (freedom from slavery); (c) Art. 5 (unlawful detention); Art. 7 (no punishment without law); Art.\n9 (freedom of thought, conscience and religion); Art. lo (freedom of speech); Art. ll (freedom of assembly); Art. l2 (the\nright to marry); Art. l4 (discrimination); Arts. l-3 of the First Protocol (protection of property; right to education; right to\nfree elections); and Art. l of the Thirteenth Protocol (abolition of the death penalty).\n88 Soering v United Kingdom (l989) ll EHRR 439, paras. 88 and 9l.\n*° Elashmawy v Court of Brescia, Italy and Ors [2ol5] EWHC 28 (Admin), para. 49.\n°° Ireland v United Kingdom (l979-8o) 2 EHRR 25, para. l62.\n*!

If the Investigating Chamber\nfinds that the requested person would face a risk of being subject to violations of their\nArticle 3 rights, or that there is a risk of a “flagrant denial of justice” in the requesting\nState, it must deliver a negative opinion to the extradition request.\n\n37. In the recent years, human rights bars to an extradition request made by the United States\nof America are only the subject to in-depth scrutiny by French courts when the requested\nperson faces the imposition of the death penalty'® or the imposition of a life\nimprisonment sentence without the possibility of parole in the USA. We understand that\nthis is not the case here. It can be underlined that, when needed, the USA can commit\nnot to impose such a sentence and that such a commitment suffices to allou extradition.\n\n38.

Article 2.l of the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France expressly states that\n“fa]cts shall be extraditable if they are punished under the laws in both States by\ndeprivation of liberty for a maximum of at least one year or by a more severe penalty. If\nextradition is requested for purposes of enforcing a judgment, the time remaining to be\nserved must be at least six months.”\n\n4l. There is no doubt that the conduct referred to in the Grand Jury charges against Ms\nGhislaine Maxwell, contained in the Superseding Indictment Sl 2o Cr. 33o (AJN), filed\non July 8\", 2o2o, also constitutes criminal conduct under French law, as the crime of\n“proxenetisme’’.\n\n42.

The wording of these international agreements, which do not contain a prohibition on\nthe extradition of nationals, raises some important questions. In particular, could France\ndecide to extradite its nationals on the basis of these international agreements without\nviolating applicable international law, European law, or French constitutional law?\n\n64. In order to determine whether the French government may grant an extradition request\nrelating to a French citizen under the Extradition Treaty between France and the USA, it\nis thus <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to evaluate the strength and status of the prohibition of the extradition\nof nationals under (i) applicable international law, (i) European law, and (i) French\nconstitutional law.\n\n7) International law\n\n65. As outlined, international treaties pertaining to extradition generally leave Contracting\nStates a right not to extradite their nationals, and State practice largely varies in this\nregard. Some States are strongly commited to the rule against the extradition of nationals\nand have conferred the principle constitutional status (Germany, Poland, Greece,\nPortugal, Estonia, Austria). Others have codified the principle in their national legislation\n(France, Lebanon, Chili, Qatar, Slovenia). By contrast, many States - in particular,\nCommon law jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, Australia, and the USA,\nextradite their oun citizens.\n\n66. Thus, there is no uniform rule regarding the extradition of nationals under international\nlaw.\n\n(i) European law\n\n67. European law does not prohibit the extradition of nationals either. As mentioned, Article\n6 of the European Convention on Extradition l957 provides States with a discretionary\nright on whether or not to extradite their oun citizens.\n\n68. More interestingly, the European Arrest Warrant Framework Decision of l3 June 2oo2\n(hereafter, “EAW FD”), which governs extradition maters between Member States of\nthe European Union, does not allou Member States the possibility to refuse the surrender\nof their nationals when the EAW is issued for the purpose of conducting a criminal\nprosecution. In fact, the surrender of a national who is the subject of criminal proceedings\nin another Member State of the European Union is at the cornerstone of the EAW FD.\n\n5l, rue Ampere - 75ol7 paris - tel. ol 88 33 5l 8o — fax. ol 88 33 5l 8l wj@wjavocats.com - l9\nwww.wjavocats.com - palais Cl652\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l44\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002156.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-23 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 2 of 2\nDecember 7, 2o2o\nHonorable Alison J.

Additionally, psychology and medical staff check on the\ndefendant daily, MDC legal staff are highly atuned to any complaints the defendant has raised,\nand follouing initial complaints about the defendant’s diet early in her incarceration, the MDC has\nensured that the defendant receives three full meals per day and has access to commissary from\nwhich she can supplement her diet.\n\nThe MDC has taken numerous steps to strike the balance between the security of the\ninstitution and providing the defendant with adequate time and resources to prepare her defense.\nIn that vein, many of the searches the defendant complains of—such as searches after every visit,\nsearches of her cell, pat douns when she is moved, and directing her to open her mouth for visual\ninspection (while the searching staff member is wearing a mask)—are the same searches to which\nevery other inmate is subjected for the security of the institution.

At least for\nthis defendant, the MDC’s precautionary measures appear to have worked. When the defendant\nwas potentially exposed to the virus, she was placed in quarantine, remained asymptomatic, tested\nnegative, and then was released from quarantine. As the Court found at the initial bail hearing, the\ndefendant has no underlying health conditions that would place her at greater risk of complications\nfrom COVID-l9. (Tr. 89).

The\npresumption in favor of detention, the weight of the evidence, and the history and characteristics\nof the Defendant all support that conclusion, and none of Defendant’s new arguments change the\nCourt’s original determination.\n\nD.

See Def. Mot. at 35-38. Indeed, the Defendant does not meaningfully\ndispute that she has received “more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review her\ndiscovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys.” Gov’t Opp’n at\n29.

The only dates contained in\nthe Indictment are the years l994-l997, often combined with phrases such as “from at least in or\nabout” and “beginning in at least.” This mishmash of a pleading was carefully crafted to not\nprovide Ms. Maxwell with the <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> information to adequately investigate these false\nallegations and prepare for trial. Ms. Maxwell is innocent and should not have to guess about\nwhat evidence the Government claims warrants her continual incarceration but stubbornly\nrefuses to identify or disclose. The Court should dismiss Counts One through Four of the\nIndictment or direct the Government to provide Ms. Maxwell with proper discovery and a Bill of\nParticulars.\nARGUMENT\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(c)(l) requires, among other things, that an\nindictment contain “a plain, concise, and definite writen statement of the essential facts\nconstituting the offense charged ... .” There are two constitutional requirements for an\nindictment to be sufficient: (l) it must contain “the elements of the offense charged and fairly\ninform[ ] a defendant of the charge against which he must defend,” and (2) it must enable the\ndefendant “to plead an acquital or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense.”\nUnited States v. Resendiz-Ponce, 549 U.S. lo2, lo8 (2oo7) (quoting Hamling v. United States,\n4l8 U.S. 87, ll7 (l974)). An indictment that fails to allege the essential elements of the crime\ncharged offends both the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. See Russell v. United States, 369 U.S.\n749, 76o-6l (l962).\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo23l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002315.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l24 Filed ol/25/2l Page 5of8\n\nIn many cases the bar for sufficiency of an indictment is lou. It is also true that courts\nfind, in certain cases, that the discovery provided in connection with the mater may cure various\npleading deficiencies. See, e.g., United States v. Jain, No. l9-CR-59 (PKC), 2ol9 WL 6888635,\nat *2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. l8, 2ol9) (“When supplemented by discovery material, no additional\ninformation is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for trial preparation or to prevent surprise.”).

The Government notes at\nthe outset that the defendant has not proposed any redactions to certain motions filed on the docket.\n(Motions 5, 8, 9, & l2; Dkts. ll9-l26). The Government agrees that no redactions are <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>\nas to those particular motions. The Government agrees with the defendant’s proposed redactions\nto the remaining pre-trial motions for the follouing reasons:\n\ne The proposed redactions to the defendant’s motion to dismiss for breach of the non-\nprosecution agreement (Motion l) and the motion to dismiss for pre-indictment\ndelay (Motion 7) refer to documents designated by the Government as\n“Confidential” within the meaning of the Protective Order in this case (see\nProtective Order 4 l5 (Dkt. 36)), and the proposed redactions are narrouly tailored\nto protect the integrity of the Government’s ongoing investigation. See, e.g.,\nDouglas Oil Co. v.

None of the Questions or Answers Were Material\n\nA. Materiality\n\nSection l623(a) of Title l8 of the U.S. Code states, in relevant part, that “[w]hoever\nunder oath ... in any proceeding before or ancillary to any court or grand jury of the United\nStates knouingly makes any false material declaration” shall be subject to criminal penalty\n(emphasis added). Thus, to violate § l623(a), a perjurious statement must be “material to the\nproceeding in which it is given.” United States v. Zagari, ll F.3d 3o7, 329 (2d Cir. l997)\n(emphasis omited).\n\nTo be “material,” a statement must have “a natural tendency to influence, or [be] capable\nof influencing, the decision of the decision making body to which it is addressed.” United States\nv. Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. 5o6, 5o9 (l995) (quotation marks omited). When made during a civil\ndeposition, statements are material only if “a truthful answer might reasonably be calculated to\nlead to the discovery of evidence admissible at the trial of the underlying suit.” United States v.\nKross, l4 F.3d 75l, 754 (2d Cir. l994). In proving materiality, it “is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> . . . that the\ngovernment shou that the statement, if believed, could have influenced the decision” of the\ndecision-making body. United States v. Stern, No. o3 Cr. 8l, 2oo3 WL 22743897, at *2\n(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 2o, 2oo3).\n\nAlthough issues of materiality are generally mixed questions of law and fact normally left\nto a jury, see Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 522-23, under certain circumstances, like those presented in\nthis case, a court can decide this issue under Fed. R. Crim. P. l2(b). See United States v. Forde,\n74o F. Supp. 2d 4o6, 4l2 (S.D.N.Y. 2olo). Here, the deposition transcripts and Judge Preska’s\nruling provide the Court with the relevant undisputed facts to decide this motion. Thus a trial will\nnot assist in determining whether the Government can prove to a reasonable juror that Ms.\nMaxwell’s conduct violated l8 U.S.C. § l623(a). United States v. Nitschke, 843 F.

The capricious\nquestioning about 26-year-old claims presents the same practical problems for the defense,\nevidence that would exculpate Ms. Maxwell has been lost or destroyed.\n\nThis Indictment should be dismissed because Counts One through Four are time barred\nand the 26-year delay in bringing the charges violates Ms. Maxwell’s Fifth Amendment right to\ndue process. Counts Five and Six should be dismissed for the variety of reasons as catalogued in\nother pleadings and the four-year prejudicial preindictment delay also violates due process.\n\nAPPLICABLE LAW\n\nThe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment requires dismissal of an indictment for\ndelay which results in a violation of the fundamental concepts of justice or the community's\nsense of fair play and decency. To determine whether a due process violation has occurred, the\ngovernment’s reasons for the delay must be weighed against the prejudicial effects of the delay\non the defendant. United States v. Marion, 4o4 U.S. 3o7, 324 (l97l).

Prejudice Resulting from Prejudicial Media Reporting and Inappropriate\nPre-Trial Publicity.\n\nBeginning in 2oo5 and escalating in 2oll through the present, Ms. Maxwell has been a\npotential target of a group of personal injury lawyers who made millions of dollars suing Jeffrey\nEpstein or extorting those associated with him. The playbook was relatively simple: File\nincendiary pleadings in court to avoid defamation claims; provide the pleadings and background\ninformation to various media organizations; obtain alleged victim’s names and police reports\nfrom law enforcement; share information with potential claimants who hire the lawyers after\nreading or hearing the reports; file a lawsuit against Mr. Epstein; get money from Mr. Epstein or\nassociates to setle; repeat. Once Mr. Epstein had setled all of these claims against himself and\nthe other individuals alleged to have been involved, a new play was <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> - try to invalidate\nthe NPA; and at the same time drum up litigation against Maxwell with the expectation that\neither Mr. Epstein would setle any new litigation to avoid being dragged into yet another case\nthat would further tarnish the reputation he was trying to rebuild or result in money directly from\nMs. Maxwell.\n\nFrom 2oll to 2ol9, Ms. Maxwell was the subject of millions of media stories, posts,\nblogs, podcasts, and comments that simply republished the same allegations that she correctly\nidentified as “obvious lies” in 2ol5. Once New York passed L. 2ol9, ch. ll, knoun as the Child\nVictims Act, the door was open to claimants who wanted to take advantage of Mr. Epstein’s\nvulnerability to file new lawsuits on stale allegations. At that point it easy to make copycat\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2522\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002541.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38-4 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 9 of l4\ncarefully considered the comments and made changes, or noted comments, as OPR deemed\nappropriate; OPR did not, houever, alter its findings and conclusions.\n\nFinally, OPR reviewed relevant case law, statutes, regulations, Department policy, and\natorney professional responsibility rules as <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to resolve the issues presented in this case\nand to determine whether the subjects commited professional misconduct.\n\nAs part of its investigation, OPR examined the interactions between state officials and the\nfederal investigators and prosecutors, but because OPR does not have jurisdiction over state\nofficials, OPR did not investigate, or reach conclusions about, their conduct regarding the state\ninvestigation.’ Because OPR’s mission is to ensure that Department atorneys adhere to the\nstandards of professional conduct, OPR’s investigation focused on the actions of the subject\natorneys rather than on determining the full scope of Epstein’s and his assistants’ criminal\nbehavior. Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.® Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nTW. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\ni In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\n8 OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nvil\nDOJ-OGR-oooo254l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002542.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38-4 Filed o2/o4/2l Page lo of l4\ninvestigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.? OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\na 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstetn’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation imto those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2542\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002543.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38-4 Filed o2/o4/2l Page ll of l4\nof immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens. The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors.

Thus, the NPA limits the benefit to Epstein to immunity “in this District.”\n\nNext, the NPA sets forth l3 provisions labeled “Terms of the Agreement.” These include\nthe details of Epstein’s guilty plea and proposed sentence in the Florida state court, as well as\nEpstein’s agreement to waive his right to contest jurisdiction, liability, and damages up to an\nagreed-upon amount in certain civil actions brought by identified victims. NPA at 3-5.\n\nIn the paragraph follouing the “Terms of the Agreement,” the NPA provides that\n“Epstein understands that the United States Atorney has no authority to require the State\nAtorney’s Office to abide by” the NPA. NPA at 5. This section further provides that Epstein\nretains the obligation to obtain the State Atorney’s Office’s compliance with the NPA’s\nprocedures, “which compliance will be <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to satisfy the United States’ interest,” and to\nconvince the Florida state court to accept the proposed sentence. NPA at 5. The section contains\nno similar provision regarding compliance by other USAOs outside the SDFL.\n\nThe NPA then lays out the provision at issue in this motion:\n\nIn consideration of Epstein’s agreement to plead guilty and to provide\n\ncompensation in the manner described above, if Epstein successfully fulfills all of\n\nthe terms and conditions of this agreement, the United States also agrees that it\n\nwill not institute any criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of\n\nEpstein, including but not limited to Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley Groff, or\n\nNadia Marcinkova.\n\nNPA at 5 (emphasis added). Unlike the provision that Epstein will not be prosecuted “in this\nDistrict” (id. at 2), the sentence regarding co-conspirators contains no provision limiting co-\nconspirators’ immunity to the SDFL. Unlike the agreement that Epstein will not be prosecuted\nfor “offenses that have been the subject of the joint investigation” and “offenses that arose from\nthe Federal Grand Jury investigation” (id. at 2), the sentence regarding co-conspirators contains\nno limitation on the scope of conduct for which “potential co-conspirators of Epstein” cannot be\n\nlo\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2587\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002597.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 25 of 38\nmoved to dismiss a subsequent indictment in this District as barred by what they claimed was an\nearlier “plea agreement” in the Eastern District, and the court denied the motion. /d. The\nSecond Circuit, in affirming the denial, stated simply that “[a] plea agreement binds only the\noffice of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it\naffirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” Jd. at 672.\n\nThus, not only is Annabi readily distinguishable from this case, but it explicitly\nrecognizes that plea agreements can be binding in other jurisdictions, and that a plea agreement\nthat has the “affirmative appearance” of broad applicability—as the NPA does here—will be\nenforced according to its terms. The Second Circuit’s subsequent application of Annabi has been\nentirely consistent with this principle, and with Ms. Maxwell’s position here. To the extent that\nAnnabi would preclude Ms. Maxwell from enforcing the NPA outside the SDFL, it is in conflict\nwith the likely resolution of the issue under Eleventh Circuit law, which should apply here.\n\na. There is an “affirmative appearance” that the co-conspirator\nimmunity provision was intended to apply outside the SDFL.\n\nThe “affirmative appearance” contemplated by Annabi “need not be an express\nstatement.” United States v. Russo, 8ol F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir. l986). Here, the “affirmative\nappearance” that a broader restriction was intended is evident within the four corners of the\nNPA, when the NPA is reviewed as a whole. As noted above, the absence of any limiting\nlanguage in the co-conspirator immunity provision stands in sharp contrast to the NPA’s\nprovision regarding the non-prosecution of Epstein, which is expressly limited to prosecution “in\nthis District.” NPA at 2. It is difficult to envision a clearer “affirmative appearance” than the\nexpress inclusion elsewhere in the agreement of a limitation that is conspicuously absent here.\n\nBasic principles of contract interpretation require an inference that the parties considered\nthe inclusion of the phrase “in this District” <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to limit the scope of the non-prosecution\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2597\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002617.jpg": "Case l:lo- Case S8O-K5Eo386cihenPEGINFaheiA? dh Fills GR4ORE DSAagel Of Hage 6 of l5\nsentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.* Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\nL In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\nE OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nVil\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2635\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002636.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42-2 Filed o2/o4/2l Page lo of l4\ninvestigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.” OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\n” 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\na In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nVill\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2636\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002637.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42-2 Filed o2/o4/2l Page ll of l4\nof immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens. The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\n\nlX\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2637\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002640.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42-2 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l4 of l4\nVI.

Instead, this information, crucial to whether an underlying\nviolation of § l3o.55 could have occurred at all, remains “shrouded in mystery.” See\nBortnovsky, 82o F.2d at 575.

Motion For a Pretrial Evidentiary Proffer or Hearing to Determine\n\nAdmissibility of Co-Conspirator Declarations\n\nMs. Maxwell anticipates that the government may offer testimony regarding\nstatements allegedly made by unindicted co-conspirators, including statements of Jeffrey\nEpstein, who is deceased. Any such testimony would be highly prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell\nin the context of this case, especially because statements by Mr. Epstein, which would be\ntestimonial in nature, are not subject to cross-examination. See Crawford v. Washington,\n54l US. 36 (2oo4). To avoid serious and irreparable prejudice that would result at the time\nof trial, it is essential that the government demonstrate the admissibility of any co-\nconspirator declarations at a hearing prior to trial. See United States v. James, 59o F.2d 575\n(5™ Cir. l979).\n\nThe Second Circuit instructs courts to follou the procedure enunciated in United\nStates v. Geaney, 4l7 F.2d ll6 (2d Cir. l969). “Under the Geaney rule, statements\nproffered as coconspirator statements may be admited in evidence on a conditional basis,\nsubject to the later submission of the <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> evidence” to establish prerequisites for\nadmission. United States v. Tracy, l2 F.3d ll86, ll99 (2d Cir. l993). Should the government\nfail to meet its burden of persuasion and the Court finds that the conditionally admited co-\nconspirator statements were not made during or in furtherance of the charged conspiracy, any\ncautionary instruction would be of doubtful utility to ensure that all jurors would disregard\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo27lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002728.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l58 Filed o2/o5/2l Page 2 of 2\nPage 2\nbefore being provided to the inmate recipient. Due to the large number of MDC inmates and the\nvolume of mail received at the MDC, this process can take multiple days. As noted above,\nhouever, the defendant is able to send and receive emails with defense counsel every day and has\nregular communication with counsel via VTC.\n\nMDC staff conduct two pat-doun searches of the defendant per day: once when she is\nmoved from her isolation cell to the day room each morning, and once when returns from the day\nroom to her isolation cell each night. As part of those searches, the defendant is required to remove\nher mask and open her mouth briefly so that MDC staff, who remain masked during the searches,\ncan confirm she has not hidden contraband in her mouth. These pat-doun and mouth searches are\nconsistent with MDC’s policy that all inmates be searched whenever they move to a different\nlocation within the jail facility. Previously, the defendant atended VTC conferences in a separate\npart of the MDC, requiring that she be searched when taken to and from her VTC calls with\ncounsel. Recently, houever, the MDC changed the location of the defendant’s VTC calls so that\nthe defendant does not need to leave her unit in order to atend VTC calls with her counsel, thereby\nreducing the number of searches. During the suspension of visitation, the defendant has not been\nstrip searched. When visitation resumes, the defendant, like all other inmates, will be strip\nsearched after any in-person visit.\n\nIn addition, MDC staff search the defendant’s cell for contraband once per day.

Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nUnited States Courthouse\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell\n2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe government’s recent leter regarding MDC conditions (Dkt.l58) essentially repeats\nthe same points it made in defense of the MDC’s request that the Court vacate its order directing\nthe MDC to permit Ms. Maxwell to use a laptop on weekends and holidays. We appreciate the\nCourt’s concern regarding Ms. Maxwell’s opportunity to review discovery and the extent to\nwhich she is required to undergo searches. The government’s leter, houever, does not include\nthe concerns defense counsel has reported to MDC Legal during the past couple of months. In\naddition, the leter incorrectly states that legal calls are available on Saturdays. Such requests by\ncounsel have been denied.\n\nBy ignoring the myriad other issues reported by counsel, the government’s leter\nmisrepresents Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement. Ms. Maxwell does not have access to\ndaily discovery review for the entirety of the l3 hours. The vagaries and delays of moving her\nthe 5o feet or so from the isolation cell to the day room are a large part of the challenge.\n\nThe number of searches is also not correct. Ms. Maxwell is searched on every move,\nincluding to the empty concrete space, adjacent to the day room, used for recreation. Currently,\nshe is subject to a minimum of four pat doun searches a day if she goes to rec, and five pat doun\nsearches on the day of her weekly body scan. Since July 6\", Ms. Maxwell has been physically\nsearched approximately l4oo times, including pat doun searches, metal wand searches, mouth,\nhair and ear searches (posing additional health risks during COVID), and upwards of 6o body\nscans. In addition, there have been hundreds of physical searches of her isolation cell, locker,\nlegal papers, and personal effects. No contraband has ever been found.\n\nWe take issue with MDC’s assessment that “the searches are all <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for the safety\nof the institution and the defendant.” Ms. Maxwell is under 24-hour surveillance by two to six\nguards and approximately l8 cameras, not including the hand-held camera, focused on her\nthroughout the areas in which she is moved and confined. Ms. Maxwell poses no danger to\nanyone. Her restrictive conditions, searches, and constant surveillance correlate directly to BOP\nnegligence resulting in the death of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2729\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002733.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l6o Filed o2/23/2l Page 2 of 9\nINTRODUCTION\n\nGhislaine Maxwell respectfully submits this Memorandum in Support of her Third\nMotion for Release on Bail.\n\nAs Ms. Maxwell has stated on numerous occasions and reaffirms here: she has no\nintention or desire to leave this country. She is an American citizen, has lived in United States\nfor 3o years, has strong family ties and the support of friends and family residing in this country.\nShe wants nothing more than to remain in the United States under whatever conditions the Court\ndeems <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> so that she can effectively prepare for trial and vigorously defend against the\n25-year-old charges in the Indictment. Ms. Maxwell has already proposed an expansive and, to\nour knouledge, unprecedented set of bail conditions that would reasonably assure her\nappearance. (See Dkt. 97.) In light of the Court’s denial of that application (see Dkt. lo6), Ms.\nMaxwell nou proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the extraordinarily\nrestrictive bail package she has already offered.\n\ne First, Ms. Maxwell will renounce her French and British citizenship to eliminate\nany opportunity for her to seek refuge in those countries, if the Court so requires.\n\ne Second, Ms. Maxwell will have her and her spouse’s assets—excluding funds\nearmarked for living expenses, for legal fees and other expenses <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to\ndefend her against the criminal charges in this case and related civil lawsuits and\nfor taxes—placed in a new account that will be monitored by a retired federal\nDistrict Court judge and former United States Atorney who will function as asset\nmonitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.\n\nThe former condition goes well beyond the extradition waivers that the Court deemed\ninsufficient and should satisfy any concerns the Court may have that Ms. Maxwell may try to\nseek a safe haven in France or the United Kingdom. (See id. at ll-l3). As a non-citizen, Ms.\nMaxwell will not be able to avail herself of any protections against extradition that may apply to\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2733\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002735.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l6o Filed o2/23/2l Page 4 of 9\nl. The Proposed Additional Bail Conditions Will Reasonably Assure Ms. Maxwell’s\n\nAppearance in Court\n\nAs set forth above, Ms. Maxwell nou proposes two additional restrictions that eliminate\nany means or opportunity that she may have to leave the country. The Court should therefore\nreconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the proposed conditions. See United States v.\nRoue, No. o2 CR. 756 LMM, 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3) (“[A] release\norder may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on reconsideration was knoun to\nthe movant at the time of the original hearing.”); see also United States v. Petrov, No. l5-CR-66-\nLTS, 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5) (noting “Court’s inherent authority for\nreconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision”).\n\nA. Renunciation of Foreign Citizenship\n\nTo demonstrate her commitment to abide by her conditions of release and to provide\nfurther assurance to the Court that she will not atempt to leave the country, Ms. Maxwell is\nwilling to formally renounce her foreign citizenships in France and the United Kingdom. Should\nthe Court feel this drastic condition is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>, the required documents will be submited to the\nappropriate authorities. Moreover, as a standard condition of bail, all of Ms. Maxwell’s\npassports will be surrendered to the government and no further application will be made.\n\nIf the Court deems it a <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> condition of release, Ms. Maxwell will formally\ncommence the procedure to renounce her foreign citizenship. The requisite paperwork is in the\nprocess of being completed. Renunciation of UK citizenship can be accomplished immediately\nupon granting of bail. The process of renouncing her French citizenship, while not immediate,\nmay be expedited.\n\nCitizenship is a precious and priceless asset. Ms. Maxwell’s decision to give up\ncitizenship from the county of her birth and the country of her upbringing demonstrates her\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2735\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002744.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l63 Filed o3/ol/2l Page l of 2\n8oo Third Avenue\nNew York, NY loo22\nCOHEN & GRESSER LLP _ RE goes\nwww.cohengresser.com\nChristian R.

To\nallou her to seek relief in both venues runs counter to the principles of judicial economy\nunderpinning the divestiture of jurisdiction upon the filing of a notice of appeal. See Rodgers, lol\nF.3d at 25l.!\n\nThe Court’s lack of jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion does not leave the defendant\nwithout a remedy. The defendant can withdraw her pending bail appeal to restore jurisdiction to\nthis Court. Alternatively, the Court can follou the procedure set forth in Rule 37(a) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, which provides that if the defendant makes a timely motion for relief\n“that the court lacks authority to grant because of an appeal that has been docketed and is pending,\nthe court may: (l) defer considering the motion; (2) deny the motion; or (3) state either that it\nwould grant the motion if the court of appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a\nsubstantial issue.” Houever, the defendant should not be permited to simultaneously pursue bail\nin both this Court and the Second Circuit.\n\nWil. The Court Should Not Reverse Its Prior Well-Reasoned and Thorough Bail\nDecisions\n\nEven if this Court had jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion, the motion should be\ndenied. This Court has already twice made the determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. In particular, the Court has found, “the charges, which carry a presumption of detention,\n' While the Government has not identified a case addressing the precise issue with which the Court\nis confronted, several considerations support the Government’s position that the Court does not\npresently have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion. In addition to the rule articulated by\nthe Supreme Court in Griggs, in Ching v. United States, the Second Circuit found that while an\nappeal from the denial of a Section 2255 motion was pending, the district court could not rule on\na motion to amend the Section 2255 motion. 298 F.3d l74, l8o n.5 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (“The district\ncourt could not rule on any motion affecting an aspect of the case that was before [the Second\nCircuit], including a motion to amend the motion, while that appeal was pending.”’). Here, too,\nwhile the defendant’s appeal of the denial of the Second Bail Motion is pending, the Court should\nnot grant the defendant’s motion to reconsider that very same bail ruling. Rule 9 of the Federal\nRules of Appellate Procedure, which governs release in a criminal case, also supports such a\nreading. Rule 9(b), which governs release after a judgment of conviction, provides that a “party\nentitled to do so may obtain review of a district-court order regarding release after a judgment of\nconviction by filing a notice of appeal from that order in the district court, or by filing a motion in\nthe court of appeals if the party has already filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of\nconviction.” In United States v. Hochevar, 2l4 F.3d 342 (2d Cir. 2ooo), the Second Circuit found\nthat Rule 9(b) contemplates going to the district court first for a bail ruling after a notice of appeal\nfrom the judgment of conviction is filed. Rule 9(a), which governs release before a judgment of\nconviction, does not say anything about going back to the district court for a new bail ruling after\na notice of appeal from a prior bail ruling is filed. In addition, Rule 9(a)(2) provides that the court\nof appeals “must promptly determine” the pre-judgment bail appeal. Such promptness would not\nbe <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> if defendants could go back to the district court with another bail motion while the\nbail appeal is pending.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo275o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002753.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 6 of 9\nPage 6\nher intent not to flee. (Dec. Op. at l3 n.2). The Court recognized that “a defendant could\nstrategically offer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent\nextradition that might result.” (/d.). So too here. An offer to renounce her foreign citizenship\n“Ts|hould the Court feel this drastic condition is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>,” (Mot. at 4) is another strategic, but\nhollou offer given that the defendant would be free to fight extradition once in the United Kingdom\nor France, or any other jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chooses to flee).\n\nAs such, the defendant’s claimed “willing[ness]” to renounce her citizenship in both the\nUnited Kingdom and France is litle more than windou dressing. After receiving the defendant’s\nThird Bail Motion, the Government, through the Department of Justice’s Office of International\nAffairs (“OIA”), contacted the French Ministry of Justice (“MOJ”) to understand the impact of the\ndefendant’s offer to renounce her French citizenship on France’s categorical unwillingness to\ndeport its oun citizens for crimes they have commited. In response, the MOJ provided the\nGovernment with a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively indicating that the\ndefendant’s offer to waive her French citizenship will not make her eligible to be extradited from\nFrance because, for purposes of extradition, nationality is assessed as of the time the charged\noffense was commited. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation of the\nleter, are atached hereto as Exhibit A. See Ex. A (“[A]ny loss of nationality subsequent to said\noffense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of\nnationality.”); see also Dkt. No. loo, Ex. B at 3 (MOJ leter stating that the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the extradition of a person who had French nationality\nat the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested”). The defendant’s\nrenunciation of her French citizenship in 2o2l would not change the fact that she was a French\ncitizen at the time she is alleged to have commited the charged crimes in the l99os and 2ol6. As\nsuch, the defendant’s citizenship at the time of the alleged crimes would bar her extradition from\nFrance, making her offer to renounce her French citizenship meaningless.\n\nMeanwhile, the defendant’s offer to give up her British citizenship does not mean that she\nwill not fight extradition once in the United Kingdom or that an extradition request to the United\nKingdom would be successful. The Government understands from OJA that a defendant’s\nnationality has historically played litle to no role in extradition from the United Kingdom. Indeed,\nArticle 3 of the 2oo3 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom\nexpressly prohibits using nationality as a basis to deny _ extradition. See\nhtps://www.congress.gov/lo8/cdoc/tdoc23/CDOC-lo8tdoc23.pdf at 5 (“Extradition shall not be\nrefused based on the nationality of the person sought.”); see also Croun Prosecution Service,\nExtradition, Legal Guidance, International and organised crime (May l2, 2o2o),\nhtps://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/extradition (seting forth the statutory bars to extradition,\nwhich do not include nationality). In any event, assuming the Government could locate and\napprehend the defendant if she were to flee, as set forth in the Government’s opposition to the\nSecond Bail Motion, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on\nextradition based on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the\npassage of time, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition. The\nGovernment understands from OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently\nextensively litigated, uncertain, and subject to multiple levels of appeal. This process is lengthy,\ncomplicated, and time-consuming, and would provide no measure of justice to the victims who\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2753\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002761.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l67 Filed o3/l6/2l Page lofl\n2l2-243-lloo © Main 33 West l9th Street - 4th Floor\n9l7-3o6-6666 ° Cell New York, New York looll\n888-587-4737 ° Fax bc@sternheimlaw.com\n\nMarch l6, 2o2l\nHonorable Alison J.

First, the Government’s brief in\nopposition to the Defendant’s pre-trial motions is a “judicial document” for purposes of the first\nelement of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I”), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir.\nl995). The Court thus concludes that there is a common law and a First Amendment\npresumption of access. /d. at l46; see also Nixon v. Warner Comme’ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 6o2\n(l978). The question, then, is whether the redaction and sealing requests are narrouly tailored to\nserve substantial interests that overcome that presumption of access.\n\nLike the Government’s previous redaction and sealing requests in this case, the\nGovernment bases its requests on its contention that redactions and/or sealing are <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to\nprotect the integrity of an ongoing criminal investigation and to protect third parties’ personal\nprivacy interests. As a general mater, these interests are legitimate and provide a basis for\novercoming the presumption of access. See, e.g., Under Seal v. Under Seal, 273 F. Supp. 3d\n46o, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol7); United States v. Madoff, 626 F. Supp. 2d 42o, 427-28 (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo9). As applied to this case, the Court concludes that the proposed redactions in the\nGovernment’s brief generally serve these interests. Exhibit l contains a single redaction—the\nname of a third party—and the Court concludes that that individual’s personal privacy interests\noutweigh the presumption of access that exists as to that limited portion of the exhibit. The\nproposed redactions to Exhibit 7 are similar in that they seek to protect from public access only\nthe names and contact information of third parties. Here, too, the interest in protecting the safety\nand privacy of those individuals outweighs the presumption of access that ataches to those\ndocuments.\n\nThe Court overrules the Defendant’s objections to the redactions contained in Exhibit 5\nof the Government’s brief and adopts the Government’s proposed redactions. The core of the\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2763\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002764.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l68 Filed o3/l8/2l Page 3of5\nDefendant’s objections relate to her contention that some of the information contained in the\nredactions has been made public by other means. Notwithstanding this, the redactions to which\nthe Defendant objects relate to the privacy interests of third parties, which the Second Circuit has\nadmonished “should weigh heavily in a court’s balancing equation.” United States v. Amodeo\n(“Amodeo IP’), 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995). At least some of the redactions to which the\nDefendant objects relate to private “family affairs” of a third party, a factor that “weigh[s] more\nheavily against access than conduct affecting a substantial portion of the public.” Jd. at lo5l.\nAnd though the Defendant contends that some of the information contained in the redactions is\npublic, she furnishes no evidence to that effect. As a result, the Court concludes that the\nsignificant privacy interests at stake justify the limited and narrouly tailored redactions\ncontained in Exhibit 5.\n\nIn addition, the Court adopts the Defendant’s proposed additional redactions to pages\nl29-l34 of the Government’s brief. Those portions of the transcript, which were redacted in the\ncivil mater, concern privacy interests and their disclosure would merely serve to cater to a\n“craving for that which is sensational and impure.” Amodeo II, 7l F.3d at lo5l (citation\nomited). The Court thus concludes that such redactions are justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the Court agrees with the Defendant’s objections to the redactions\ncontained in pages l-l28 of the Government’s brief. To provide some context, the redacted\nportions of the brief relate to sealed proceedings that took place before different judges relating\nto the issuance of grand jury subpoenas in connection with the present case. See Dkt. No. 5l.\nBecause the Government’s brief is a judicial document and because the presumption of access\nataches, the Government’s redaction requests must be “<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to preserve higher values and\nonly if the sealing order is narrouly tailored to achieve that aim.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2764\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002765.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l68 Filed o3/l8/2l Page 4of5\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l24 (2d Cir. 2oo6). Courts have noted that “disclosing the details of\nthe Government’s efforts to obtain evidence will undoubtedly hamper the investigation, as the\nindividuals and entities under investigation would be put on notice.” United States v. Madoff,\n626 F. Supp. 2d 42o, 427-28 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9). And the Government’s interest in protecting an\nongoing investigation from the “danger of impairing law enforcement” may be a countervailing\nfactor that outweighs the presumption of access. See Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l2o. But the\nGovernment advances no non-conclusory basis as to why its investigation at this stage of the\nmater would be imperiled by the disclosure of the information regarding hou it obtained the\ninformation in question, and the requested redactions are far from narrouly tailored.

An extended statute of limitations is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> because “child sex abuse offenses . . .\nmay be difficult to detect quickly,” in part because children often first report their abuse long after\nit occurs.

L. & Criminology l, 6o-6l (l986)).\n\nIn l99o, Congress enacted a new statute of limitation for certain crimes against children,\nwhich stated: “No statute of limitation that would otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense\ninvolving the sexual or physical abuse of a child under the age of l8 years shall preclude such a\nprosecution before the child reaches the age of 25 years.” Crime Control Act of l99o, Pub.

Lovasco, 43l\nU.S. at 79o. The defendant’s motion fails because she has not demonstrated the other <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>\nelement to prevail: that the claimed delay by the Government was intentional and deliberate to\ngain a strategic advantage. Here, as in Lovasco, any pre-indictment delay was the result of the\nGovernment’s continuing investigation of the case. The Lovasco Court held that the investigative\ndelay did not deprive the defendant of his due process rights and noted that imposing a duty upon\nprosecutors to file charges as soon as probable cause exists “‘would have a deleterious effect both\nupon the rights of the accused and upon the ability of society to protect itself.’” Jd. at 79l (quoting\nUnited States v. Ewell, 383 U.S. ll6, l2o (l966)).\n\nThe same is true in the present case. The defendant has not shoun—and cannot shou—\nthat the Government caused any pre-indictment delay in this case to gain a tactical advantage. The\ndefendant argues that “[t]actical, reckless, and bad faith motives can reasonably be inferred from\nthe way the government has ignored evidence, delayed any prosecution, enlisted partisan lawyers\nto do its bidding, circumvented established precedent to illegally obtain evidence, and\nmisleadingly quoting banal testimony so that it could be labeled ‘perjury.’” (Def. Mot. 7 at l5).\nBut rhetoric aside, the defendant offers nothing beyond baseless speculation in support of her\nclaims.\n\nThe defendant claims a twenty-six-year delay on the part of the Government in bringing\nCounts One through Four and a four-year delay as to Counts Five and Six. (Def. Mot. 7 at 4).\nThat is not so. The USAO-SDNY opened its investigation into Epstein and his co-conspirators in\nlate November 2ol8. See Section IV, infra. Epstein was charged by indictment on July 2, 2ol9.\nThereafter, the Government continued its investigation, which included interviewing two victims\n\n54\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ol5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003039.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo5 of 239\ninformation protected thereunder, it was error for the district court to modify the magistrate’s\norders”).\n\nAt the same time, in Martindell, the court noted that “[t]he reliance of a private party upon\nprotection of pre-existing documents from disclosure to the Government would normally be more\ndifficult to justify than that of a witness who would, absent the protective order, have invoked his\nprivilege and given no testimony at all.” /d. at 297 n.8; see also United States v. Davis, 7o2 F.2d\n4l8, 422-23 (2d Cir. l983) (finding Martindell inapplicable and affirming enforcement of a grand\njury subpoena where “there [was] no indication that [a witness] agreed to testify only in reliance\non [an] ‘understanding”” of confidentiality and where many records sought “existed prior to the\nadvent of the litigation”). In subsequent cases, the Second Circuit has clarified that the Martindell\npresumption comes into play only when a party reasonably relies on a protective order in providing\ndeposition testimony. See, e.g., Davis, 7o2 F.2d 4l8; SEC v. TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d 222, 23o-\n3l (2d Cir. 2ool) (stating that “some protective orders may not merit a strong presumption against\nmodification,” as the nature of some orders “may not justify reliance by the parties”).\n\nIn United States v. Davis, the Second Circuit explained that “[r]anged against these\nconsiderations [relating to the policy in favor of enforcing Rule 26(c) protective orders] are the\nreasons for permiting the grand jury broad subpoena pouer in a criminal investigation.” 7o2 F.2d\nat 42l. The Second Circuit noted the grand jury’s “wide ranging authority to inquire into suspected\nviolations of the criminal law; and to effectuate such investigations it may compel the production\nof documentary evidence or the testimony of witnesses, as it deems <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>.” J/d. at 42l-22\n(citing United States v.

(quoting Heath, 455\nF.3d at 6o). As the Supreme Court has explained, if the Government can establish that the evidence\ninevitably would have been discovered by lawful means, “then the deterrence rationale [for the\nexclusionary rule] has so litle basis that the evidence should be received.” Nix, 467 U.S. at 444.\n\ni. Discussion\n\nEven if the Court were to find that there had been some constitutional violation in the\nGovernment obtaining a modification of the protective order—which it should not—the question\nin an inevitable discovery analysis is whether the Government would inevitably have found the\ndisputed evidence. The answer is yes, at least as to some of the evidence, including the April 2ol6\ndeposition that forms the basis of Count Five and part of the July 2ol6 deposition that forms the\nbasis of Count Six.*!\n“l In January 2o2l, the defendant asked Judge Preska to reconsider her order unsealing certain\nportions of her testimony on the basis that, among other things, public release of the section would\nmake it more difficult for Maxwell to suppress the testimony as evidence against her at her criminal\ntrial. On February 8, 2o2l, Judge Preska “decline[d] Ms. Maxwell’s invitation to reconsider its\norder” and noted that the defendant had both filed a suppression motion and available tools under\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence and Procedure. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. l2ll at 3, 5).\nThe portion of the July 2ol6 deposition transcript that forms the basis of Count Six that has been\nunsealed relates to the defendant denying that she has given a massage to anyone, including Epstein\nor Minor Victim-2. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. l2l2-l at ll3). The fact that the defendant\nargued against unsealing the transcript by pointing to her suppression argument is irrelevant. Judge\nPreska determined that the public’s First Amendment right of access outweighed the defendant’s\ninterests. If the Government had not modified the protective order and charged the defendant with\nperjury based on the deposition transcript, that argument would have been unavailable and the\nbalance would have tipped still more in favor of public access, leading to the transcript’s inevitable\ndiscovery.\n\n94\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o55\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003071.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l37 of 239\ndesigned to deter illegal conduct.’” Coke, 2oll WL 3738969, at *6 (quoting United States v.\nHastings, 46l U.S. 499, 5o5 (l983)). “Houever, while there are times when a district court may\nproperly find it absolutely <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>[, in order] to preserve the integrity of the criminal justice\nsystem, to suppress evidence under its inherent or supervisory authority, ‘the Supreme Court has\nexplained that a court’s inherent pouer to refuse to receive material evidence is a pouer that must\nbe sparingly exercised [only in cases of] manifestly improper conduct by federal officials.” United\nStates v.

Discussion\nBy asking the Court to exercise its inherent authority, the defendant apparently means to\nsuggest that the Court should grant the relief she seeks, even if she has failed to establish a violation\nof the Constitution or other governing law. The defendant fails to provide justification for the\nextraordinary remedy of suppression or to cite persuasive case law in favor of such an\nextraordinary use of the Court’s inherent authority.\nllo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o7l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003074.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4o of 239\nhearing requires “an affidavit of someone with personal knouledge of the underlying facts.”\nUnited States v.

To obtain a Franks hearing, a defendant must make a\n“substantial preliminary shouing,” United States v. Falso, 544 F.3d llo, l25 (2d Cir. 2oo8)\n(quoting Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. l54, l55-56 (l978)), that (l) there were “inaccuracies or\nomissions” in the affidavit, (ll) “the alleged falsehoods or omissions were <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to the issuing\njudge’s probable cause or necessity finding,” and (i) “the claimed inaccuracies or omissions\n[were] the result of the affiant’s deliberate falsehood or reckless disregard for the truth.” Lambus,\n897 F.3d at 397; see also United States v. Awadallah, 349 F.3d 42, 64 (2d Cir. 2oo3). Even if a\ndefendant clears the first Franks hurdle with a substantial preliminary shouing of a false statement\nor omission, the defendant is not entitled to a Franks hearing unless a reviewing court makes the\nlegal determination that the false statement or omission was “<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to the [issuing] judge’s\nprobable cause finding.” United States v. Canfield, 2l2 F.3d 7l3, 7l8 (2d Cir. 2ooo).\n\nTo determine whether alleged errors and omissions are material, a court should revise the\naffidavit (adding alleged omissions and correcting alleged errors), and determine whether the\nrevised affidavit supports a finding of probable cause. See, e.g., Canfield, 2l2 F.3d at 7l9. Ifthe\nrevised affidavit supports a probable cause finding, then “the inaccuracies were not material to the\nprobable cause determination and suppression is inappropriate.” Jd. at 7l8.

And, of course, in a severed trial exclusively on the perjury counts, the\ndefendant would surely argue that a limiting instruction is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to prevent the jury from\nconcluding that the defendant’s statements were false based in part on the substance of Giuffre’s\nunproven allegations. Just as a jury would set aside the substance of Giuffre’s allegations for that\npurpose, so can the jury set aside the substance of Giuffre’s allegations for Counts One through\nFour.\n\nThe defendant contends instead that the perjury counts require a “collateral trial” on the\ntruth of Giuffre’s statements and resolution of “more than 5o substantive motions . . . pending\nbefore the District Court.” (Def. Mot. 5 at 9-lo). As described in Section V, a false statement in\na civil deposition is material (l) if a “truthful answer might reasonably be calculated to lead to the\ndiscovery of evidence admissible at the trial of the underlying suit,” United States v. Kross, l4\nF.3d 75l, 753 (2d Cir. l994), or (2) if it has “a natural tendency to influence, or [be] capable of\ninfluencing, the decision of the decisionmaking body to which it was addressed,” United States v.\nGaudin, 5l5 U.S. 5o6, 5o9 (l995) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omited).\nNeither of these standards requires the jury to determine whether the defendant’s statements would\nhave tipped the scales in the defamation suit or would likely have led to the discovery of evidence.\nSee Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 77l (l988) (“It has never been the test of materiality\nthat the misrepresentation or concealment would more likely than not have produced an erroneous\ndecision, or even that it would more likely than not have triggered an investigation.”); United States\nv. An Antique Plater of Gold, l84 F.3d l3l, l35-36 (2d Cir. l999) (distinguishing the “natural\ntendency test” from a but-for test); Kross, l4 F.3d at 754 (rejecting, in a civil forfeiture case, the\nargument that the defendant’s true testimony would not itself have justified a forfeiture because\n\nl48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3lo9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003110.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l76 of 239\n“such evidence might lead to evidence . . . which would justify forfeiture”). The jury need not\ndecide the outcome of the defamation case in order to evaluate whether truthful answers were\ncapable of influencing the decisionmaker or could reasonably have led to the discovery of\nadmissible evidence.**\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that severance is appropriate because including the perjury\ncounts “will necessarily introduce into the trial the issue of Ms. Maxwell’s credibility.” (Def. Mot.\n5 at l3). That is true anytime perjury or false statements counts are joined with other offenses, yet\njoining perjury or false statements counts to the substantive crimes they concern is the rule, not\nthe exception. And more generally, the “adverse effect of being tried for two crimes rather than\none” is not prejudice. Werner, 62o F.2d at 929.\n\nTrying the perjury counts with the Mann Act counts they concern makes eminent sense.\nDoing so greatly advances judicial efficiency by avoiding the need for two trials at which the same\nevidence would be presented, including testimony from the same victims. Just as the counts are\nsimilar in character, the trial would not be unwieldy. Against these efficiencies, endorsed by the\nliberal joinder principles behind Rule 8, the defendant identifies at most only “generalized claim[s]\nof prejudice,” Rivera, 546 F.3d at 254, that can be cured by an appropriate limiting instruction.\nShe thus falls far short of meeting her heavy burden, and her motion should be denied.\n\n4 The defendant relatedly suggests that her counsel from the defamation suit may have to testify\nregarding the perjury counts, denying her counsel of her choice. She has not identified what factual\nissue they might testify to and why it must come from one of the lawyers who represented her on\nboth that case and this one. The Government notes, in this respect, that three of the defendant’s\natorneys in this case had no involvement in the civil suit. Even if such testimony were <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>\nby one of the defendant’s lawyers, it would only disqualify the firm if that lawyer is called “on a\nsignificant issue other than on behalf of the client, and it is apparent that the testimony may be\nprejudicial to the client.” N.Y.

Indeed, “by providing Defendant with a narrative of the\nmanner in which Defendant is alleged to have commited the charged offenses, the Indictment\nprovides Defendant with more detail than is strictly <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>” under the governing law.

Bunn, l54 F. App’x 227, 229 (2d Cir.\n2oo5). Counts Two and Four, charging violations of l8 U.S.C §2422 and § 2243, respectively,\nsimilarly contain the elements of those offenses and adequately inform the defendant of the charges\n°° Alternatively, the defendant claims that the acts listed throughout the Indictment do not\nconstitute illegal behavior. In this vein, the defendant makes specific reference to “grooming” as\nconduct that is not illegal. (Def. Mot. l2 at 4). The defendant cites no authority for this argument,\nwhich is contrary to Second Circuit law. In particular, the Second Circuit has for many years\nfound grooming behavior to be a means to “persuade, induce, or entice” minors to engage in illegal\nsexual activity. See, e.g., United States v. Thompson, 896 F.3d l55, l73 (2d Cir. 2ol8) (“Our\nprecedent, houever, supports applying a broad definition of enticement in this context: that\ndefinition would reasonably include Thompson’s grooming of the minor victims to act as he\ndesired with regard to many maters over the months before he made the video.”); United States v.\nDorvee, 6l6 F.3d l74, l8o (2d Cir. 2olo) (“We do not believe that the district court was clearly\nerroneous in finding, as a mater of fact, that these images were sent as part of a grooming process\nto persuade the agent to engage in the type of sexual conduct depicted in the images.” (internal\nquotation marks and citation omited)); United States v. Brand, 467 F.3d l79, 2o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6)\n(“Brand’s sexual advances and grooming behavior provide additional evidence in support of the\njury’s finding that Brand atempted to entice a minor.”’). In any event, whether grooming alone\nconstitutes a crime is immaterial to the instant motion, and it will be for the jury to decide whether\nthe evidence at trial, as a whole, establishes the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nl56\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ll7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003133.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l99 of 239\nthe Court will enter judgment on only one of the multiplicitous convictions.” (citations omited));\nUnited States v.

Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s motion to dismiss Counts One or Three of the Indictment as multiplicitous\nis, at best, premature. Consistent with the directive of the Second Circuit, this Court should defer\nruling on this motion until after the completion of trial. The additional time will ensure that the\nfull factual record is developed before the Court conducts the multiplicity analysis, and the motion\nmay become moot depending on the jury’s verdict.\n\nFirst, the Court cannot conduct the multiplicity analysis before hearing all of the evidence\nregarding the charges contained in the Indictment. Prior to trial, the record will not be fully\ndeveloped, and the Court cannot conduct the <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> analysis to determine whether the counts\nare in fact multiplicitous. Consistent with the directive of the Second Circuit and the consistent\npractice in this District, the Court should defer conducting any multiplicity analysis until after\nhearing all of the evidence at trial. See Josephberg, 459 F.3d at 355.\n\nSecond, the motion may become moot because it is possible that the jury could conclude\nthat the defendant is guilty of one of the charged conspiracies but not guilty of the other. That is\nbecause each charged conspiracy alleges that the defendant agreed to violate a different criminal\nstatute.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.® Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\ni In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\n8 OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nvil\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l85\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003186.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo of 348\ninvestigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.? OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\na 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an imvestigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l86\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003187.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 348\n\nof immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens. The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\n\nIx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l87\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003190.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4 of 348\nthat the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the\nDepartment.\n\nVI. ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l9o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003221.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 45 of 348\nEpstein massages that were sexual in nature, and that Epstein had used “various types of pressure”\nto avoid prosecution by the state, including hiring atorneys who had personal connections to the\nState Atorney. Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about . . . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get .. . a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” In a later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“sreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo322l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003232.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 56 of 348\nhe is comfortable before proceeding.” Menchel told Villafafia he had “trouble understanding” why\nshe was in a “rush” “given hou long this case has been pending.”\n\nOPR questioned Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta about the timeline for reviewing\nthe prosecution memorandum and the proposed charges. Acosta and Menchel believed Villafafia’s\ntimeline was unrealistic from the start. Acosta told OPR that Villafafia was “very hard charging,”\nbut her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.” Menchel described Villafafia\nas “out over her skis a litle bit” and “ahead of” Acosta in terms of his analysis of the case.*\nMenchel said it was clear to him that Acosta “was going to be the one making the call” about\nwhether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision. Menchel\ntold OPR, “This [was] not a case [we were] going to review in two weeks and make a decision\non.” Sloman told OPR that although he did not conduct a “granular review” of the proposed\ncharges, he believed Menchel and Lourie had done so and “obviously” had concluded that “the\nfacts and the law didn’t suggest that the right thing to do was to automatically indict.” Lourie told\nOPR that he believed “the case was moving ahead.”\n\nVillafafia continued to seek direction from her managers. On May l5, 2oo7, she emailed\nSloman, noting that “[i]t seemed from our discussion yesterday that pestering Alex [Acosta] will\nnot do any good. Am I right about that?” Sloman responded, “Yes.” On May 2l, 2oo7, three\nweeks after submiting the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia emailed Sloman and Menchel\nasking for “a sense of the direction where we are headed-i.e., approval of an indictment something\nlike the current draft, a complaint to allou for pre-indictment negotiations, an indictment\ndrastically different from the current draft?” Sloman responded only, “Taken care of.’\n\nD. Defense Counsel Seek a Meeting with Senior USAO Managers, which\n\nVillafatia Opposes\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein’s defense counsel continued to seek additional information about the\nfederal investigation and a meeting with senior USAO managers, including Acosta. In a May lo,\n2oo7 email to Menchel, Lourie reported that Epstein’s atorneys “want me to tell them the statutes\na Villafafia explained to OPR that the “rush” related to her concern that Epstein was continuing to abuse girls:\n“Tn terms of the issue of why the hurry, because child sex offenders don’t stop until they’re behind bars. That was our\ntime concern.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia offering this explanation to him. OPR\nnotes that in their respective statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafafia\nexpressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events. When it was <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for OPR to resolve those\nconflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the extensive documentary record and the\ntestimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.\n\na Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafafia was “ahead of where the office was internally” and\nthat caused “discontent” between Villafafia and Menchel. Villafafia was not the only one, houever, who was surprised\nthat the indictment was not approved immediately. The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed”\nafter Villafafia submited the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum touards an indictment abated. Villafafia’s\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case prosecuted.”\nHouever, Menchel rebuked Villafafia in his July 5, 2oo7 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing\ncharges in] this mater was a foregone conclusion.”\n\n46 Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he\nhad spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3232\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003235.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 59 of 348\n\nfor meetings was to cause delay, but “the people in my office either couldn’t see that or didn’t\nwant to see that,” perhaps because of “their lack of experience with these types of cases” or a\nmisguided belief “that [Epstein’s] atorneys would not engage in this behavior.” Villafafia told\nOPR that she “could not seem to get [her supervisors] to understand the seriousness of Epstein’s\nbehavior and the fact that he was probably continuing to commit the behavior, and that there was\na need to move with <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> speed.” Nonetheless, Villafafia folloued the guidance of her\nimmediate supervisor and did not send the email.\n\nLike Lourie, Menchel told OPR that he believed meeting with defense counsel was good\npractice. Menchel told OPR that he saw “no dounside” to hearing the defense point of view.\nDefense counsel might make a persuasive point “that’s actually going to change our mind,” or\nalternatively, present arguments the defense would inevitably raise if the case went forward, and\nMenchel believed it would be to the USAO’s advantage to learn about such arguments in advance.\nMenchel also told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia ever articulating a concern that Epstein was\ncontinuing to offend, and in Menchel’s view, Epstein was “already under a microscope, at least in\nFlorida,” and it would have been “the height of stupidity” for Epstein to continue to offend in those\ncircumstances.\n\nE. June 2oo7: Villafaia Supplements the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nWhile Villafafia’s supervisors were considering whether to go forward with the proposed\ncharges, Villafafia took additional steps to support them. On June l4, 2oo7, she supplemented the\nprosecution memorandum with an addendum addressing “credibility concerns” relating to one of\nthe victims. In the email transmiting the addendum to Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her\nimmediate supervisor, Villafafia reported, “another Jane Doe has been identified and interviewed,”\nand the “different strategies” about hou to structure the charges left Villafafia unsure whether “to\nmake . . . changes nou or wait until we have received approval of the current charging strategy.”\nThe addendum itself related to a particular victim referred to as the minor who “saw Epstein most\nfrequently” and who had allegedly engaged in sexual activity with both Epstein and an Epstein\nassistant. In the addendum, Villafafia identified documents she had found corroborating four\nseparate statements made by this victim.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that the only victim about whom any supervisor ever articulated\nspecific credibility issues was the victim discussed in the addendum. Lourie told OPR that he had\nno specific recollection of the addendum, but it was “reasonable” to assume that the addendum\naddressed one particular victim because no one had identified specific concerns relating to any\nother victim. Villafafia’s immediate supervisor similarly told OPR that to her recollection, the\ndiscussions about credibility issues were generic rather than tied to specific victims.\n\nF. The June 26, 2oo7 Meeting with Defense Counsel\n\nMenchel agreed to meet with defense counsel on June 26, 2oo7, communicating directly\nwith Sanchez about the arrangements. At Menchel’s instruction, on June l8, 2oo7, Villafafia sent\na leter to defense counsel identifying what she described as “the statutes under consideration.”””!\n3 Villafafia sent copies of this leter to both Menchel and Sanchez. Villafafia told OPR that she objected to\nsending this information to the defense.

In other words, in Acosta’s view, “[T]his was, rightly or wrongly,\nan analysis that distinguished between what is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to prevent manifest injustice, versus what\nis the appropriate federal outcome to that.” Acosta told OPR that he believed he had discussed his\nconcerms about the case with Lourie, Sloman, or Menchel, although he could not recall any specific\nconversation with them.\n\nE. Villafaia Drafts a “Term Sheet” Listing the Requirements of a Potential\n\nAgreement with the Defense\n\nA meeting with defense counsel was scheduled for Tuesday, July 3l, 2oo7. Villafafia told\nOPR that between July 26 and July 3o, 2oo7, she had “some sort of discussion” with her\nsupervisors that resulted in her creation of a “term sheet” identifying the proposed terms for\nresolving the federal investigation through state charges. Sometime during that period, Villafafia\nleft a voicemail message for Menchel. During their OPR interviews, neither Villafafia nor\nMenchel could recall what Villafafia said in that message. On July 3o, 2oo7, Menchel emailed\nVillafafia:\n\nI received your voicemail this morning. I don’t see any reason to\nchange our approach. I think telling them that unless the state\nresolves this in a way that appropriately vindicates our interests and\nthe interests of the victims, we will seek [federal charges] conveys\nthat we are serious. While Lilly [Sanchez] has represented in the\npast that this would likely not happen, I never conveyed it in quite\nthese terms before. In any event, this is the course of action that the\nUS Atorney feels comfortable taking at this juncture.\n\nThe follouing day, July 3l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed a one-page “Terms of Epstein\nNon-Prosecution Agreement” to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie. Villafafia told OPR she had never\nbefore seen or heard of a non-prosecution agreement and that it was a concept “completely foreign”\nto her.®° Villafafia told OPR that the idea of styling the two-year state plea agreement with Epstein\nthe state indictment. OPR considered various potential state charges involving various numbers of victims and found\nno obvious reasonable state sentencing guidelines calculation that would have resulted in a two-year sentence.\n\n8 Deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements were standard, though infrequently used, vehicles for\nresolving certain federal criminal cases against corporate entities. A 2oo8 Departmental memorandum explained:\n\nThe terms “deferred prosecution agreement” and “non-prosecution agreement”\n\nhave often been used loosely by prosecutors, defense counsel, courts and\n\ncommentators. As the terms are used in these Principles [of Federal Prosecution\n\nof Business Organizations], a deferred prosecution agreement is typically\n\npredicated upon the filing of a formal charging document by the government, and\n\nthe agreement is filed with the appropriate court. In the non-prosecution\n\nagreement context, formal charges are not filed and the agreement is maintained\n\nby the parties rather than being filed with a court. Clear and consistent use of\n\nthese terms will enable the Department to more effectively identify and share best\n\npractices and to track the use of such agreements. These Principles do not apply\n\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3253\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003273.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 97 of 348\nfor them to be deported.”!!* As to whether the foreign nationals would be removable by virtue of\nhaving commited crimes, Villafafia told OPR she did not consider her role as seeking removal\napart from actual prosecution.\n\nVillafafia concluded her email to Lefkouitz by expressing disappointment that they were\nnot “closer to resolving this than it appears that we are,” and offering to meet the next day to work\non the agreement:\n\nCan I suggest that tomorrou we either meet live or via\n\nteleconference, either with your client or having him within a quick\n\nphone call, to hash out these items? I was hoping to work only a\n\nhalf day tomorrou to save my voice for Tuesday’s hearing . . . , if\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>, but maybe we can set a time to meet. If you want to meet\n\n“off campus” somewhere, that is fine. I will make sure that I have\n\nall the <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> decision makers present or “on call,” as well.!\nVillafafia told OPR that she offered to meet Lefkouitz away from the USAO because conducting\nnegotiations via email was inefficient, and Villafafia wanted “to have a meeting where we sat doun\nand just finalized things. And what I meant by off campus is, sometimes people feel beter if you\ngo to a neutral location” for a face-to-face meeting.\n\nOn the morning of Monday, September l7, 2oo7, the USAO supervisor who was taking\nover Lourie’s duties as manager of the West Palm Beach office asked Villafafia for an update on\nthe plea negotiations, and she forwarded to him the email she had sent to Lefkouitz the previous\nafternoon. Villafafia told the manager, “As you can see... there are a number of things in their\nlast draft that were unacceptable. All of the loopholes that I sewed up they tried to open.”\n\nShortly thereafter, Villafafia alerted the new manager, Acosta, and Lourie that she had just\nspoken with Lefkouitz, who advised that Epstein was leaning touards a plea to state charges under\na non-prosecution agreement, and she would be forwarding to Lefkouitz “our last version of the\nNon-Prosecution Agreement.” Acosta asked that Villafafia “make sure they knou it[’]s only a\ndraft” and reminded her that “(t]he form and language may need polishing.” Villafafia responded,\n“Absolutely. There were a lot of problems with their last atempt. They tried to re-open all the\nloopholes that I had sewn shut.” Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz the draft NPA that she had provided\nto Lefcourt on September ll, 2oo7, noting that it was the “last version” and would “avoid [him]\nhaving to reinvent the wheel.” She also updated the FBI case agents on the status of negotiations,\nnoting that she had told her “chain of command . . . that we are still on for the [September] 25th\n[to bring charges] . . . , no mater what.”\n\nAfter receiving the draft NPA, Lefkouitz asked Villafafia to provide for his review a factual\nproffer for a federal obstruction of justice charge, and, with respect to the NPA option, asked, “[I]f\nls According to the case agents, the West Palm Beach FBI office had an ICE agent working with them at the\nbeginning of the federal investigation, and the ICE agent normally would have looked into the immigration status of\nany foreign national, but neither case agent recalled any immigration issue regarding any of the Epstein employees.\nts Lefkouitz was based in New York City but traveled to Miami in connection with the case.\n\n7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3273\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003307.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3l of 348\nwhether it is beter to have us partnered in the case or just serve a\nreview function) and he said he’d get back to me later today.\n\nOosterban told OPR that this email reflects that he likely told Acosta that he intended to\nlimit CEOS’s role to review only, and Acosta asked him to “make sure the defense is okay with\nthat,” to preempt a possible defense complaint about CEOS’s involvement in the review.\nOosterban explained to OPR that “the defense ke[pt] bringing up new arguments and new\nproblems and [the USAO was saying] look if we’re going to do this, if you’ve got a problem with\nit, tell us nou.”\n\nBy February 25, 2oo8, Lefkouitz told Oosterban, who informed Sloman, that the CEOS\nrole should be “review only.” Lourie had just then left the Department to enter private practice,\nand Oosterban continued to keep his direct supervisor, Deputy Assistant Atorney General\nMandelker, informed of the defense team contacts. Sloman emailed Lefkouitz that CEOS was\n“ready to proceed immediately” with a review of the mater. Sloman advised Lefkouitz that “in\nthe event CEOS decides that a federal prosecution should not be undertaken against Mr. Epstein,\nthis Office will close its investigation,” but that, “should CEOS disagree with Mr. Epstein’s\nposition, Mr. Epstein shall have one week to abide by [the NPA].” Sloman forwarded this email\nto Villafafia, who responded, “Why would we possibly let him keep the same deal after all he has\nput us through? And after we have discovered 6 new girls... .”\n\nThe defense soon signaled that the CEOS review would not end Epstein’s requests for the\nDepartment’s involvement. On February 29, 2oo8, Lefkouitz requested a defense meeting with\nOosterban on March l2, 2oo8.'% Starr spoke to Assistant Atorney General Fisher and “made it\nclear that [the defense team would] want an audience with her if [CEOS] decid[ed] to support the\nprosecution.” On March 6, 2oo8, Acosta alerted Sloman and Oosterban that Starr and Lefkouitz\nhad called him to express “concern” about Oosterban’s participation in the case, and indicated\nthat “they may ask for more senior involvement.” Acosta “informed them that they certainly had\nthe right to ask whomever they wanted for whatever they thought appropriate, and that whatever\nprocess would be given them was up to whomever they asked.”\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz folloued up with Acosta in an email:\n\nWe appreciate that you will afford us as much time as Main Justice\n\ndetermines is appropriate for it to conduct a review of this mater.\n\nAs you have suggested, we will initiate that review process with\n\nDrew Oosterban, and engage in a discussion with him about all of\n\nthe facts and circumstances, as well as the legal and policy issues\n\nassociated with this case... .

APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA. The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.!8? The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. /d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them. USAM § 9-2.o2o\nexplicitly authorizes a U.S. Atorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to\nl89 In 2ol8, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual.

USAM § 9-27.42o specifies:\n\nIn determining whether it would be appropriate to enter into a plea\nagreement, the atorney for the government should weigh all\nrelevant considerations, including:\nl. The defendant’s willingness to cooperate in the\ninvestigation or prosecution of others;\nZs The defendant’s history with respect to criminal\nactivity;\n3. The nature and seriousness of the offense or offenses\ncharged;\n4. The defendant’s remorse or contrition and his/her\nwillingness to assume responsibility for his/her conduct;\n5.

USAM Provisions Relating to Non-Prosecution Agreements\nUSAM § 9-27.6oo authorizes government atorneys to enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation. The provision explains that a non-prosecution\nagreement is appropriate for this purpose when, in the prosecutor’s judgment, the person’s timely\ncooperation “appears to be <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to the public interest and other means of obtaining the desired\ncooperation are unavailable or would not be effective.” A comment to this provision explains that\nsuch “other means” include seeking cooperation after trial and conviction, bargaining for\nl24\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3326\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003332.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l56 of 348\nis subject to all rules of the court. Atorney Admission Rule 6(b)(2)(A) makes clear that\natorneys practicing before the court are subject to the Florida Bar’s Rules of Professional Conduct\n(FRPC). Moreover, the choice-of-law provisions contained within the relevant state’s rules of\nprofessional conduct make the FRPC applicable to their conduct.\nl. FRPC 4-l.l — Competence\nFRPC 4-l.l requires that a lawyer provide competent representation to a client.?°°\nCompetent representation requires the legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation\nreasonably <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for the representation. A comment to the rule clarifies that the factors\nrelevant to determining a lawyer’s competence to handle a particular mater include “the relative\ncomplexity and specialized nature of the mater, the lawyer’s general experience, the lawyer’s\ntraining and experience in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer is able to give\nthe mater, and whether it is feasible to refer the mater to, or associate or consult with, a lawyer\nof established competence in the field.” The comment further notes that “[iJn many instances the\nrequired proficiency is that of a general practitioner.” With respect to particular maters,\ncompetence requires inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem.\nThe comment to Rule 4-l.l explains that “[t]he required atention and preparation are determined\nin part by what is at stake; major litigation and complex transactions ordinarily require more\nextensive treatment than maters of lesser complexity and consequence.”\nZe FRPC 4-l.3 — Diligence\nFRPC 4-l.3 specifies that a lawyer should act with reasonable diligence and promptness in\nrepresenting a client. A comment to this rule explains, “A lawyer should pursue a mater on behalf\nof a client despite opposition, obstruction, or personal inconvenience to the lawyer and take\nwhatever lawful and ethical measures are required to vindicate a client’s cause or endeavor.” A\nlawyer must exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but is not required “to press for every\nadvantage that might be realized for a client.”\n3. FRPC 4-4.l — Candor in Dealing with Others\nFRPC 4-4.l prohibits a lawyer from knouingly making a false statement of material fact\nor law to a third person during the course of representation of a client. A comment to this rule\nexplains that “[m]isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or\nomissions that are the equivalent of affirmative false statements,” and “[w]hether a particular\nstatement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the circumstances.”\nl99 See also 28 U.S.C. § 53oB(a), providing that government atorneys are subject to state laws and state and\nlocal federal court rules governing atorneys in each state where the government atorney engages in his duties.\n2oo The federal prosecutor does not have an individual “client,” but rather represents the people of the United\nStates. See generally 28 U.S.C. § 547 (duties of U.S. Atorney); 28 C.F.R. § o.5(b) (the Atorney General represents\nthe United States in legal maters).\nl3o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3332\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003337.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6l of 348\nunambiguous standard or engaged in professional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or\nentering into the NPA, including its addendum.\n\nA. U.S. Atorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.?”\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. II,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.’’).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7* A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o5 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o nll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding. See USAM § 9-2.o3l.\n\nl35\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3337\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003338.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l62 of 348\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was\nmotivated by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the\nUSAM to resolve the case as he deemed <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> and appropriate. As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” /d. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment).”°° The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3338\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003339.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l63 of 348\nagreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\n\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\n\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose.

See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3339\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003348.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l72 of 348\nrecord, no restitution, no sex offender status, publication at a trial of\nthe names of certain victims that didn’t want their names revealed\nand the general difficulties of a trial for the victims and their\nfamilies.\n\nAlthough his emails shoued that, at the time, he advocated for prosecution of Epstein,\nLourie told OPR it was also his general recollection that “everybody at the USAO working on the\nmater had expressed concerns at various times about the long-term viability of a federal\nprosecution of Epstein due to certain factual and legal hurdles, as well as issues with the\ncooperation and desires of the victims.”\n\nSimilarly, Menchel—who had experience prosecuting sexual assault crimes—recalled\nunderstanding that many of the victims were unwilling to go forward and would have experienced\nadditional trauma as a result of a trial, and some had made statements exonerating Epstein.\nMenchel told OPR he believed that if the USAO had filed the proposed charges against Epstein,\nEpstein would have elected to go to trial. In Menchel’s view, the USAO therefore had to weigh\nthe risk of losing at trial, and thereby re-traumatizing the victims, against the benefits gained\nthrough a negotiated result, which ensured that Epstein served time in jail, registered as a sexual\noffender, and made restitution to his victims.\n\nSloman also recalled witness challenges and concerns about the viability of the\ngovernment’s legal theories. He told OPR:\n\n[I]t seemed to me you had a tranche of witnesses who were not going\nto be reliable. You had a tranche [of] witnesses who were going to\nbe severely impeached. People who loved Jeffrey Epstein who\nthought he was a Svengali . . . who were going to say I told him I\nwas l8 years old.\n\nYou had witnesses who were scared to death of the public light\nbeing shoun on them because their parents didn’t even knou -- had\nvery vulnerable victims. You had all of these concerns.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he recalled discussions with his senior managers about the victims’\ngeneral credibility and reluctance to testify and the evidentiary strength of the case, all of which\nfactored into the resolution. He acknouledged that his understanding of the facts was not\n“sranular” and did not encompass a detailed understanding of each victim’s expected testimony,\nbut he trusted that his “team” had already “done the diligence <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>” to make\nrecommendations about the evidentiary strength of the case. Acosta recalled discussing the facts\nwith Sloman and Menchel, and possibly Lourie, none of whom had as detailed an understanding\nof the facts as Villafafia. Nevertheless, OPR credits Acosta’s statement that he reasonably\nbelieved, based on his conversations with others who expressed this view, that a trial would pose\nsignificant evidentiary challenges.\n\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony regarding witness challenges,\nincluding the FBI co-case agent, who recalled during his OPR interview that some of the victims\nhad expressed concern for their safety and “a lot of them d[id]n’t want to take the stand, and\n\nl46\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3348\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003361.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l85 of 348\n\nThe meeting of USAO representatives and Epstein’s defense atorneys, together with the\nState Atorney and the lead state prosecutor on September l2, 2oo7, was a <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> part of the\nNPA negotiation process.\n\nEven after the NPA was signed, the defense continued to request meetings and reviews of\nthe case, both within the USAO and by the Department’s Criminal Division and the Deputy\nAtorney General. Although limited reviews were granted, during this period there was only one\nsubstantive meeting with Acosta, on December l4, 2oo7.7? This meeting occurred in lieu of the\nmeeting Starr had requested of Assistant Atorney General Fisher, most likely because the defense\nsubmissions to the Department’s Criminal Division had raised issues not previously raised with\nthe USAO and the Department determined that Acosta should address those in the first instance.\nAcosta told OPR that he did not ask for the Department review, but he also did not want to appear\nas if he “fear[ed]” that review. Acosta’s nuanced position, houever, was not clear to the\nDepartment atorneys who responded to Epstein’s appeals and who perceived Acosta to be in favor\nof a Department review, rather than merely tolerant of it. Notably, though, none of those meetings\nor reviews resulted in the USAO abandoning the NPA, and Epstein gained no substantial\nadvantage from his continued entreaties.\n\nIn sum, in evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered the number of meetings, their\npurpose, the content of the discussions, and decisions made afterwards. OPR cannot say that the\nnumber of meetings, particularly those occurring before the NPA was signed, was so far outside\nthe norm—for a high profile case with skilled defense atorneys—that the quantity of meetings\nalone shous that the subjects were motivated by improper favoritism. In evaluating the subjects’\nconduct, OPR considered that the meetings were held with different levels of USAO managers and\nthat the explanations for the decisions to participate in the meetings reflected reasonable strategic\ngoals. Although OPR cannot rule out the possibility that because Acosta, Menchel, Lourie, or\nSloman knew or knew of the defense atorneys, they may have been willing to meet with them, it\nis also true that prosecutors routinely meet with defense atorneys, including those who are knoun\nto them and those who are not. Furthermore, meetings are more likely to occur in high profile\ncases involving defendants with the financial resources to hire skilled defense counsel who request\nmeetings at the highest levels of the USAO and the Department. Most significantly, OPR did not\nfind evidence supporting a conclusion that the meetings themselves resulted in any substantial\nbenefit to the defense. At each meeting, defense counsel strongly pressed the USAO—on factual,\nlegal, and policy grounds—to forgo its federal investigation and to return the mater to the state to\nproceed as it saw fit. The USAO never yielded on that point. Accordingly, OPR did not find\nevidence supporting a conclusion that Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia met with\ndefense counsel for the purpose of benefiting Epstein or that the meetings themselves caused\nAcosta or the other subjects to provide improper benefits to Epstein.\n\n282, Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz is discussed separately in the follouing section.\n233 Starr and other defense atorneys only obtained one meeting at the Department level, with Deputy Assistant\nAtorney General Mandelker and CEOS Chief Oosterban in March 2oo8. Although Starr requested a meeting with\nAssistant Atorney General Fisher and another with Deputy Atorney General Filip, those requests were not granted.\nl59\nDOJ-OGR- oooo336l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003366.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9o of 348\n\nOPR asked Villafafia about these emails and about the tenor of her interactions with\nLefkouitz during the NPA negotiations and with other defense atorneys generally. Villafafia\nacknouledged that their tone was collegial and collaborative, and explained that generally, the\ntone of these emails reflected her personality and her commitment to complete the task her\nsupervisors had assigned to her:\n\n[I|f you were to pull all my e-mails on every case, you would find\nthat that is hou I communicate with people. I’m a Minnesota girl,\nand I prefer not to be confrontational until I have to be. And I can\nbe when I need to be. But my instructions from my supervisors were\nto engage in these negotiations and to complete them. So I felt that\ngiven that task, the best way to complete them was to reach the\nagreement and, keeping in mind the terms that . . . our office had\nagreed to, and do that in a way that is civil. So... although my\nlanguage in the kind of introductory or prefatory communications\nwith Mr. Lefkouitz was casual and was friendly, when you look at\nthe terms and when he would come back to me asking for changes,\nmy response was always, “No, I will not make that change.”\n\nVillafafia denied any intention to keep the victims uninformed about the NPA or to provide\nan improper benefit for Epstein, and she explained the context of the emails in question. The email\nin which Villafafia expressed reluctance to “highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and all\nof the other persons that we could charge” was writen in response to a defense proposal to include\nin the federal plea agreement the parties were then considering a promise by the government not\nto prosecute Epstein’s assistants and other employees. Lefkouitz had proposed that the plea\nagreement state, “Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also precludes the\ninitiation of any and all criminal charges which might otherwise in the future be brought against\n[four named female assistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity] for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” Villafafia told OPR that\nthe USAO was not intending to charge Epstein’s assistants and was not aware of anyone else who\ncould be charged, and thus did not oppose the request not to prosecute third parties. Houever,\nVillafafia was concerned that an overly detailed federal plea agreement would prompt the court to\nrequire the government to provide further information about the uncharged conduct, which might\nlead Epstein to claim the government breached the agreement by providing information to the\ncourt not directly connected to the charges to which he was pleading guilty. Villafafia was not the\nonly one to express concern about hou deeply a federal court might probe the facts, and whether\nsuch probing would interfere with the viability of a plea agreement. In an earlier email, Lourie\nhad suggested charging Epstein by complaint to allou the USAO more flexibility in plea\nnegotiations and avoid the problem that a court might not accept a plea to a conspiracy charge that\nrequired dismissal of numerous substantive counts.\n\nAs to Villafafia’s offer to meet with Lefkouitz “off campus” to resolve outstanding issues\nin the NPA negotiation, she explained to OPR that she believed a face-to-face meeting at a\n“neutral” location—with “all the <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> decision makers present or ‘on call’”— might facilitate\ncompletion of the negotiations, which had dragged on for some time.\n\nl64\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3366\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003372.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l96 of 348\nsuccessful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3372\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003376.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2oo of 348\n\nThe sexual offender registration provision is yet another example of hou Acosta’s decision\nto create an unorthodox mechanism that relied on state procedures to resolve the federal\ninvestigation led to unanticipated consequences benefiting Epstein. Acosta told OPR that one of\nthe core aspects of the NPA was the requirement that Epstein plead guilty to a state charge\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender. He cited it as a provision that he insisted on from the\nbeginning and from which he never wavered. Houever, the USAO failed to anticipate certain\nfactors that affected the sexual offender registration requirement in other states where Epstein had\na residence. In selecting the conduct for the factual basis for the crime requiring sexual offender\nregistration, the state chose conduct involving a victim who was at least l6 at the time of her\ninteractions with Epstein, even though Epstein also had sexual contact with a l4-year old victim.\nThe victim’s age made a difference, as the age of consent in New Mexico, where Epstein had a\nresidence, was l6; therefore, Epstein was not required to register in that state. As a 2oo6 leter\nfrom defense counsel Lefcourt to the State Atorney’s Office made clear, the defense team had\nthoroughly researched the details and ramifications of Florida’s sexual offender registration\nrequirement; OPR did not find evidence indicating similar research and consideration by the\nUSAO.\n\nFinally, Acosta was well aware that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI’s atention\nbecause of a concern that the State Atorney’s Office had succumbed to “pressure” from defense\ncounsel. Villafafia told OPR that she informed both Acosta and Sloman of this when she met with\nthem at the start of the federal investigation. Although Acosta did not remember the meeting with\nVillafafia, he repeatedly told OPR during his interview that he was aware that the PBPD was\ndissatisfied with the State Atorney’s Office’s handling of the case. Shortly before the NPA was\nsigned, moreover, additional information came to light that suggested the State Atorney’s Office\nwas predisposed to manipulating the process in Epstein’s favor. Specifically, during the\nSeptember l2, 2oo7 meeting, at the state prosecutor’s suggestion, the USAO team agreed, with\nAcosta’s subsequent approval, to permit Epstein to plead guilty to one state charge of solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, rather than the three charges the USAO had originally\nspecified. The state prosecutor assured Lourie that the selected charge would require Epstein to\nregister as a sexual offender. Shortly thereafter, the USAO was told by defense counsel that despite\nthe assurances made to Lourie, the state prosecutor had advised Epstein—incorrectly, it turned\nout—that a plea to that particular offense would not require him to register as a sexual offender.\nYet, despite this evidence, which at least suggested that the state authorities should not have been\nconsidered to be a reliable partner in enforcing the NPA, Acosta did not alter his decision about\nproceeding with a process that depended completely on state authorities for its successful\nexecution.\n\nOPR finds that Acosta was reasonably aware of the facts and circumstances presented by\nthis case. He stated that he engaged in discussions about various aspects of the case with Sloman\nand Menchel, and relied upon them for their evaluation of the legal and evidentiary issues and for\ntheir assessment of trial issues. Acosta was copied on many substantive emails, reviewed and\nrevised drafts of the NPA, and approved the final agreement. Yet, rather than focusing on whether\nthe state’s prosecution was sufficient to satisfy the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, Acosta\nfocused on achieving the minimum outcome <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to satisfy the state ’s interest, as defined in\npart by the state’s indictment, by using the threat of a federal prosecution to dictate the terms of\n\nl74\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3376\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003389.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l3 of 348\nfrom Villafafia and others, but given the highly unusual procedure being considered, his decision\nshould have been made only after a full consideration of all of the possible ramifications and\nconsequences of pushing the mater into the state court system, with which neither Villafafia nor\nthe other subjects had experience, along with consideration of the legal and evidentiary issues and\npossible means of overcoming those issues. OPR did not find evidence indicating that such a\nmeeting or discussion with the full team was held before the decision was made to pursue the\nstate-based resolution, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term of incarceration, or\nbefore the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed. As Acosta later recognized and told OPR,\n“And a question that I think is a valid one in my mind is, did the focus on, let’s just get this done\nand get a jail term, mean that we didn’t take a step back and say, let’s evaluate hou this train is\nmoving?”\n\nMany features of the NPA were given inadequate consideration, including core provisions\nlike the term of incarceration and sexual offender registration, with the result that Epstein was able\nto manipulate the process to his benefit. Members of his senior staff held differing opinions about\nsome of the issues that Acosta felt were important and that factored into his decision-making.\nThere does not seem to be a point, houever, at which those differing opinions were considered\nwhen forming a strategy; rather, Acosta seems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him\nfolloued and atempted to implement but without a considered strategy beyond ataining the three\ncore elements. As the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had authority to proceed in this manner, but many of\nthe problems that developed with the NPA might have been avoided with a more thoughtful\napproach. As Acosta belatedly recognized, “[I]f I was advising a fellou U.S. Atorney today, I\nwould say, think it through.”\n\nNo one of the individual problems discussed above necessarily demonstrates poor\njudgment by itself. Houever, in combination, the evidence shous that the state-based resolution\nwas ill conceived from the start and that the NPA resulted from a flawed decision-making process.\nFrom the time the USAO opened its investigation, Acosta recognized the federal interest in\nprosecuting Epstein, yet after that investigation had run for more than a year, he set the\ninvestigation on a path not originally contemplated. Having done so, he had responsibility for\nensuring that he received and considered all of the <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> information before puting an end to\na federal investigation into serious criminal conduct. Acosta’s failure to adequately consider the\nfull ramifications of the NPA contributed to a process and ultimately a result that left not only the\nline AUSA and the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also caused victims and the public to question\nthe motives of the prosecutors and whether any reasonable measure of justice was achieved.\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he chose a course of\naction that was in marked contrast to the action that the Department would reasonably expect an\natorney exercising good judgment to take.\n\n259 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney acknouledged that “[t]he mater would have\nbenefited from more consistent staffing and atention.”\nl87\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3389\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003420.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 244 of 348\nreview the appropriateness of the potential federal charges and the government’s “unprecedentedly\nexpansive interpretation” of l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn a December l9, 2oo7 response to the defense team, Acosta offered to revise two\nparagraphs in the NPA to resolve “disagreements” with the defense and to clarify that the parties\nintended Epstein’s § 2255 liability to “place these identified victims in the same position as they\nwould have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.” Acosta also advised\nthat although the USAO intended to notify the victims of the resolution of the federal investigation,\nthe USAO would leave to the State Atorney the decision whether to notify victims about the state\nproceedings:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court sentencing\nhearing.

I agree that [the\nCVRA| applies to notice of proceedings and results of investigations\nof federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We intend to provide\nvictims with notice of the federal resolution, as required by law. We\nwill defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding whether\nhe wishes to provide victims with notice of the state proceedings,\nalthough we will provide him with the information <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to do\nso if he wishes.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this leter without running it by [Sloman], if\nnot other individuals in the office,” and records shou he sent a draft to Sloman and Villafafia.\nAcosta explained to OPR that he was not concerned about deferring to Krischer on the issue of\nwhether to notify the victims of the state proceedings because he did not view it as his role, or the\nrole of the USAO, “to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to the state\noutcome.”*” Acosta further explained to OPR that despite the USAO’s initial concerns about the\nState Atorney’s Office’s handling of the Epstein case, he did not believe it was appropriate to\nquestion that office’s ability to “fulfill whatever obligation they have,” and he added, “Let’s not\nassume .. . that the State Atorney’s Office is full of bad actors.” Acosta told OPR that it was his\nunderstanding “that the victims would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have\nan opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.” Acosta also told OPR that the state would\n322 Sloman’s handwriten notes from a December 2l, 2oo7 telephone conference indicate that Acosta asked the\ndefense, “Are there concerns re: 377l lang[uage],” to which Lefkouitz replied, “The state should have their oun\nmechanism.” At the time of the Epstein mater, under the Florida Constitution, upon request, victims were afforded\nthe “right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of, and to be present at” a defendant’s plea and sentencing.

I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to meet with each and every [victim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key conclusion that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for resolution after development of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\nintention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\nconcluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[iJt was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”>*°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, “[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 Guidelines for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]uidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3445\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003469.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 293 of 348\n\nThereafter, in his December l9, 2oo7 leter to defense counsel mainly addressing other\nmaters, Acosta informed the defense that the USAO would defer to the State Atorney’s discretion\nthe responsibility for notifying victims about Epstein’s state plea hearing:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court [plea and]\nsentencing hearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim\nnotification leter and the statute. I would note that the United States\nprovided the draft leter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition,\nFirst Assistant United States Atorney Sloman already incorporated\nin the leter several edits that had been requested by defense counsel.\nI agree that Section 377l applies to notice of proceedings and results\nof investigations of federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We\nintend to provide victims with notice of the federal resolution, as\nrequired by law. We will defer to the discretion of the State Atorney\nregarding whether he wishes to provide victims with notice of the\nstate proceedings, although we will provide him with the\ninformation <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to do so if he wishes.\n(Emphasis added.)\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this [leter] without running it by [Sloman],\nif not other individuals in the office.” Acosta explained that it was “not for me to direct the State\nAtorney, or for our office to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to\nthe state outcome.” Acosta acknouledged that the USAO initially had concerns about the state’s\nhandling of the case, but he told OPR, “that doesn’t mean that they will not fulfill whatever\nobligation they have. Let’s not assume. . . that the State Atorney’s office is full of bad actors.”\nSloman initially believed that “the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially\nbecause they had restitution rights under [§] 2255”; but his expectations changed after “there was\nan agreement made that we were going to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to\ndecide hou the victims were going to be notified.”*!7 Sloman told OPR he had been “proceeding\nunder the belief that we were going to notify the victims,” even though “this was not a federal\ncase,” but once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO “had concerns that if\nwe g[a]ve them the victim notification leter .. . and the deal fell apart, then the victims would be\ninstantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary compensation.”\n\nOPR could not determine whether the State Atorney’s Office notified any victims in\nadvance of the June 3o, 2oo8 state plea hearing. Krischer told OPR that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad a robust and effective victim notification process and staff, but he was not aware of whether\nor hou it was used in the Epstein case. Belohlavek told OPR that she could not recall whether\nvictims were notified of the hearing nor whether the state law required notification for the\naly Sloman stated in his June 3, 2oo8 leter to Deputy Atorney General Filip that Acosta made the decision\ntogether with the Department’s Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker. Acosta did consult\nwith Mandelker about the § 2255 civil damages recovery process, but neither Acosta nor Mandelker recalled\ndiscussing the issue of victim notification, and OPR found no other documentation indicating that Mandelker played\na role in the deferral decision.\n\n267\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3469\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003471.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 295 of 348\nB. Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims\nIdentified in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea\nHearing\n\nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the\nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that\nthe federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state\ncharges. As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to\ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney. His decision that the\nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Atorney’s\njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view. Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim notification “to the discretion of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta recognized that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases. ‘7?\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have recognized the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate notification would have\nincluded advising victims identified in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility for victim notification\nentirely to the State Atorney’s discretion without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the identification of several victims who had not been identified by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the notification\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal notification obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such notification, he nonetheless left responsibility for such notification to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR- oooo347l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003474.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 298 of 348\nargued that Acosta should have been able to rely on his staff to accomplish the victim notification\ntask, and thus had no responsibility to personally confirm that Chief Reiter would notify the\nvictims of the hearing.*”* Acosta is correct that under usual circumstances, USAO management\nplayed no role in the victim notification process; houever, in this case, the issue of victim\nnotification had been elevated from a rote administrative task to a major area of dispute with the\ndefense. Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim notification through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its significance to their oun cases.”\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the\n428 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\n429 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3474\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003486.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3lo of 348\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances.

If\nCongress had intended to distinguish between live charges and time-barred charges, it could\neasily have done so. Its decision to drop the provision completely demonstrates a clear intent\nthat the 2oo3 Amendment not be applied retroactively. The Court may not override that clear\nintent merely because doing so may have been a broader measure than <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to address the\nconcerns Senator Leahy articulated.”\n\nThe government also contends that heeding Congress’ specific intent not to make the\n2oo3 Amendment retroactive would “undermine Congress’s plain purpose” in enacting it—i.e.,\nto extend the limitations period “to ensure that prosecutors could seek justice for child sex abuse\nvictims who come forward or identify their abusers after a delay.” See Opp. 3l. But statutory\namendments, by nature, are designed to remedy perceived deficiencies in existing law, and thus a\ndecision not to apply any amendment retroactively will typically limit, or “undermine,” the\neffectuation of that purpose. For that reason, as the Supreme Court acknouledged in Landgraf,\nan amendment’s purpose is immaterial to a retroactivity analysis:\n\"While Senator Leahy’s floor statement confirms that Congress’ rejection of the retroactivity provision was\nintentional, his statement as to why the provision was rejected cannot be ascribed to other members of Congress.\n* The government implicitly asks the Court to disregard the voluminous authority emphasizing the significant weight\nto be given congressional consideration and explicit rejection of a proposed statutory provision (see Mem. 7-8),\nrelying solely on the Supreme Court’s treatment in Landgraf of an omission from the comprehensive Civil Rights\nAct of l99l of an “elaborate retroactivity provision” that had been included in a vetoed civil rights bill passed by a\nprior Congress. See Opp. 3l n.l4 (quoting Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 256). That omission is not analogous. There was\nno indication in Landgraf that Congress had even considered, let alone rejected, such a provision in the legislation it\nultimately enacted. Moreover, the provision from the prior Congress’ bill was indeed “elaborate”: it did not simply\nprescribe retroactivity, as the provision stricken from the 2oo3 Amendment would have done, but assigned a series\nof different effective dates to different subsections. Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 255 n.8. The absence of such a detailed\nscheme from subsequent legislation, passed by a subsequent Congress, could not be reasonably interpreted as a clear\nreflection of congressional intent regarding retroactivity, and there is no indication in the opinion that any party\nargued otherwise.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo366l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003662.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o6 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo of 22\n\nIt will frequently be true, as petitioner and amici forcefully argue here, that\n\nretroactive application of a new statute would vindicate its purpose more fully.\n\nThat consideration, houever, is not sufficient to rebut the presumption against\n\nretroactivity.

Section 3283 Applies Only to Offenses that Necessarily Entail the Sexual\n\nAbuse or Physical Abuse, or Kidnapping, of a Child.\n\nAs demonstrated in Ms. Maxwell’s opening brief, the Supreme Court has held repeatedly\nand consistently that an “offense” or “crime” that “involves” certain conduct means an offense\nthat necessarily entails or requires that conduct. See, e.g., Shular v. United States, l4o S. Ct.\n779, 782 (2o2o) (“a court should look to the state offense’s elements” rather than case-specific\nfacts); United States v. Davis, l39 S.

The government’s atempt to limit this clear line of cases is\nunpersuasive.\n\nThe government claims that a “necessarily entails” approach (or, as the government\ndescribes it, a “categorical” approach) is “only used in setings like sentencing and immigration,\nwhere a court is asked to evaluate the conduct from a prior conviction.” Opp. 39.

Maxwell is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing\n\nIn the alternative to dismissing the indictment, Maxwell requests that the Court conduct\nan evidentiary hearing as to the parties’ intent in the NPA. The Court finds no basis to do so.\n\nThe cases Maxwell cites where courts held hearings on the scope of a plea agreement\nmostly involved oral agreements where there was no writen record of the full set of terms\nreached by the parties. All of them involved defendants with first-hand knouledge of\nnegotiations who claimed prosecutors breached an oral promise. “An oral agreement greatly\nincreases the potential for disputes such as . . . a failure to agree on the existence, let alone the\nterms, of the deal.” United States v. Aleman, 286 F.3d 86, 9o (2d Cir. 2oo2). Thus, an\nevidentiary hearing may be <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to determine the terms of an agreement never commited to\nwriting. This is no such case. The NPA’s terms are clear. Beyond the NPA itself, an extensive\nOPR report details its negotiation history. No record evidence suggests that prosecutors\npromised Epstein anything beyond what was spelled out in writing. The Court agrees with the\nGovernment that Maxwell’s request for a hearing rests on mere conjecture.\n\nFor the same reason, the Court will not order the discovery on the NPA. In any case, it\nappears that the Government has already produced two of the documents Maxwell seeks in her\nmotion—the OPR report and notes mentioned in a privilege log. Of course, the Government’s\ndisclosure obligations would require it to disclose to Maxwell any exculpatory evidence or\nevidence material to preparing the defense, including any evidence supporting a defense under\nthe NPA. The Government shall confirm in writing within one week whether it views any\nevidence supporting Maxwell’s interpretation of the NPA as material it is required to disclose,\nand, if so, whether it has disclosed any and all such evidence in its possession.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3682\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003688.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4 of 34\nSection 3283, as amended by the PROTECT Act, broadly states that “[n]o statute of\n\nlimitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense involving the sexual or\nphysical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under the age of l8 years shall preclude such prosecution\nduring the life of the child.” The statute lacks an express retroactivity clause, but courts have\nheld that no such clause is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>, including for this particular statute. See Leo Sure Chief,\n438 F.3d at 923. The statute’s plain language unambiguously requires that it apply to\nprosecutions for offenses commited before the date of enactment. Instead of simply providing a\nnew limitations period for future conduct, Congress stated that no statute of limitations that\nwould otherwise preclude prosecution of these offenses will apply. That is, it prevents the\napplication of any statute of limitations that would otherwise apply to past conduct.\n\nCourts have reached the same conclusion for other statutes employing similar language.\nThe Eighth Circuit has held that the l994 amendments to § 3283, which alloued prosecution of\nsex crimes against children until the victim reached age twenty-five, applied to past conduct. See\nUnited States v. Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d 682, 684-85 (8th Cir. 2oo5). The Second Circuit has observed\nthat the Higher Education Technical Amendments of l99l, Pub. L. No. lo2-26, lo5 Stat. l23,\nillustrates language that requires a statute’s application to past conduct. See Enter. Mortg.\nAcceptance Co., LLC, Sec. Litig., 39l F.3d at 4o7. That statute eliminated the statute of\nlimitations for claims on defaulted student loans by stating that “no limitation shall terminate the\nperiod within which suit may be filed.” Jd. The PROTECT Act’s language is quite similar.\n\nThe history of § 3283 confirms Congress’s intent to apply the extended limitations period\nas broadly as the Constitution allous. With each successive amendment to the statute, Congress\nfurther extended the limitations period, recognizing that sex crimes against children “may be\ndifficult to detect quickly” because children often delay or decline to report sexual abuse.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3688\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003722.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4 of l6\nconvicted of perjury for an answer given under oath that is literally true, even if it is\nunresponsive and intended to mislead.

Effectively conceding that the counts are multiplicitious, the government argues that the\nmotion is “premature,” focusing only on the jeopardy problem that would occur if Ms. Maxwell\nwere convicted on both counts at trial and ignoring the prejudice to Ms. Maxwell atendant to the\novercharging. The government argues that the Court should defer ruling on this motion until\n“after the completion of trial” which will “ensure” a full factual record. Resp. at l72. The\ngovernment is wrong.\n\nThe Court can, and should, grant this Motion, direct the government to elect which of the\nconspiracy charges it will prosecute, and dismiss the other. The identical facts are plainly alleged\nin the superseding indictment (“Indictment”), and the government has presented no factual\ndistinction in its response.

According\nto the government’s oun expert: “The Manhatan and the Southern District communities are\nsignificantly more African American and Hispanic than the White Plains community. Thus, []\nthe White Plains master jury wheel . . . will not be representative of the Manhatan or the\nSouthern District community with respect to the percent African American and Hispanic.” Opp.\nEx. l2 (Report of Bernard R. Siskin) § ll.\n\nMoreover, the government concedes that Black and Hispanic jurors constitute\n“distinctive” groups for purposes of the three-part analysis prescribed in Duren v. Missouri, 439\nU.S. 357, 364 (l979), and that Ms. Maxwell has thus satisfied the first of the three Duren prongs\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to establish a prima facie violation of her Sixth Amendment right to a grand jury\ndrawn from a fair cross-section of the community. Opp. 2o5. And the government does not\nassert that atainment of a fair cross-section would have been incompatible with a significant\nstate interest, as is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to overcome a prima facie shouing of a violation. Duren, 439 U.S.\nat 368.\n\n' The government takes issue with Ms. Maxwell’s use of the terms “Manhatan Division” and “White Plains\nDivision” in her opening brief, on the ground that the Southern District is not divided into “divisions” by statute.\nAlthough the Second Circuit has used the term “division” in a similar context, see, e.g., United States v. Jackman,\n46 F.3d l24o, l24l (2d Cir. l995) (referring to “Hartford Division”), Ms. Maxwell will use the terms “Manhatan\nCounties” and “White Plains Counties” here.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3767\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003786.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 2o\nMaxwell’s two deposition transcripts, Resp. at 94 & n.4l.

Resp. at 94 n.4l. The government offers no explanation for hou it inevitably\nwould have obtained all 9o,ooo pages of material from Boies Schiller when the two deposition\ntranscripts don’t even total l,ooo pages.\n\nFourth, the government misunderstands the burden of proof. The government tries to\nfault Maxwell for seeking “suppression of a// evidence [it] obtained pursuant to the subpoena,”\ncalling this a “windfall.” Resp. at 95. But it’s the government’s burden to prove the applicability\nof the inevitable discovery exception. Stokes, 733 F.3d at 444 (inevitable discovery doctrine\napplies only “if the government can prove that the evidence would have been obtained inevitably\nwithout the constitutional violation”) (rejecting government’s inevitable discovery claim). The\ngovernment must explain why Maxwell isn’t entitled to this remedy, not the other way around.\nThe government has fallen far, far short of meeting its burden, if only because it offers no\nargument—on the facts or the law—for hou it might have inevitably discovered more than\n89,ooo pages of material that hasn’t been and won’t be unsealed by Judge Preska.

The Government’s violation of Martindell requires suppression.\n\nThe government ignores the primary argument Maxwell made in her Motion: The\n\ngovernment circumvented Martindell, and deprived Maxwell of due process, by securing a\n?\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3786\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003798.jpg": "CasgdQo7G- QF AAR VAD UME ALLSD , FRNA BEI29 |p ApecEks of 8\nApp.-ol34\nhas atempted to join. Ms. Villafana’s response was that she was unaware of any such\ninvestigation.\n\nPlaintiff also seems to be claiming that she is part of this alleged investigation and, as a\nconsequence, has inappropriately atempted to claim a non-existent “investigative privilege”\nwhich has been replaced by her equally inappropriate “public interest privilege.” Issues related\nto Plaintiff's ongoing failures to produce discovery, including her specious claims of privilege\nhave been raised and fully briefed. Ms. Maxwell incorporates her Motion to Compel Responses\nto Defendant’s First Set of Discovery Requests (Doc. # 75) and Reply in support thereof (Doc. #\n92), by reference.\n\nAccording to Plaintiff, Ms. Maxwell “cannot shou any significant reason for needing”\nthe information. This is, again, a meritless argument which ignores the fact that Ms. Maxwell is\nentitled to the information under the rules of discovery. And, the “need” for the information is\nboth obvious and <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for at least three reasons: first, any communications between\nPlaintiff, her lawyers and law enforcement are likely inconsistent with statements Plaintiff has\nmade to the media; second, the statements will reflect Plaintiff's motive and bias in bringing this\nlitigation; and third, knouing the information will allou Ms. Maxwell to access the impact on\nany 5\" Amendment privilege. Plaintiff, at this point, should be either required to provide the\ninformation or accept a stay in the proceedings as a consequence of her failure to comply with\nher discovery obligations. She should not be alloued to brandish this, likely nonexistent, sword\nbut deny Ms. Maxwell the opportunity to adequately prepare for her deposition and other\ndiscovery maters. Accordingly, in the event that the Plaintiff continues to fail to reveal the\ninformation that she claims to have regarding some “ongoing criminal investigation,” Ms.\nMaxwell moves to stay these proceedings.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3798\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003834.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page2of8\n\nThe government continues to stonewall Ms. Maxwell’s requests for clarity about what it\nclaims she did to justify her continued incarceration and prosecution. Although the government\nhas dumped thousands of pages of irrelevant discovery from inapplicable time periods on Ms.\nMaxwell and her counsel, it refuses to provide the most basic information about the allegations\nin Counts One through Four: who, what, when, and hou. Because Counts One through Four of\nthe superseding indictment (“Indictment”) lack the basic factual information <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for Ms.\nMaxwell to prepare her defense, and the government refuses to provide any meaningful\ndiscovery, the Court should either dismiss these counts or direct the government to answer Ms.\nMaxwell’s requests for particularity.\n\nI. The Indictment Lacks the <span class=\"highlight\">Necessary</span> Specificity\n\nThe government atempts to justify some of the Indictment’s deficiencies, e.g., lack of\nnames and dates, through citation to obviously inapplicable cases.\n\n“First,” the government offers United States v. Stringer, 73o F.3d l2o, l24 (2d Cir.\n2ol3), for the proposition that “the use of pseudonyms to refer to minor victims of the charged\nconduct does not warrant dismissal of the indictment.” Resp. at l53. The government fails to\npoint out, houever, that Stringer was a fraud case in which the conduct was alleged to have\noccurred over a 7-month period. The indictment was brought within a few years, not decades, of\nthe alleged crime, and the identity of the two people whose names were used in connection with\nthe fraud “had been revealed in the documents disclosed by the government a year” before trial.\nId. at l23.\n\nUnited States v. Kidd, 386 F. Supp. 3d 364, 367 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9), is equally\nunpersuasive. Kidd was indicted in 2ol8 for crimes alleged to have occurred as late as 2ol8.\nThe case involved two alleged victims and the government produced sufficient discovery to\nobviate the need for a bill of particulars. /d. at 368, 37o.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3834\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003837.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page5of8\nThus, the court found: the indictment “contains dates ranges for each count, stretching from\napproximately four days to four months. These date ranges are well within the boundaries\npermited by the Second Circuit and other federal courts, and have been supplemented with\nadditional details provided by the Government. Id., at *4 (emphasis added).\n\nTo date, the only time the government has “supplemented” any information about the\naccusations is when it is atempting to excuse some failure.\n\nHere, the accusers have given statements to the government. Accuser-l gave a statement\nto the government in 2oo6. All three accusers have made claims against the Epstein Estate.\nPresumably, the Accusers had to tell the Estate when and where any alleged abuse by Epstein\noccurred. Accordingly, this is not a situation where children do not remember things. This is a\nsituation where the government has refused to provide basic <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> information in an atempt\nto prejudice Ms. Maxwell’s defense.\n\n“Third,” the indictment is not “clear” (Resp. at l55); it was purposely drafted to\nmaximize charges and minimize clarity. For example, the photograph of Ms. Maxwell in the\nindictment is not from the time-period alleged. The pictures of the various properties were not\nincluded for specificity, they were included to maximize pretrial prejudice. The indictment is\nfull of “weasel words” which are words the meaning of which are “malleable to a point where\nthey mean what the user wants them to mean in any given situation; they have no meaning of\ntheir oun.” Abstrax, Inc. v. Hewlet-Packard Co., No, 2:l4-CV-l58-JRG, 2ol4 WL 5677834, at\n*2 (E.D. Tex. Nov. 4, 2ol4). For example: “up to and including at least in or about,”\n“contributed,” “among other things,” “for example in some instances,” “certain victims,” and\n“groomed and/or abused at multiple locations including the follouing.” Ms. Maxwell is at a loss\nto understand what she is charged with and when it is alleged to have happened. She can guess at\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3837\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003838.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page6of8\nnames, but given the government’s recent harbinger of a superseding indictment, likely to\natempt to fix some of these problems, Ms. Maxwell is wasting time and money playing whack-\na-mole with this Indictment.\n\nII. This Indictment Does Not Satisfy Minimal Notice Requirements\n\nIn Hamling v. United States, 4l8 U.S. 87, ll7-l8 (l974), the United States Supreme\nCourt explained the circumstances in which an indictment simply seting forth the offense in the\nwords of the statute may not suffice:\n\nOur prior cases indicate that an indictment is sufficient if it, first, contains the\n\nelements of the offense charged and fairly informs a defendant of the\n\ncharge against which [s]he must defend, and, second, enables [her] to plead an\nacquital or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense. It is\ngenerally sufficient that an indictment set forth the offense in the words of the\nstatute itself, as long as those words of themselves fully, directly, and expressly,\nwithout any uncertainty or ambiguity, set forth all the elements <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to\nconstitute the offence intended to be punished. Undoubtedly the language of the\nstatute may be used in the general description of an offence, but it must be\naccompanied with such a statement of the facts and circumstances as will inform\n\nthe accused of the specific offence, coming under the general description, with\n\nwhich [she] is charged. (cleaned up).\n\nThe government has failed to provide an indictment that “directly,” “expressly,” and “without\nuncertainty or ambiguity” sets forth the allegations against her. The alleged facts are vague and\nillusory and no meaningful discovery has been provided. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell cannot\nadequately defend herself, in violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States\nConstitution.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nBecause Counts One through Four of the Indictment lack the basic factual information\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for Ms. Maxwell to prepare her defense, and the government refuses to provide any\nmeaningful discovery, the Court should either dismiss these counts or direct the government to\nanswer Ms. Maxwell’s requests for particularity.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3838\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003842.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l4 Filed o4/l9/2l Page2of3\nmust wear either (i) a properly fited disposable mask under a cloth mask, with the outer edges of\nthe inner mask pushed against the face, or (i) a properly fited FDA-authorized N95 or KN95\nmask.

The government’s modus operandi\ncan be summed up in two words: “willful blindness.”\n\nConsistent with its “willful blindness” policy, the government has intentionally and\nmethodically avoided obtaining substantial exculpatory evidence in the possession of third\nparties. By way of example, Alleged Victim 2 kept what she claimed was a contemporary\njournal of the events surrounding her meetings with Epstein. The “journal” does not mention\nMs. Maxwell and contains no reference to any alleged sexual misconduct. The absence of any\ncontemporaneous recording about Ms. Maxwell is pouerful evidence of innocence.\nImportantly, it is the whole journal that is significant—that there are references to other\ncontemporaneous events supplies context and detail about the paucity (or more accurately,\nabsence) of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement. When asked to produce the journal, the\ngovernment’s response was “we don’t have it.” The same is true about other physical\nevidence, including boots, photographs, and documents.\n\nAlthough all the alleged victims in this mater have monetized their claims against\nEpstein and others, including Ms. Maxwell, the government has failed to investigate those\nfinancial gains or the lawyers fomenting them and their oun self-interest in monetary\noutcomes. Again, this is pouerful evidence of innocence.\n\nThe government, singularly focused on obtaining a conviction at any cost, has\nabandoned fair play and the pursuit of justice. Accordingly, it is Ms. Maxwell who must use\nthe subpoena process to secure specific, <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>, relevant, and exculpatory evidence for a\nfair hearing on her motions and in presentation of her defense at trial. Ms. Maxwell’s Rule l7\nsubpoena is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to vindicate her constitutional right to present a defense.

NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nLast summer, the Court scheduled trial in this mater to commence on July l2, 2o2l. The\nGovernment filed an S2 Superseding Indictment on March 29, 2o2l. Dkt. No. l87. The new\nindictment alleges that the conspiracies charged in Counts l and 3 extended to 2oo4 (the Sl\ncharged through l997) and identifies a fourth alleged victim, Minor Victim-4. It also adds two\nnew charges: Count 5 of the S2 Indictment charges Maxwell with participating in a sex\ntrafficking conspiracy between 2ool and 2oo4, and Count 6 charges Maxwell with participating\nin the sex trafficking of a minor or aiding and abeting the same. Jd.\n\nSince the filing of the S2 indictment, the parties have argued in leters whether its\nadditional charges and extended timeframe necessitates an adjournment of the trial date. Dkt.\n\nNos. l92, l99, and 2o2. Maxwell has also indicated that she either is requesting or will request a\n\nrenewed bail hearing in light of the filing of the S2. In Maxwell’s most recent leter, she\n\nexpressly requests an adjournment of the scheduled July l2 trial date, though the scope of the\n\nrequest is unclear. Dkt. No. 2o2. The leter first argues that a 9o-day adjournment is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>.\n\nBut it also states that some of her defense counsel are not available between September and\n\nDecember 2o2l, implying that the request is in fact to adjourn until January 2o22. The\n\nGovernment opposes the request for adjournment and any request for a renewed bail hearing.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3865\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003868.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 22l Filed o4/2o/2l Page4of5\ndeadline to submit requests for jury selection dates in the third quarter of 2o2l is May l5.\nFollouing the submission of requests, the Clerk’s Office will assign jury selection dates\naccording to a protocol that has rules of priority. For example, criminal jury trials requesting a\nparticular jury selection date are given priority over civil jury trials requesting that same date.\nCriminal trials involving detained defendants are given priority over criminal trials in which\ndefendants are not detained pre-trial. Among detained defendants, cases that set trial dates prior\nto March l6, 2o2o get priority. For any detained defendants whose trial date was set after March\nl6, 2o2o, priority is based upon who has been detained the longest. Absent a grant of an\nadjournment, by May l5, the Court will request a jury selection date as close to July l2, 2o2l as\npossible. Once a jury selection date is assigned by the Clerk’s Office, that date is firm. As of\nnou, the parties should presume that trial will commence on a date close to July l2 (depending\non trial demand and the order of priority) and plan accordingly.\n\nWith this information in mind, the Court seeks confirmation and express clarification\nfrom defense counsel for three reasons. First, Maxwell’s request for an adjournment came\nbefore the Court ruled on the pending motions, including the Court’s granting of Maxwell’s\nrequest to sever the perjury counts. Trial on the non-perjury counts will proceed first, which will\nshorten preparations for and the length of trial on the non-perjury counts. Second, Maxwell’s\nrequest was ambiguous as to the length of adjournment being requested. As noted, the leter\nargued a 9o-day adjournment was <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> but also suggested that some number of her defense\ncounsel would not be available until January 2o22. And third, by this Order the Court denies\nMaxwell’s request for a renewed bail hearing. All of these factors may influence Maxwell’s\nadjournment request.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3868\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003879.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 223 Filed o4/2o/2l Page6of23\nNPA to be read more narrouly than the language provides, arguing that follouing the NPA’s\nplain language would contradict “common sense.” (Opp.' 8, l6.) But a non-prosecution\nagreement is not an ordinary contract. Federal prosecutors knou hou to draft clear limitations\non promises made to criminal defendants, and they have a unique obligation to do so. What\nstrains “common sense” is the notion that any reasonable prosecutor who intended the NPA to be\nread as the government contends would have omited the limitations and modifications the\ngovernment nou seeks—particularly when dealing with a defendant who sought to “resolve\nglobally” his criminal liability. NPA at 2. The Court should therefore decline the government’s\ninvitation to rewrite the NPA to its liking, should enforce the NPA as writen, and should grant\nMs. Maxwell’s Motion.\n\nIn the alternative, the Court should permit discovery and hold an evidentiary hearing to\ndetermine the parties’ intent with respect to the co-conspirator immunity provision. While Ms.\nMaxwell contends that the NPA unambiguously bars her prosecution here, and that neither\ndiscovery nor a hearing is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for the Court to grant this motion, the government’s\narguments regarding the NPA parties’ intent simply cannot be credited without the consideration\nof evidence. Because Ms. Maxwell, as a nonparty, has no personal knouledge regarding the\nparties’ intent and no access to relevant documents, she should be permited to take discovery in\nadvance of any hearing.\n\nl. The NPA Applies to Ms. Maxwell, and She Has Standing to Enforce It.\n\nThe NPA’s co-conspirator immunity provision forecloses “any criminal charges against\nany potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to” four named individuals.\nNPA at 5 (emphasis added). The phrase “potential co-conspirators of Epstein” obviously\nincludes Ms. Maxwell. As the opening statement of the Indictment makes clear: “The charges\n“Opp.” refers herein to the Government’s Omnibus Opposition to the Defendant’s Pre-Trial Motions.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3879\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003884.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document223 Filed o4/2o/2l Pagellof23\n\nIn sum, the Indictment itself establishes Ms. Maxwell as a “potential co-conspirator of\nEpstein,” and the clear weight of authority vests her with standing to enforce the co-conspirator\nimmunity provision as a third-party beneficiary.\n\nI. The Co-Conspirator Immunity Provision is Not Limited to the SDFL.\n\nMs. Maxwell demonstrated in her opening brief that the NPA, read as a whole, creates an\naffirmative appearance that the parties intended the co-conspirator immunity provision—unlike\nEpstein’s immunity provision—to apply outside the Southern District of Florida (“SDFL”). In\narguing that the NPA’s selective use of language limiting the scope of Epstein’s immunity\napplies to the entire NPA, the government inverts fundamental principles of contract law and\nasks the Court to read nonexistent limitations into the NPA. The government then, incredibly,\nproceeds to fault Ms. Maxwell—a nonparty to the NPA—for failing to possess and produce\nevidence regarding the parties’ intent in negotiating the agreement. While the text of the NPA,\nread using basic principles of contractual interpretation, unambiguously prohibits the\ngovernment from prosecuting Epstein’s potential co-conspirators in any district, to the extent that\nthe Court finds it <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to consider extrinsic evidence, that evidence is in the hands of the\ngovernment and Epstein’s atorneys—and thus Ms. Maxwell should be permited to obtain it\nthrough discovery.\n\nThe government argues that application of the co-conspirator immunity provision beyond\nthe SDFL is barred by United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam), in\nwhich the Second Circuit stated that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the United\nStates Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the\nagreement contemplates a broader restriction.” Jd. at 672.4 Ms. Maxwell’s opening brief\n“Contrary to the government’s suggestion, no court has held that an “affirmative[] appear[ance]” requires an explicit\n“promise to bind other districts.” See Opp. 4.

Litlefield, 84o F.2d l43, l49 (lst Cir. l988) (internal citations and\nquotations omited). That is not the case here. Moreover, the government cites no case where a\npurportedly false response in an unrelated civil deposition was admissible as a false exculpatory\nstatement in a criminal case. Accordingly, the Perjury Counts should be severed and tried\nseparately.*\n\nII. The Perjury Counts Must Be Severed to Prevent the Introduction of\n\nImproper, Highly Prejudicial, and Inadmissible Evidence.\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure l4(a), captioned “Relief from Prejudicial Joinder,”\nconfers upon a trial court the discretion to sever even properly joined counts if “justice requires.”\nThe rule provides, in pertinent part: “If the joinder of offenses ...in an indictment . . . appears\nto prejudice a defendant or the government, the court may order separate trials of counts . . . or\nprovide any other relief that justice requires.” Fed. R. Crim. P. l4(a).\n\nThere can be litle doubt that if the Perjury Counts are not severed, Ms. Maxwell will\nsuffer substantial prejudice. The government’s proof of the Mann Act Counts will come almost\nexclusively from the testimony of the three accusers, with litle or no independent documentary\ncorroboration. Adding the Perjury Counts, which involve allegations of sexual abuse by another\nalleged victim that are unrelated to the charged crimes, will create a significant risk that the jury\nwill impermissibly use the evidence introduced in connection with the Perjury Counts “to infer a\ncriminal disposition” on the part of Ms. Maxwell to commit the Mann Act violations, or might\n> Tt is highly unlikely that two trials would occur in this mater. Should the case proceed to trial on Counts\nl-4, only, a conviction would expose Ms. Maxwell to a significant term of imprisonment. Under the\nsentencing guidelines, the Court would be permited to consider any severed perjury counts under a\nnumber of theories including | grouping] or 2l U.S.C. § 3553(a). No second trial would be <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>. If\nMs. Maxwell were acquited, issue-preclusion would bar any second trial. See Yeager v. United States,\n557 U.S. llo, l2l-l22 (2oo9).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo39o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003909.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 224 Filed o4/2o/2l Pagel2ofl7\ne = The Giuffre v.

There is no proper purpose for the\nadmission of any of the alleged perjury which occurred decades after the charges in Counts l-4. Certainly,\nthe government has articulated none. Ms. Maxwell’s answers to the vague and objectionable questions\nselectively plucked from hundreds of pages of transcripts have no relevance to any material issue related\nto the Mann Act Counts.

The\nGovernment has also agreed to provide notice pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 4o4(b), a\nproposed witness list, Jencks Act material, and Giglio material 45 days in advance of trial. As a\nresult, the defense will receive many of these disclosures weeks in advance of when is typical for\ncriminal defendants in this District, thereby further ensuring ample time to prepare for trial.

Defense interviews are <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> because of the government’s continued\nrefusal to affirmatively investigate exculpatory evidence. Of the 3o2s reviewed by defense\ncounsel a pervasive tactic has emerged: as soon as the witness begins to provide information\nhelpful to the defense the interview is terminated by the government. Had the government asked\nlogical follou-up questions defense interviews might not be <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>.\n\nThe government has had years to investigate these allegations (dating decades ago, from\nl994-2oo4) using the enormous resources at its disposal, including multiple grand juries, scores\nof agents, and teams of prosecutors. It is unreasonable to expect that Ms. Maxwell’s lawyers can\nconduct a COVID-burdened review of 2o,ooo pages of interviews with 225 potential witnesses\nwhile preparing for a trial less than 9o days away.\n\nD. The new charges require additional defense investigation and preparation.\n\nDozens of the statements produced support Ms. Maxwell’s defense and will require\nfurther defense investigation. Defense investigation is a key component to providing effective\nassistance of counsel and the duty of counsel to diligently carry out this task is well established.\n“Defense counsel [have] a duty to investigate in all cases, and to determine whether there is a\nsufficient factual basis for criminal charges.”” ABA CRIMINAL JUSTICE STANDARDS FOR THE\nDEFENSE FUNCTION STANDARD 4-4.l, Duty to Investigate and Engage Investigators (4th Ed.\n2ol7).

And, again, the images\ncontain metadata that defense counsel must forensically analyze. Because defense counsel do not\neven have all of the images, this investigation cannot be accomplished in advance of the July l2,\n2o2l trial.\n\nF. The new charges and discovery require the assistance of defense experts\n\nIn addition to locating, investigating, and perhaps interviewing a significant number of\npotential witnesses, counsel also anticipate that the defense may require the specialized\nknouledge of expert witnesses to analyze evidence that is nou potentially relevant due to the\nexpanded time frame of the allegations. Ms. Maxwell anticipates that the “highly confidential\nhard drives” will need to be forensically examined by a computer specialist to determine actual\nfile creation dates, any alterations, and the original location of the data. Although the government\nhas not identified any trial exhibits, it seems probable that the services of various forensic\nexaminers may be <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to analyze the exhibits.\n\nMs. Maxwell will also need to receive and review the 2o,ooo pages of “new” material to\nprovide that information to potential defense experts for consideration. None of this can happen\nin time to make appropriate disclosures in advance of trial. See United States v. Santos, No. S 9l\nCR. 724 (CSH), l99l WL 248784 at *2 (S.D.N.Y.

Motions\n\nMs. Maxwell anticipates that the Court will need to resolve various discovery disputes\nrelating to the problems identified supra. In addition, Ms. Maxwell needs additional time to\nsupplement her previously filed motions and file additional F. R. Crim. P l2 motions relating to\nthe second superseding indictment. After reviewing the “new” discovery, Ms. Maxwell\nanticipates that she will file motions in limine related to the government’s alleged FRE 4o4(b)\nevidence and the government’s proposed exhibits, FRE 7o2 challenges to purported expert\ntestimony, and motions concerning jury selection and change of venue. In addition, expert\ndisclosure may necessitate a Daubert hearing.\n\nBecause Ms. Maxwell has not yet had sufficient time to review and investigate the “new”\ndiscovery and has had insufficient access to existing discovery she is unable to predict precisely\nwhat additional evidentiary motions will be required. The late-filed superseding indictment along\nwith the late disclosure of Brady material and failure to provide the discovery to Ms. Maxwell\nhave delayed defense trial preparation and will continue to interfere with various tasks that\nwould normally be in process at this stage of the proceedings.

Requests l through\n5 of the subpoena thus fail Nixon’s specificity requirement.\n3 The Defendant contends that Requests l through 5 are similar to those approved by the\ncourt in United States v.

The defendant then submited a new set of requests that, unlike the Requests at\nissue here, limited the request to communications between a certain, specified set of individuals\nand narrou time periods of approximately a year or less. /d.

On the specificity prong alone, Requests | through 5 fail to satisfy\nthe Nixon standard.\n\nRequests l and 2 fail for the separate reason that, if Maxwell is entitled to the materials\nsought at all, they should come from the Government. Requests l, 2, and 8 all seek documents\nthat are procurable from the Government. As noted above, Requests l and 2 seek\ncommunications between BSF and government officials regarding a certain subject, from 2ol5\nto the date of the subpoena. Request 8, meanwhile, refers to a specific grand jury subpoena that\nthe Government issued to BSF. As to all of these requests, Maxwell asserts that the Rule l7(c)\nsubpoena is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to fix what she deems to be the Government’s failure to comply with its\ndiscovery obligations. Among the principles set forth in Nixon is that the materials must not be\notherwise procurable reasonably in advance of trial by exercise of due diligence. Nixon, 4l8\nU.S. at 699. These three requests target information that reasonably can be expected to be in the\nhands of the Government. To the extent that Maxwell has a basis to argue that the Government\nhas not met its discovery obligations, the Rule l7(c) subpoena process is not the proper\nmechanism for pursuing that. Rather, with notice to the Government so that the issue is properly\njoined, Maxwell must make some shouing of that failure and seek specific and appropriate relief\nfrom this Court.\n\nRequests 6 and 7 seek contingency fee agreements or engagement leters between BSF\nand two of its clients who are alleged victims. Maxwell has failed to make the required shouing\nunder Nixon that these records would be relevant or admissible for purposes of her Rule l7(c)\napplication. The only plausible theory of relevance set forth in Maxwell’s papers is that these\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4o42\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004043.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 252 Filed o4/27/2l Page5of9\ndocuments are <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for purposes of impeachment. But as a general mater, the need to\nimpeach witnesses generally “is insufficient to require [materials’] production in advance of\ntrial.” Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 7ol. Many courts have held that impeachment material does not\nbecome relevant until after the witness testifies. United States v. Skelos, No. l5-CR-3l7\n(KMW), 2ol8 WL 2254538, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.

See also\nAvenati, 2o2o WL 86768, at *6 (rejecting the argument that the defendant needed the recordings\nin question prior to trial in order “to demonstrate witnesses’ bias or self-interest.”). The\narguments as to relevance are otherwise specious, and the Court cannot discern what relevance\nthe materials responsive to Requests 6 and 7 may have. In any event, there is litle risk that\nreview of these materials, if they become relevant and admissible, will lead to a delay at trial,\ngiven their limited volume. United States v. Seabrook, No. l6-CR-467, 2ol7 WL 48383ll, at *2\n(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 23, 2ol7). For documents that may ripen into relevance if and when the BSF\nclients testify, Maxwell presumably could request that the Court issue a subpoena to require\nproduction of the engagement leters to the Court so that the information can be made available\nto Maxwell, if appropriate, at the conclusion of each witness’s direct testimony. See United\nStates v. Giampa, No. S 92-CR-437 (PKL), l992 WL 29644o, at *3-*4 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 7, l992);\nUnited States v. Ferguson, No. 3:o6-CR-l37 (CFD), 2oo7 WL 45773o3, at *3 (D. Conn. Dec.\n26, 2oo7).\n\nMaxwell also argues that compulsion of the materials’ production under Rule l7(c) is\njustified because the materials appear not to have been produced by BSF in response to the grand\n5\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o43\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004082.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 266 Filed o5/o3/2l Page2of3\nthat the conspiracies charged in Counts l and 3 extended to 2oo4 (the Sl charged through l997),\nidentifying a fourth alleged victim, Minor Victim-4. It also adds two new charges: Count 5 of\nthe S2 Indictment charges Maxwell with participating in a sex trafficking conspiracy between\n2ool and 2oo4, and Count 6 charges Maxwell with participating in the sex trafficking of a minor\nor aiding and abeting the same. Dkt. No. l87. These additions will require the defense to (l)\nreview a substantial amount of discovery that is nou potentially relevant as a result of the S2\nIndictment; (2) re-review discovery that it had previously considered in light of the changes to\nthe case against her; (3) conduct new investigations based on the new charges, including\npotential interviews of new witnesses; and (4) re-evaluate her trial preparation and strategy.\nSecond, although jury trials have resumed in the district and conditions in MDC and around the\ncountry are improving, the defendant’s and defense counsel’s preparation efforts to date have\nbeen and to some extent continue to be hampered by the effects of the COVID-l9 pandemic. As\nthe Government indicated in explaining the delay in filing the new charges, travel constraints and\nother safety concerns resulting from the pandemic have sloued trial preparation and complicated\nthe logistics of conducting investigations. See Dkt. No. l99 at 2. Third, defense counsel must\nbalance preparing for trial with considering and preparing any supplemental pre-trial motions in\nresponse to the new charges contained in the S2 Indictment. Although the perjury counts were\nrecently severed, the Court cannot conclude that this sufficiently offsets the additional burdens\nplaced on the defense as a result of the new charges and expanded timeframe resulting from the\nS2 indictment.\n\nThe Court is very mindful of the countervailing considerations that require that any\nadjournment be no longer than <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>. For one, the Defendant, whose counsel strenuously\nrequest the adjournment, is detained pre-trial. Moreover, with many lawyers on both sides of\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o82\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004083.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 266 Filed o5/o3/2l Page3of3\nthis case, any adjournment runs the risk of precluding some atorneys from being able to\nparticipate and/or requiring them to seek adjustments to schedules in other maters. And,\nimportantly, any victims and the public more broadly have a strong interest in trial proceeding\nwithout undue delay. It is the Court’s obligation to ensure that the case proceed to that trial as\nexpeditiously as possible, taking into account the interests of justice and all relevant\ncircumstances. See l8 U.S.C. §3l6l(h)(7)(A); l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(7).\n\nHaving balanced all of the factors outlined above, the Court concludes that the interests\nof justice justify granting a short continuance. The Court deems an adjournment until fall 2o2l\nto be reasonable. Such an adjournment would plainly give the defense team sufficient time to\nprepare for trial in light of the additional charges contained in the S2 indictment while also\nensuring that the trial proceeds without undue delay.

P. 26.2 disclosures are set forth belou.\nMs. Maxwell’s Position\nMs. Maxwell does not agree with the government’s proposal that she submit witness\nstatements pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 26.2 at least four weeks in advance of\ntrial. No statute or rule requires disclosure of either non-expert witness lists or Rule 26.2\nmaterial in advance of trial. Furthermore, the defense has not been given any specific dates\nrelated to any alleged illegal activity nor has the government disclosed the actual identity of any\nalleged victim or witness. Accordingly, it is impossible to identify any affirmative witness who\nmight, for example, place Ms. Maxwell in a different location at a specific date and time. Until\nthe government completes the presentation of its evidence at trial, the defendant will not be able\nto identify definitively witnesses that may be relevant or <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>.

Nathan\nMay 3, 2o2l\nPage 4\nI. The Defense Does Not — and Need Not - Yet Intend to Call Any Particular Witness.\n\nUnlike Rule l6(b)(l), the Jencks Act and Rule 26.2 do not obligate the defense to\nreciprocate the government’s early disclosures with early disclosures of its oun. If the\ngovernment discloses Jencks Act material early, the defense is not obligated to act in kind. See\nUnited States v. Martin, No. CR o7-l2o5 (A) CBM, 2oo9 WL 453l95, at *2 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 2o,\n2oo9) (denying government’s motion to compel reciprocal Jencks Act discovery from defense).\nThere is good reason for not mandating such reciprocity: the government and the defendant are\nnot similarly situated.\n\nMs. Maxwell has the right to a presumption of innocence. Estelle v. Williams, 425 U.S.\n5ol, 5o3 (l976). The burden to prove guilt is high, and it is entirely the government’s to bear.\n“T]he Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a\nreasonable doubt of every fact <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to constitute the crime with which he is charged.” Jn re\nWinship, 397 U.S. 358, 364 (l97o). In result, the defense is not obligated in any way to put on\nevidence at trial, including witnesses. Nevertheless, Ms. Maxwell has rights to a present a\ndefense and to compulsory process of witnesses. U.S. CONST. amend. VI; Washington v. Texas,\n388 U.S. l4, l8 (l967).\n\nBecause all defense witnesses are prospective, defense considerations regarding trial\nstrategy with respect to these decisions are protected by atorney-client privilege and the work\nproduct doctrine. “Although the work-product doctrine most frequently is asserted as a bar to\ndiscovery in civil litigation, its role in assuring the proper functioning of the criminal justice\nsystem is even more vital.” United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225, 238 (l975). See also\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 686 (l984) (“Government violates the right to effective\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o87\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004089.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 267 _ Filed o5/o3/2l Page 6of7\nThe Hon. Alison J. Nathan\nMay 3, 2o2l\nPage 6\nF.3d at l45—46. Nor do the procedural and statutory rules affect the defense’s right to Brady\ninformation prior to trial. See Docket No. 68 (“The Government shall disclose [Brady]\ninformation to the defense promptly after its existence becomes knoun to the Government so\nthat the defense may make effective use of the information in the preparation of its case.”);\naccord Fed. R. Crim. P. 5(f); United States v. Rodriguez, 496 F.3d 22l, 226 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (“the\nGovernment must make disclosures in sufficient time that the defendant will have a reasonable\nopportunity to act upon the information efficaciously”).\n\nIn sum, Ms. Maxwell will be able to identify any relevant defense witnesses and exhibits\nthat she may need to introduce in a defense case only after the government concludes the\npresentation of its evidence at trial. Evidence may, or may not, be <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> after the government\nconcludes its case-in-chief. Ms. Maxwell’s proposal is reasonable and will avoid any\nunnecessary trial delays because it is unlikely that any Rule 26.2 statements not already in the\npossession of the government, if they exist, will be voluminous or complicated.\n\nGovernment’s Position\n\nConsistent with the position set forth in its April 2l, 2o2l leter to the Court, the\nGovernment proposes that defense counsel provide a proposed witness list and witness\nstatements pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 26.l four weeks in advance of trial.\nSuch a production schedule would be consistent with the Government's agreement to provide\nJencks Act material seven weeks in advance of trial, which is significantly before the\nGovernment is obligated to produce such material under the relevant statute. Production in\nadvance of trial will also ensure adequate time for the Government to file any relevant motions\nand to prepare any rebutal case as appropriate. The defense proposal to delay production of\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o89\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004099.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 269 Filed o5/o4/2l Page6eof9\nPage 6\n\nSecond, the request in insufficiently specific. To satisfy the specificity prong, a Rule l7(c)\nsubpoena must be able to “reasonably specify the information contained or believed to be\ncontained in the documents sought rather than merely hop[e] that something useful will turn up.”\nBarnes, 2oo8 WL 9359654, at *4 (alteration and internal quotation marks omited); see, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Avenati, No. l9 Cr. 373 (PGG), 2o2o WL 5o8682, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 3l, 2o2o).\nThe defendant’s request for the entire diary is likely to sweep in a significant period of Minor\nVictim-2’s life before Minor Victim-2 met Epstein or the defendant—all of which is irrelevant.\n\nTo justify this overbreadth, the defendant identifies two reasons she needs to review the\ndiary in full: to demonstrate the absence of references to the defendant, and to establish the diary’s\nauthenticity. (4/2/2l Leter from Def., Dkt. No. 244 at 9). As to the former, there is no probative\nvalue in shouing that diary entries before the defendant had ever met Epstein or the defendant\ncontain no references to Epstein or the defendant, and in any event, the Government has conceded\nthe point. As to the later, the defendant offers only the conclusory statement that review of the\nentire diary is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>. That is insufficient, as explained above.\n\nThird, the request is barred by Rule l7(h). That section prohibits the use of Rule l7 to\n“subpoena a statement of a witness or of a prospective witness,” Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(h), explaining\nthat such issues are governed by Rule 26.2. The diary is a set of recorded statements by Minor\nVictim-2. To the extent it should be produced, that production is governed by Rule l6, Rule 26.2,\nBrady, and Giglio, but not Rule l7. See, e.g., United States v. Carton, l7 Cr. 68o (CM), 2ol8 WL\n58l8lo7, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l9, 2ol8) (rejecting a request for a personnel file because the\nBSF, Dkt. No. l9l at 5 (“The Defendant also clearly seeks to use the journal for impeachment\npurposes, as highlighted in a prior filing in a recently dismissed civil action Ms. Farmer filed\nagainst the Defendant.”)). But as the Court has recently explained, Rule l7 is not a tool to obtain\nimpeachment material in advance of trial.

We have provided all the details concerning those conflicts and sought, as the Court\ndirected, to move other conflicting dates. Considering Ms. Maxwell’s extended period of\ndetention, and its deleterious effect on her health and well-being, we cannot agree to a date far\nbeyond November 8\".\n\nIn response to our efforts to meet and confer, the only date the government offered was\nNovember 29\". When asked to explain with details similar to those conveyed by defense\ncounsel, the government replied at 6:oo p.m. this evening simply that November 29\" was\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to provide \"continuity of counsel and the potential unavailability of a trial witness.\"\nThe government failed to disclose which counsel needed to continue on the case, nor the\n\"potential unavailability” of which trial witness. There was no meaningful conferral. Previously,\nof course, the government took the position that its accusers wanted the soonest possible trial\ndate.\n\nThe government’s requests to defer the trial from November 8\" to a November 29\" start\ndate rest on faulty premises. First, they contend, “continuity of counsel” is needed so that one of\nthe four assigned Assistant U.S. Atorneys can be available to try this case. In the initial stages of\nour review of the 2o,ooo plus pages of non-testifying witness statements, is clear that two of the\nother assigned AUSAs have been involved from the very beginning of this investigation and\nhave actively participated in all of the interviews together. They were joined as often as not by\nyet a fourth AUSA who previously was assigned to this case and who still works in their office.\nNotably the government does not claim that the three remaining assistants are unfamiliar with the\nfacts or law of the case, nor that they are not competent trial counsel.\n\nSecond, the government points to a “potential” conflict of one witness who reportedly is\nunavailable (for unknoun reasons) for nearly two months — all of October through to\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4ll8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004121.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document277 Filed o5/ll/2l Pagelof2\nUSDCSDNY\nDOCUMENT\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK DATE FILED: 5/ll/2l ‘II\nUnited States of America,\n_y—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\nThe Court has considered the parties’ proposals regarding the commencement of trial.\nDkt. Nos. 275, 276. For the reasons stated in the Government’s leter, the Court will request\nNovember 29, 2o2l from the Clerk’s Office as the trial start date—that is the date (pending\napproval from the Clerk’s Office consistent with the SDNY COVID protocols) that opening\nstatements will be made to the jury. Houever, the Court will also request from the Clerk’s\nOffice that jury selection occur during the week of November l5. Counsel shall plan\naccordingly.\nThe Court grants the Government’s motion to exclude time until November 29, 2o2l.\nThe Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial\ncomputations for the period from today’s date through November 29, 2o2l, outweigh the\ninterests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to\npermit the defense to continue to review discovery and other materials in light of the superseding\nindictment; to permit the parties to prepare and file motions in /imine; to permit the parties to\nmake and review additional pretrial disclosures; and to allou adequate time for the parties to\nprepare for trial.

The MDC has determined that these factors necessitate more\nfrequent safety and security checks. The Government also indicates that the prohibition on eye\nmasks is a generally applicable policy, but that Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other non-\ncontraband items to cover her eyes.\n\nTo the extent that Maxwell’s April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override BOP’s\ndetermination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check procedures, that\nrequest is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported. Certainly nothing in the\nrecord plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere with Maxwell’s ability to prepare for\nher trial and communicate with her lawyers. Defense counsel’s May 7, 2o2l leter, Dkt. No.\n272, describes generalized grievances but makes no additional specific and supported application\nfor relief. Nevertheless, the Court urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pre-\ntrial detainees can be reduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to\ncontinue to ensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP\ndetermines are <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,\nand consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees.\n\nThe Government shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel\nfor the MDC.\n\nSO ORDERED.

Delaware, 438 U.S. l54 (l978) in\norder to obtain relief. But even if Franks applies, Maxwell has easily met her burden. To obtain a\nFranks hearing, a defendant must make a “substantial preliminary shouing,” United States v.\nFalso, 544 F.3d llo, l25 (2d Cir. 2oo8) (quoting Franks, 438 U.S. at l55-56), that (l) there were\n“iaccuracies or omissions” in the affidavit, (il) “the alleged falsehoods or omissions were\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to the issuing judge’s probable cause or necessity finding,” and (ll) “the claimed\ninaccuracies or omissions [were] the result of the affiant’s deliberate falsehood or reckless\ndisregard for the truth.” United States v. Lambus, 897 F.3d 368, 397 (2d Cir. 2ol8). Here, there\nis no dispute that (l) AUSA |g representations to Judge McMahon were false and\nmisleading, (i) Judge McMahon would not have modified the Protective Order to authorize the\nsubpoena if AUSA gg had been honest with her, and (3) AUSA gg statements\nwere deliberately false, since he had a “complete handle on the landscape” months before he\nappeared in front of and misled Judge McMahon.\n\nNor need Maxwell prove “outrageous government conduct” to obtain relief. Were that\nher burden, houever, Maxwell would have easily satisfied it. “The concept of fairness embodied\nin the Fifth Amendment due process guarantee is violated by government action that is\nfundamentally unfair or shocking to our traditional sense of Justice.” United States v. Schmidt,\nlo5 F.3d 82, 9l (2d Cir. l997). To prevail on an outrageous government conduct claim, “a\ndefendant must shou that the government's conduct is ‘so outrageous that common notions of\nfairness and decency would be offended were judicial processes invoked to obtain a\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4l63\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004221.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 286 Filed o5/2o/2l Page8ofl4\n\nThe government also improperly stretches the scope of the alleged conspiracies in a\nfailing atempt to make its allegations regarding Accuser-3 fit within those charges. For\nexample, the government asserts that Ms. Maxwell’s alleged role in purported lawful sexual\nactivity involving Epstein and Accuser-3 in England is “evidence of the defendant’s agreements\nwith Epstein to identify minor girls to entice and transport for purposes of illegal sex acts.”\n(Opp. l62.) But the Indictment does not allege that Ms. Maxwell conspired with Epstein to\n“entice” minor girls to commit illegal sex acts, let alone to “identify minor girls” for such an\nenticement. Nor could it, since mere “enticement” to commit illegal sex acts is insufficient to\nestablish a Mann Act violation. The alleged conspiracies were conspiracies to entice or cause\nminors to travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sex acts, and the Indictment does not allege\nthat Accuser-3 ever traveled or engaged in illegal sex acts.\n\nThe government commits a similar Freudian slip in its atempt to distinguish United\nStates v. Hsia, 24 F. Supp. 2d l4 (D.D.C. l998), when it states that “the allegations regarding\n[Accuser-3] involve conduct that falls within the heartland of the conspiracy: grooming a minor\ngirl to engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein.” Opp. l64 n.59. The “heartland of the\nconspiracy” is actual or contemplated interstate travel of minor girls to engage in unlawful\nsexual acts with Epstein, which the government cannot establish with respect to Accuser-3. The\ngovernment’s opposition repeatedly treats interstate travel, the linchpin of federal court\nJurisdiction over the alleged conduct and the <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> object of the conspiracies alleged, as a\nthrouaway element of its case.\n\nIn short, neither the allegations regarding Accuser-3 nor the government’s proffer\nestablish an intent that Accuser-3 (i) engage in “illegal sex acts” or (ll) travel while a minor.

A bill of particulars is therefore <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to\nprevent unfair surprise at trial and to allou Ms. Maxwell to adequately prepare her defense.\n\nIt is also critical that Ms. Maxwell receive accelerated disclosure of the government’s\nwitness list, Jencks Act material, Brady/Giglio material, Rule 4o4(b) evidence, and any co-\nconspirator statements. The government predictably argues that there is nothing unusual about\nthe circumstances of Ms. Maxwell’s case that would justify a deviation from customary\nproduction deadlines for the materials she requests. But Ms. Maxwell’s case is not a typical case\nand presents unique circumstances that warrant the relief she seeks. The Indictment alleges\nvague conduct that is over 25 years old and involves conduct that allegedly took place over a\nfour-year period in multiple locations across the country and in at least one foreign jurisdiction.\nAny relevant documents that may still exist will take time to retrieve. The investigation of\nwitness statements and any Rule 4o4(b) evidence will similarly take significant time and\npotentially also involve foreign travel and depositions under Rule l5 of the Federal Rules of\nCriminal Procedure. For these reasons, and the others set forth belou, the Court should order the\nproduction of these materials by March 22, 2o2l.\n\nMs. Maxwell has also provided specific reasons supporting her requests for the\nproduction and inspection of certain FBI reports and other documents, such as a complete copy\nof the handwriten diary, which are not included in the discovery. There is ample evidence to\nconclude that these documents contain material inconsistencies in the prior statements of key\ngovernment witnesses, as well as other exculpatory information for Ms. Maxwell. The Court\nshould therefore order the government to produce them.\n\n° Ms. Maxwell originally requested that the government produce the requested witness materials by March l2, 2o2l\n(Dkt. l48 at l5, l7), the same deadline as the Court imposed on the government to produce documents related to\ncertain non-testifying witnesses. (Dkt. 73). Because the Court granted Ms. Maxwell’s request to extend the filing\ndeadline for the reply motions by lo days from March 5, 2o2l to March l5, 2o2l, we have moved forward our\nrequested deadline for the production of witness materials by lo days to March 22, 2o2l.\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4232\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004236.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 287 Filed o5/2o/2l Page 9ofl6\nMaxwell cannot effectively prepare her defense and will be at risk of further “surprise”\nallegations on the eve of trial. See Bortnovsky, 82o F.2d at 575 (bill of particulars <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to\nprevent the government from proceeding “furtively’”).\n\nMoreover, as discussed more fully in the Surplusage Reply, these new allegations\nrepresent an impermissible atempt by the government to broaden the scope of the alleged\nconspiracies and bolster its thin case with testimony that is irrelevant to the charged crimes.\nAccordingly, a bill of particulars is not only <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> so that Ms. Maxwell can adequately\nprepare her defense, but also so that the government cannot use evidence that is outside the scope\nof the charged conspiracies to prove its case. See United States v. Hsia, 24 F. Supp. 2d l4, 33\n(D.D.C. l998) (ordering a bill of particulars “as to the scope of the alleged conspiratorial\nagreement” and whether and hou certain allegations “were within the scope of the conspiracy\ncharged”).4\nI. The Court Should Grant Ms. Maxwell’s Request for Accelerated Disclosure of the\n\nGovernment’s Witness List, Jencks Act Material, Brady/Giglio Material, Rule\n\n4o4(b) Material, and Co-Conspirator Statements.\n\nAs set forth in Ms. Maxwell’s opening brief, her case presents special circumstances and\nunique investigative challenges that justify accelerated disclosure of the identities of the\ngovernment’s witnesses, their prior statements and impeachment material, any expected Rule\n4o4(b) evidence, and any potential co-conspirator statements. (Dkt. l48 at l4-l5). In response,\nthe government does not atempt to rebut Ms. Maxwell’s justifications for accelerated disclosure\nof these materials. Instead, it offers a formulaic argument that Ms. Maxwell’s case is no\ndifferent than other recent high-profile trials in this District, that she has not made a sufficient\n“It is telling that these new allegations are surfacing for the first time in the government’s opposition.

(Opp. l84-85, l88-93). But Ms. Maxwell’s case is different—emphatically so—\nand the deadlines the government proposes are not sufficient to allou Ms. Maxwell, who is\nincarcerated, to adequately prepare her defense.\n\nMs. Maxwell has made a specific shouing that early disclosure of the identities of the\ngovernment’s witnesses is “both material to the preparation of [her] defense and reasonable in\nlight of the circumstances surrounding [her] case.” Cannone, 528 F.2d at 3oo-ol. First, the\nallegations are over 25 years old and any documentary records that witnesses may direct us to, if\nthey still exist, will be hard to retrieve and take time to collect. Second, the conduct relevant to\nthe charged crimes allegedly took place in three different locations across the country (New\nYork, Florida, and New Mexico) and in at least one foreign jurisdiction (London, England) over\na four-year period. Hence, it will take time to investigate any witness statements pertaining to\nthe alleged conduct, as well as to identify and interview other witnesses who may contradict the\ngovernment’s witnesses. See United States v. Rueb, No. oo-CR-9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at\n*8-*9 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, 2ool) (disclosure ordered where evidence located in multiple locations\nand offenses spanned three-year “extended period of time”). In particular, international travel\nmay be <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to investigate statements by witnesses located in England or other foreign\njurisdictions, as will depositions pursuant to Rule l5 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\nSee United States v. Savin, No. oo-CR-45 (RWS), 2ool WL 243533, *7-*9 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 7,\n2ool) (disclosure ordered where offenses spanned “extended” six-year period and involved\npotential depositions of foreign witnesses). Third, for each witness identified, the defense will\nneed to search through the over 2.7 million pages of discovery to identify any relevant\ndocuments for cross-examination. The task is extraordinarily difficult and time-consuming, as\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4237\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004239.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 287 Filed o5/2o/2l Page l2 of l6\n\nFinally, the government’s offer to provide Jencks Act and Giglio information for its\ntestifying witnesses “as much as four weeks” before trial is insufficient. (Opp. l84). Certain of\nthe Accusers and (we suspect) many of the government’s anticipated witnesses have made\nnumerous statements about the events in question, either in the context of civil litigation, or to\nthe media, or in other public fora. The defense will have to carefully analyze and compare any\nprior statements or impeachment material that the government discloses against the witness’s\nnumerous public statements. This process will be time-consuming, but essential to Ms.\nMaxwell’s preparation for trial.°\n\nThe Court has already acknouledged that the defense will need substantial time to\nevaluate and investigate materials related to potential witnesses in this case, and has ordered the\ngovernment, over its objection, to produce certain Rule l6 materials related to non-testifying\nwitnesses by March l2, 2o2l—four months in advance of trial—“‘to ensure that the defense can\nadequately prepare for trial.” (Dkt. 73).

(Dkt. 2o7 at 9-l3). Ms. Maxwell nevertheless preserves her argument and reasserts\nit with respect to Counts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment.\n\nAs it existed in 2oo4, the federal sex trafficking statute, l8 U.S.C. § l59l, charged in\nCounts Five and Six of the $2 Indictment provided that “[w]hoever knouingly ... recruits,\nentices, harbors, transports, provides, or obtains by any means a person ... knouing that ... the\nperson has not atained the age of l8 years and will be caused to engage in a commercial sex act”\nis guilty of acrime.” l8 U.S.C. § l59l(a) (2oo4). Because the statute uses the phrase “will be\ncaused” before the phrase “to engage in a commercial sex act,” it is not <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for the\ncommercial sex act to take place for the crime to be complete. See United States v. Garcia-\nGonzalez, 7l4 F.3d 3o6, 3l2 (5\" Cir. 2ol3) (“The future verb tense of the phrase ‘will be\ncaused’—which precedes ‘to engage in a commercial sex act’”—indicates that a sex act does not\nhave to occur to satisfy the elements of the child-sex-trafficking offense.”). For the reasons\nalready set forth in Ms. Maxwell’s previous motion, the statute of limitations in l8 U.S.C. §\n3283 does not govern l8 U.S.C. § l59l because the offense does not “necessarily entail” the\nsexual abuse of a minor and therefore is not an “offense involving” such conduct. Counts Five\nand Six must therefore be dismissed.\n\nIV. The Court Should Dismiss Count Five and Either Count One or Count Three as\n\nMultiplicitous.\n\nCount Five must also be dismissed along with either Count One or Count Three as\nmultiplicitous. In her previous motions, Ms. Maxwell argued that the Court should dismiss\neither Count One or Count Three of the $l Indictment as multiplicitous because they charged the\nsame conspiracy under l8 U.S.C. § 37l. (Dkt. l22, 2lo). Count Five of the S2 Indictment\ncharges Ms. Maxwell with yet another § 37l conspiracy from 2ool-2oo4 based on the\nallegations of Accuser-4. (S2 Indictment 9 22-25). These same allegations are fully\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo429o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004292.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document293 Filed o5/25/2l Page 27 of 32\ntime period from 2ool-2oo4. The counts do not specify, houever, the dates that any of this\nalleged conduct occurred. For example, the S2 Indictment does not specify when Ms. Maxwell\n“interacted” with Accuser-4 or allegedly “recruited” her “to engage in sex acts with Epstein” or\n“enticed” her “to recruit other girls to engage in paid sex acts with Epstein.” (S2 Indictment J\n9d, 25a, 25b). Nor does the S2 Indictment specify when Ms. Maxwell allegedly paid Accuser-4\nor sent her gifts or called her to schedule massage appointments. (Id. ff 9d, 25c, 25d). A Bill of\nParticulars for Counts Five and Six is therefore <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> and appropriate. See Bortnovsky, 82o\nF.2d at 575 (Bill of Particulars warranted where “[t]he relevance of key events was shrouded in\nmystery at the commencement of and throughout the trial”). /d. at 575.\n\nFurthermore, as discussed above, Ms. Maxwell has already credibly asserted that her\nprosecution on Counts Five and Six is barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause. (See Section II\nsupra). In order “to interpose [her] plea of double jeopardy,” Ms. Maxwell must confirm what is\napparent from the grand jury testimony of Special Agen i — that the offenses charged\nin Counts Five and Six are the same offenses that were presented to the SDFL grand jury.\n\nAccordingly, for these reasons and the reasons already discussed in our previous motion\nfor a Bill of Particulars, the Court should order the government to file a Bill of Particulars\nidentifying the follouing information related to Counts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment:\n\n(l) The dates when Ms. Maxwell allegedly met and/or interacted with\n\nAccuser-4.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.® Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\ni In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\n8 OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nvil\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004308.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll of 349\ninvestigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.? OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\na 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstetn’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation imto those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR- oooo43o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004309.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l2 of 349\n\nof immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens. The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\n\nIx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004312.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l5 of 349\nthat the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the\nDepartment.\n\nVI. ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004343.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 46 of 349\nEpstein massages that were sexual in nature, and that Epstein had used “various types of pressure”\nto avoid prosecution by the state, including hiring atorneys who had personal connections to the\nState Atorney. Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about . . . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get .. . a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” In a later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“sreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004354.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 57 of 349\nhe is comfortable before proceeding.” Menchel told Villafafia he had “trouble understanding” why\nshe was in a “rush” “given hou long this case has been pending.”\n\nOPR questioned Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta about the timeline for reviewing\nthe prosecution memorandum and the proposed charges. Acosta and Menchel believed Villafafia’s\ntimeline was unrealistic from the start. Acosta told OPR that Villafafia was “very hard charging,”\nbut her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.” Menchel described Villafafia\nas “out over her skis a litle bit” and “ahead of” Acosta in terms of his analysis of the case.*\nMenchel said it was clear to him that Acosta “was going to be the one making the call” about\nwhether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision. Menchel\ntold OPR, “This [was] not a case [we were] going to review in two weeks and make a decision\non.” Sloman told OPR that although he did not conduct a “granular review” of the proposed\ncharges, he believed Menchel and Lourie had done so and “obviously” had concluded that “the\nfacts and the law didn’t suggest that the right thing to do was to automatically indict.” Lourie told\nOPR that he believed “the case was moving ahead.”\n\nVillafafia continued to seek direction from her managers. On May l5, 2oo7, she emailed\nSloman, noting that “[i]t seemed from our discussion yesterday that pestering Alex [Acosta] will\nnot do any good. Am I right about that?” Sloman responded, “Yes.” On May 2l, 2oo7, three\nweeks after submiting the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia emailed Sloman and Menchel\nasking for “a sense of the direction where we are headed-i.e., approval of an indictment something\nlike the current draft, a complaint to allou for pre-indictment negotiations, an indictment\ndrastically different from the current draft?” Sloman responded only, “Taken care of.”*°\n\nD. Defense Counsel Seek a Meeting with Senior USAO Managers, which\n\nVillafatia Opposes\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein’s defense counsel continued to seek additional information about the\nfederal investigation and a meeting with senior USAO managers, including Acosta. In a May lo,\n2oo7 email to Menchel, Lourie reported that Epstein’s atorneys “want me to tell them the statutes\na Villafafia explained to OPR that the “rush” related to her concern that Epstein was continuing to abuse girls:\n“Tn terms of the issue of why the hurry, because child sex offenders don’t stop until they’re behind bars. That was our\ntime concern.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia offering this explanation to him. OPR\nnotes that in their respective statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafafia\nexpressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events. When it was <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for OPR to resolve those\nconflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the extensive documentary record and the\ntestimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.\n\na Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafafia was “ahead of where the office was internally” and\nthat caused “discontent” between Villafafia and Menchel. Villafafia was not the only one, houever, who was surprised\nthat the indictment was not approved immediately. The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed”\nafter Villafafia submited the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum touards an indictment abated. Villafafia’s\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case prosecuted.”\nHouever, Menchel rebuked Villafafia in his July 5, 2oo7 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing\ncharges in] this mater was a foregone conclusion.”\n\n46 Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he\nhad spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4354\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004357.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 6o of 349\n\nfor meetings was to cause delay, but “the people in my office either couldn’t see that or didn’t\nwant to see that,” perhaps because of “their lack of experience with these types of cases” or a\nmisguided belief “that [Epstein’s] atorneys would not engage in this behavior.” Villafafia told\nOPR that she “could not seem to get [her supervisors] to understand the seriousness of Epstein’s\nbehavior and the fact that he was probably continuing to commit the behavior, and that there was\na need to move with <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> speed.” Nonetheless, Villafafia folloued the guidance of her\nimmediate supervisor and did not send the email.\n\nLike Lourie, Menchel told OPR that he believed meeting with defense counsel was good\npractice. Menchel told OPR that he saw “no dounside” to hearing the defense point of view.\nDefense counsel might make a persuasive point “that’s actually going to change our mind,” or\nalternatively, present arguments the defense would inevitably raise if the case went forward, and\nMenchel believed it would be to the USAO’s advantage to learn about such arguments in advance.\nMenchel also told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia ever articulating a concern that Epstein was\ncontinuing to offend, and in Menchel’s view, Epstein was “already under a microscope, at least in\nFlorida,” and it would have been “the height of stupidity” for Epstein to continue to offend in those\ncircumstances.\n\nE. June 2oo7: Villafaia Supplements the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nWhile Villafafia’s supervisors were considering whether to go forward with the proposed\ncharges, Villafafia took additional steps to support them. On June l4, 2oo7, she supplemented the\nprosecution memorandum with an addendum addressing “credibility concerns” relating to one of\nthe victims. In the email transmiting the addendum to Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her\nimmediate supervisor, Villafafia reported, “another Jane Doe has been identified and interviewed,”\nand the “different strategies” about hou to structure the charges left Villafafia unsure whether “to\nmake . . . changes nou or wait until we have received approval of the current charging strategy.”\nThe addendum itself related to a particular victim referred to as the minor who “saw Epstein most\nfrequently” and who had allegedly engaged in sexual activity with both Epstein and an Epstein\nassistant. In the addendum, Villafafia identified documents she had found corroborating four\nseparate statements made by this victim.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that the only victim about whom any supervisor ever articulated\nspecific credibility issues was the victim discussed in the addendum. Lourie told OPR that he had\nno specific recollection of the addendum, but it was “reasonable” to assume that the addendum\naddressed one particular victim because no one had identified specific concerns relating to any\nother victim. Villafafia’s immediate supervisor similarly told OPR that to her recollection, the\ndiscussions about credibility issues were generic rather than tied to specific victims.\n\nF. The June 26, 2oo7 Meeting with Defense Counsel\n\nMenchel agreed to meet with defense counsel on June 26, 2oo7, communicating directly\nwith Sanchez about the arrangements. At Menchel’s instruction, on June l8, 2oo7, Villafafia sent\na leter to defense counsel identifying what she described as “the statutes under consideration.”””!\n3 Villafafia sent copies of this leter to both Menchel and Sanchez. Villafafia told OPR that she objected to\nsending this information to the defense. Although Menchel did not recall directing Villafafia to send the leter to\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4357\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004375.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 78 of 349\nunderstood that the PBPD would not have asked the FBI to investigate Epstein if the state had\npursued the appropriate charges. In other words, in Acosta’s view, “[T]his was, rightly or wrongly,\nan analysis that distinguished between what is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to prevent manifest injustice, versus what\nis the appropriate federal outcome to that.” Acosta told OPR that he believed he had discussed his\nconcerns about the case with Lourie, Sloman, or Menchel, although he could not recall any specific\nconversation with them.\n\nE. Villafaia Drafts a “Term Sheet” Listing the Requirements of a Potential\n\nAgreement with the Defense\n\nA meeting with defense counsel was scheduled for Tuesday, July 3l, 2oo7. Villafafia told\nOPR that between July 26 and July 3o, 2oo7, she had “some sort of discussion” with her\nsupervisors that resulted in her creation of a “term sheet” identifying the proposed terms for\nresolving the federal investigation through state charges. Sometime during that period, Villafafia\nleft a voicemail message for Menchel. During their OPR interviews, neither Villafafia nor\nMenchel could recall what Villafafia said in that message. On July 3o, 2oo7, Menchel emailed\nVillafafia:\n\nI received your voicemail this morning. I don’t see any reason to\nchange our approach. I think telling them that unless the state\nresolves this in a way that appropriately vindicates our interests and\nthe interests of the victims, we will seek [federal charges] conveys\nthat we are serious. While Lilly [Sanchez] has represented in the\npast that this would likely not happen, I never conveyed it in quite\nthese terms before. In any event, this is the course of action that the\nUS Atorney feels comfortable taking at this juncture.\n\nThe follouing day, July 3l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed a one-page “Terms of Epstein\nNon-Prosecution Agreement” to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie. Villafafia told OPR she had never\nbefore seen or heard of a non-prosecution agreement and that it was a concept “completely foreign”\nto her.®° Villafafia told OPR that the idea of styling the two-year state plea agreement with Epstein\nthe state indictment. OPR considered various potential state charges involving various numbers of victims and found\nno obvious reasonable state sentencing guidelines calculation that would have resulted in a two-year sentence.\n\n8 Deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements were standard, though infrequently used, vehicles for\nresolving certain federal criminal cases against corporate entities. A 2oo8 Departmental memorandum explained:\n\nThe terms “deferred prosecution agreement” and “non-prosecution agreement”\n\nhave often been used loosely by prosecutors, defense counsel, courts and\n\ncommentators. As the terms are used in these Principles [of Federal Prosecution\n\nof Business Organizations], a deferred prosecution agreement is typically\n\npredicated upon the filing of a formal charging document by the government, and\n\nthe agreement is filed with the appropriate court. In the non-prosecution\n\nagreement context, formal charges are not filed and the agreement is maintained\n\nby the parties rather than being filed with a court. Clear and consistent use of\n\nthese terms will enable the Department to more effectively identify and share best\n\npractices and to track the use of such agreements. These Principles do not apply\n\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4375\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004395.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 98 of 349\nfor them to be deported.”!!* As to whether the foreign nationals would be removable by virtue of\nhaving commited crimes, Villafafia told OPR she did not consider her role as seeking removal\napart from actual prosecution.\n\nVillafafia concluded her email to Lefkouitz by expressing disappointment that they were\nnot “closer to resolving this than it appears that we are,” and offering to meet the next day to work\non the agreement:\n\nCan I suggest that tomorrou we either meet live or via\n\nteleconference, either with your client or having him within a quick\n\nphone call, to hash out these items? I was hoping to work only a\n\nhalf day tomorrou to save my voice for Tuesday’s hearing . . . , if\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>, but maybe we can set a time to meet. If you want to meet\n\n“off campus” somewhere, that is fine. I will make sure that I have\n\nall the <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> decision makers present or “on call,” as well.'!°\nVillafafia told OPR that she offered to meet Lefkouitz away from the USAO because conducting\nnegotiations via email was inefficient, and Villafafia wanted “to have a meeting where we sat doun\nand just finalized things. And what I meant by off campus is, sometimes people feel beter if you\ngo to a neutral location” for a face-to-face meeting.\n\nOn the morning of Monday, September l7, 2oo7, the USAO supervisor who was taking\nover Lourie’s duties as manager of the West Palm Beach office asked Villafafia for an update on\nthe plea negotiations, and she forwarded to him the email she had sent to Lefkouitz the previous\nafternoon. Villafafia told the manager, “As you can see... there are a number of things in their\nlast draft that were unacceptable. All of the loopholes that I sewed up they tried to open.”\n\nShortly thereafter, Villafafia alerted the new manager, Acosta, and Lourie that she had just\nspoken with Lefkouitz, who advised that Epstein was leaning touards a plea to state charges under\na non-prosecution agreement, and she would be forwarding to Lefkouitz “our last version of the\nNon-Prosecution Agreement.” Acosta asked that Villafafia “make sure they knou it[’]s only a\ndraft” and reminded her that “[t]he form and language may need polishing.” Villafafia responded,\n“Absolutely. There were a lot of problems with their last atempt. They tried to re-open all the\nloopholes that I had sewn shut.” Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz the draft NPA that she had provided\nto Lefcourt on September ll, 2oo7, noting that it was the “last version” and would “avoid [him]\nhaving to reinvent the wheel.” She also updated the FBI case agents on the status of negotiations,\nnoting that she had told her “chain of command . . . that we are still on for the [September] 25th\n[to bring charges] . . . , no mater what.”\n\nAfter receiving the draft NPA, Lefkouitz asked Villafafia to provide for his review a factual\nproffer for a federal obstruction of justice charge, and, with respect to the NPA option, asked, “[I]f\nls According to the case agents, the West Palm Beach FBI office had an ICE agent working with them at the\nbeginning of the federal investigation, and the ICE agent normally would have looked into the immigration status of\nany foreign national, but neither case agent recalled any immigration issue regarding any of the Epstein employees.\nts Lefkouitz was based in New York City but traveled to Miami in connection with the case.\n\n7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4395\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004429.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l32 of 349\nwhether it is beter to have us partnered in the case or just serve a\nreview function) and he said he’d get back to me later today.\n\nOosterban told OPR that this email reflects that he likely told Acosta that he intended to\nlimit CEOS’s role to review only, and Acosta asked him to “make sure the defense is okay with\nthat,” to preempt a possible defense complaint about CEOS’s involvement in the review.\nOosterban explained to OPR that “the defense ke[pt] bringing up new arguments and new\nproblems and [the USAO was saying] look if we’re going to do this, if you’ve got a problem with\nit, tell us nou.”\n\nBy February 25, 2oo8, Lefkouitz told Oosterban, who informed Sloman, that the CEOS\nrole should be “review only.” Lourie had just then left the Department to enter private practice,\nand Oosterban continued to keep his direct supervisor, Deputy Assistant Atorney General\nMandelker, informed of the defense team contacts. Sloman emailed Lefkouitz that CEOS was\n“ready to proceed immediately” with a review of the mater. Sloman advised Lefkouitz that “in\nthe event CEOS decides that a federal prosecution should not be undertaken against Mr. Epstein,\nthis Office will close its investigation,” but that, “should CEOS disagree with Mr. Epstein’s\nposition, Mr. Epstein shall have one week to abide by [the NPA].” Sloman forwarded this email\nto Villafafia, who responded, “Why would we possibly let him keep the same deal after all he has\nput us through? And after we have discovered 6 new girls... .”\n\nThe defense soon signaled that the CEOS review would not end Epstein’s requests for the\nDepartment’s involvement. On February 29, 2oo8, Lefkouitz requested a defense meeting with\nOosterban on March l2, 2oo8.'° Starr spoke to Assistant Atorney General Fisher and “made it\nclear that [the defense team would] want an audience with her if [CEOS] decid[ed] to support the\nprosecution.” On March 6, 2oo8, Acosta alerted Sloman and Oosterban that Starr and Lefkouitz\nhad called him to express “concern” about Oosterban’s participation in the case, and indicated\nthat “they may ask for more senior involvement.” Acosta “informed them that they certainly had\nthe right to ask whomever they wanted for whatever they thought appropriate, and that whatever\nprocess would be given them was up to whomever they asked.”\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz folloued up with Acosta in an email:\n\nWe appreciate that you will afford us as much time as Main Justice\n\ndetermines is appropriate for it to conduct a review of this mater.\n\nAs you have suggested, we will initiate that review process with\n\nDrew Oosterban, and engage in a discussion with him about all of\n\nthe facts and circumstances, as well as the legal and policy issues\n\nassociated with this case... .

APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA. The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.8° The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. /d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them. USAM § 9-2.o2o\nexplicitly authorizes a U.S. Atorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to\nl89 In 2ol8, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual.

USAM § 9-27.42o specifies:\n\nIn determining whether it would be appropriate to enter into a plea\nagreement, the atorney for the government should weigh all\nrelevant considerations, including:\nl. The defendant’s willingness to cooperate in the\ninvestigation or prosecution of others;\nZs The defendant’s history with respect to criminal\nactivity;\n3. The nature and seriousness of the offense or offenses\ncharged;\n4. The defendant’s remorse or contrition and his/her\nwillingness to assume responsibility for his/her conduct;\n5.

USAM Provisions Relating to Non-Prosecution Agreements\nUSAM § 9-27.6oo authorizes government atorneys to enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation. The provision explains that a non-prosecution\nagreement is appropriate for this purpose when, in the prosecutor’s judgment, the person’s timely\ncooperation “appears to be <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to the public interest and other means of obtaining the desired\ncooperation are unavailable or would not be effective.” A comment to this provision explains that\nsuch “other means” include seeking cooperation after trial and conviction, bargaining for\nl24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4448\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004454.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l57 of 349\nis subject to all rules of the court.!??

A comment to the rule clarifies that the factors\nrelevant to determining a lawyer’s competence to handle a particular mater include “the relative\ncomplexity and specialized nature of the mater, the lawyer’s general experience, the lawyer’s\ntraining and experience in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer is able to give\nthe mater, and whether it is feasible to refer the mater to, or associate or consult with, a lawyer\nof established competence in the field.” The comment further notes that “[i]n many instances the\nrequired proficiency is that of a general practitioner.” With respect to particular maters,\ncompetence requires inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem.\nThe comment to Rule 4-l.l explains that “[t]he required atention and preparation are determined\nin part by what is at stake; major litigation and complex transactions ordinarily require more\nextensive treatment than maters of lesser complexity and consequence.”\nZe FRPC 4-l.3 — Diligence\nFRPC 4-l.3 specifies that a lawyer should act with reasonable diligence and promptness in\nrepresenting a client. A comment to this rule explains, “A lawyer should pursue a mater on behalf\nof a client despite opposition, obstruction, or personal inconvenience to the lawyer and take\nwhatever lawful and ethical measures are required to vindicate a client’s cause or endeavor.” A\nlawyer must exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but is not required “to press for every\nadvantage that might be realized for a client.”\n3. FRPC 4-4.l — Candor in Dealing with Others\nFRPC 4-4.l prohibits a lawyer from knouingly making a false statement of material fact\nor law to a third person during the course of representation of a client.

U.S. Atorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.?”\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. II,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.’’).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7* A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o5 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o n.ll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding. See USAM § 9-2.o3l.\n\nl35\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4459\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004460.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l63 of 349\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was\nmotivated by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the\nUSAM to resolve the case as he deemed <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> and appropriate. As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” /d. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment). The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo446o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004461.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l64 of 349\nagreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\n\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\n\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.”\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §8§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o6 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo446l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004470.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l73 of 349\nrecord, no restitution, no sex offender status, publication at a trial of\nthe names of certain victims that didn’t want their names revealed\nand the general difficulties of a trial for the victims and their\nfamilies.\n\nAlthough his emails shoued that, at the time, he advocated for prosecution of Epstein,\nLourie told OPR it was also his general recollection that “everybody at the USAO working on the\nmater had expressed concerns at various times about the long-term viability of a federal\nprosecution of Epstein due to certain factual and legal hurdles, as well as issues with the\ncooperation and desires of the victims.”\n\nSimilarly, Menchel—who had experience prosecuting sexual assault crimes—recalled\nunderstanding that many of the victims were unwilling to go forward and would have experienced\nadditional trauma as a result of a trial, and some had made statements exonerating Epstein.\nMenchel told OPR he believed that if the USAO had filed the proposed charges against Epstein,\nEpstein would have elected to go to trial. In Menchel’s view, the USAO therefore had to weigh\nthe risk of losing at trial, and thereby re-traumatizing the victims, against the benefits gained\nthrough a negotiated result, which ensured that Epstein served time in jail, registered as a sexual\noffender, and made restitution to his victims.\n\nSloman also recalled witness challenges and concerns about the viability of the\ngovernment’s legal theories. He told OPR:\n\n[I]t seemed to me you had a tranche of witnesses who were not going\nto be reliable. You had a tranche [of] witnesses who were going to\nbe severely impeached. People who loved Jeffrey Epstein who\nthought he was a Svengali . . . who were going to say I told him I\nwas l8 years old.\n\nYou had witnesses who were scared to death of the public light\nbeing shoun on them because their parents didn’t even knou -- had\nvery vulnerable victims. You had all of these concerns.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he recalled discussions with his senior managers about the victims’\ngeneral credibility and reluctance to testify and the evidentiary strength of the case, all of which\nfactored into the resolution. He acknouledged that his understanding of the facts was not\n“sranular” and did not encompass a detailed understanding of each victim’s expected testimony,\nbut he trusted that his “team” had already “done the diligence <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>” to make\nrecommendations about the evidentiary strength of the case. Acosta recalled discussing the facts\nwith Sloman and Menchel, and possibly Lourie, none of whom had as detailed an understanding\nof the facts as Villafafia. Nevertheless, OPR credits Acosta’s statement that he reasonably\nbelieved, based on his conversations with others who expressed this view, that a trial would pose\nsignificant evidentiary challenges.\n\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony regarding witness challenges,\nincluding the FBI co-case agent, who recalled during his OPR interview that some of the victims\nhad expressed concern for their safety and “a lot of them d[id]n’t want to take the stand, and\n\nl46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo447o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004483.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l86 of 349\n\nThe meeting of USAO representatives and Epstein’s defense atorneys, together with the\nState Atorney and the lead state prosecutor on September l2, 2oo7, was a <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> part of the\nNPA negotiation process.\n\nEven after the NPA was signed, the defense continued to request meetings and reviews of\nthe case, both within the USAO and by the Department’s Criminal Division and the Deputy\nAtorney General. Although limited reviews were granted, during this period there was only one\nsubstantive meeting with Acosta, on December l4, 2oo7.7*? This meeting occurred in lieu of the\nmeeting Starr had requested of Assistant Atorney General Fisher, most likely because the defense\nsubmissions to the Department’s Criminal Division had raised issues not previously raised with\nthe USAO and the Department determined that Acosta should address those in the first instance.”**\nAcosta told OPR that he did not ask for the Department review, but he also did not want to appear\nas if he “fear[ed]” that review. Acosta’s nuanced position, houever, was not clear to the\nDepartment atorneys who responded to Epstein’s appeals and who perceived Acosta to be in favor\nof a Department review, rather than merely tolerant of it. Notably, though, none of those meetings\nor reviews resulted in the USAO abandoning the NPA, and Epstein gained no substantial\nadvantage from his continued entreaties.\n\nIn sum, in evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered the number of meetings, their\npurpose, the content of the discussions, and decisions made afterwards. OPR cannot say that the\nnumber of meetings, particularly those occurring before the NPA was signed, was so far outside\nthe norm—for a high profile case with skilled defense atorneys—that the quantity of meetings\nalone shous that the subjects were motivated by improper favoritism. In evaluating the subjects’\nconduct, OPR considered that the meetings were held with different levels of USAO managers and\nthat the explanations for the decisions to participate in the meetings reflected reasonable strategic\ngoals. Although OPR cannot rule out the possibility that because Acosta, Menchel, Lourie, or\nSloman knew or knew of the defense atorneys, they may have been willing to meet with them, it\nis also true that prosecutors routinely meet with defense atorneys, including those who are knoun\nto them and those who are not. Furthermore, meetings are more likely to occur in high profile\ncases involving defendants with the financial resources to hire skilled defense counsel who request\nmeetings at the highest levels of the USAO and the Department. Most significantly, OPR did not\nfind evidence supporting a conclusion that the meetings themselves resulted in any substantial\nbenefit to the defense. At each meeting, defense counsel strongly pressed the USAO—on factual,\nlegal, and policy grounds—to forgo its federal investigation and to return the mater to the state to\nproceed as it saw fit. The USAO never yielded on that point. Accordingly, OPR did not find\nevidence supporting a conclusion that Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia met with\ndefense counsel for the purpose of benefiting Epstein or that the meetings themselves caused\nAcosta or the other subjects to provide improper benefits to Epstein.\n\n282, Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz is discussed separately in the follouing section.\n233 Starr and other defense atorneys only obtained one meeting at the Department level, with Deputy Assistant\nAtorney General Mandelker and CEOS Chief Oosterban in March 2oo8. Although Starr requested a meeting with\nAssistant Atorney General Fisher and another with Deputy Atorney General Filip, those requests were not granted.\nl59\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4483\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004488.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l9l of 349\n\nOPR asked Villafafia about these emails and about the tenor of her interactions with\nLefkouitz during the NPA negotiations and with other defense atorneys generally. Villafafia\nacknouledged that their tone was collegial and collaborative, and explained that generally, the\ntone of these emails reflected her personality and her commitment to complete the task her\nsupervisors had assigned to her:\n\n[I|f you were to pull all my e-mails on every case, you would find\nthat that is hou I communicate with people. I’m a Minnesota girl,\nand I prefer not to be confrontational until I have to be. And I can\nbe when I need to be. But my instructions from my supervisors were\nto engage in these negotiations and to complete them. So I felt that\ngiven that task, the best way to complete them was to reach the\nagreement and, keeping in mind the terms that . . . our office had\nagreed to, and do that in a way that is civil. So... although my\nlanguage in the kind of introductory or prefatory communications\nwith Mr. Lefkouitz was casual and was friendly, when you look at\nthe terms and when he would come back to me asking for changes,\nmy response was always, “No, I will not make that change.”\n\nVillafafia denied any intention to keep the victims uninformed about the NPA or to provide\nan improper benefit for Epstein, and she explained the context of the emails in question. The email\nin which Villafafia expressed reluctance to “highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and all\nof the other persons that we could charge” was writen in response to a defense proposal to include\nin the federal plea agreement the parties were then considering a promise by the government not\nto prosecute Epstein’s assistants and other employees. Lefkouitz had proposed that the plea\nagreement state, “Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also precludes the\ninitiation of any and all criminal charges which might otherwise in the future be brought against\n[four named female assistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity] for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” Villafafia told OPR that\nthe USAO was not intending to charge Epstein’s assistants and was not aware of anyone else who\ncould be charged, and thus did not oppose the request not to prosecute third parties. Houever,\nVillafafia was concerned that an overly detailed federal plea agreement would prompt the court to\nrequire the government to provide further information about the uncharged conduct, which might\nlead Epstein to claim the government breached the agreement by providing information to the\ncourt not directly connected to the charges to which he was pleading guilty. Villafafia was not the\nonly one to express concern about hou deeply a federal court might probe the facts, and whether\nsuch probing would interfere with the viability of a plea agreement. In an earlier email, Lourie\nhad suggested charging Epstein by complaint to allou the USAO more flexibility in plea\nnegotiations and avoid the problem that a court might not accept a plea to a conspiracy charge that\nrequired dismissal of numerous substantive counts.\n\nAs to Villafafia’s offer to meet with Lefkouitz “off campus” to resolve outstanding issues\nin the NPA negotiation, she explained to OPR that she believed a face-to-face meeting at a\n“neutral” location—with “all the <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> decision makers present or ‘on call’”— might facilitate\ncompletion of the negotiations, which had dragged on for some time.\n\nl64\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4488\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004494.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l97 of 349\nsuccessful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4494\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004498.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2ol of 349\n\nThe sexual offender registration provision is yet another example of hou Acosta’s decision\nto create an unorthodox mechanism that relied on state procedures to resolve the federal\ninvestigation led to unanticipated consequences benefiting Epstein. Acosta told OPR that one of\nthe core aspects of the NPA was the requirement that Epstein plead guilty to a state charge\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender. He cited it as a provision that he insisted on from the\nbeginning and from which he never wavered. Houever, the USAO failed to anticipate certain\nfactors that affected the sexual offender registration requirement in other states where Epstein had\naresidence. In selecting the conduct for the factual basis for the crime requiring sexual offender\nregistration, the state chose conduct involving a victim who was at least l6 at the time of her\ninteractions with Epstein, even though Epstein also had sexual contact with a l4-year old victim.\nThe victim’s age made a difference, as the age of consent in New Mexico, where Epstein had a\nresidence, was l6; therefore, Epstein was not required to register in that state. As a 2oo6 leter\nfrom defense counsel Lefcourt to the State Atorney’s Office made clear, the defense team had\nthoroughly researched the details and ramifications of Florida’s sexual offender registration\nrequirement; OPR did not find evidence indicating similar research and consideration by the\nUSAO.\n\nFinally, Acosta was well aware that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI’s atention\nbecause of a concern that the State Atorney’s Office had succumbed to “pressure” from defense\ncounsel. Villafafia told OPR that she informed both Acosta and Sloman of this when she met with\nthem at the start of the federal investigation. Although Acosta did not remember the meeting with\nVillafafia, he repeatedly told OPR during his interview that he was aware that the PBPD was\ndissatisfied with the State Atorney’s Office’s handling of the case. Shortly before the NPA was\nsigned, moreover, additional information came to light that suggested the State Atorney’s Office\nwas predisposed to manipulating the process in Epstein’s favor. Specifically, during the\nSeptember l2, 2oo7 meeting, at the state prosecutor’s suggestion, the USAO team agreed, with\nAcosta’s subsequent approval, to permit Epstein to plead guilty to one state charge of solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, rather than the three charges the USAO had originally\nspecified. The state prosecutor assured Lourie that the selected charge would require Epstein to\nregister as a sexual offender. Shortly thereafter, the USAO was told by defense counsel that despite\nthe assurances made to Lourie, the state prosecutor had advised Epstein—incorrectly, it turned\nout—that a plea to that particular offense would not require him to register as a sexual offender.\nYet, despite this evidence, which at least suggested that the state authorities should not have been\nconsidered to be a reliable partner in enforcing the NPA, Acosta did not alter his decision about\nproceeding with a process that depended completely on state authorities for its successful\nexecution.\n\nOPR finds that Acosta was reasonably aware of the facts and circumstances presented by\nthis case. He stated that he engaged in discussions about various aspects of the case with Sloman\nand Menchel, and relied upon them for their evaluation of the legal and evidentiary issues and for\ntheir assessment of trial issues. Acosta was copied on many substantive emails, reviewed and\nrevised drafts of the NPA, and approved the final agreement. Yet, rather than focusing on whether\nthe state’s prosecution was sufficient to satisfy the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, Acosta\nfocused on achieving the minimum outcome <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to satisfy the state’s interest, as defined in\npart by the state’s indictment, by using the threat of a federal prosecution to dictate the terms of\n\nl74\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4498\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004511.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l4 of 349\nfrom Villafafia and others, but given the highly unusual procedure being considered, his decision\nshould have been made only after a full consideration of all of the possible ramifications and\nconsequences of pushing the mater into the state court system, with which neither Villafafia nor\nthe other subjects had experience, along with consideration of the legal and evidentiary issues and\npossible means of overcoming those issues. OPR did not find evidence indicating that such a\nmeeting or discussion with the full team was held before the decision was made to pursue the\nstate-based resolution, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term of incarceration, or\nbefore the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed. As Acosta later recognized and told OPR,\n“And a question that I think is a valid one in my mind is, did the focus on, let’s just get this done\nand get a jail term, mean that we didn’t take a step back and say, let’s evaluate hou this train is\nmoving?”\n\nMany features of the NPA were given inadequate consideration, including core provisions\nlike the term of incarceration and sexual offender registration, with the result that Epstein was able\nto manipulate the process to his benefit. Members of his senior staff held differing opinions about\nsome of the issues that Acosta felt were important and that factored into his decision-making.\nThere does not seem to be a point, houever, at which those differing opinions were considered\nwhen forming a strategy; rather, Acosta seems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him\nfolloued and atempted to implement but without a considered strategy beyond ataining the three\ncore elements. As the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had authority to proceed in this manner, but many of\nthe problems that developed with the NPA might have been avoided with a more thoughtful\napproach. As Acosta belatedly recognized, “[I]f I was advising a fellou U.S. Atorney today, I\nwould say, think it through.”?*?\n\nNo one of the individual problems discussed above necessarily demonstrates poor\njudgment by itself. Houever, in combination, the evidence shous that the state-based resolution\nwas ill conceived from the start and that the NPA resulted from a flawed decision-making process.\nFrom the time the USAO opened its investigation, Acosta recognized the federal interest in\nprosecuting Epstein, yet after that investigation had run for more than a year, he set the\ninvestigation on a path not originally contemplated. Having done so, he had responsibility for\nensuring that he received and considered all of the <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> information before puting an end to\na federal investigation into serious criminal conduct. Acosta’s failure to adequately consider the\nfull ramifications of the NPA contributed to a process and ultimately a result that left not only the\nline AUSA and the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also caused victims and the public to question\nthe motives of the prosecutors and whether any reasonable measure of justice was achieved.\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he chose a course of\naction that was in marked contrast to the action that the Department would reasonably expect an\natorney exercising good judgment to take.\n\n259 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney acknouledged that “[t]he mater would have\nbenefited from more consistent staffing and atention.”\nl87\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004542.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 245 of 349\nreview the appropriateness of the potential federal charges and the government’s “unprecedentedly\nexpansive interpretation” of l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn a December l9, 2oo7 response to the defense team, Acosta offered to revise two\nparagraphs in the NPA to resolve “disagreements” with the defense and to clarify that the parties\nintended Epstein’s § 2255 liability to “place these identified victims in the same position as they\nwould have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial.

Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR that, while there were\nvalid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is\na case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required. I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to meet with each and every [victim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key conclusion that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for resolution after development of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\nintention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\nconcluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*°°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, “[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 Guidelines for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]uidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4567\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004591.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 294 of 349\n\nThereafter, in his December l9, 2oo7 leter to defense counsel mainly addressing other\nmaters, Acosta informed the defense that the USAO would defer to the State Atorney’s discretion\nthe responsibility for notifying victims about Epstein’s state plea hearing:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court [plea and]\nsentencing hearing.

Let’s not assume. . . that the State Atorney’s office is full of bad actors.”\nSloman initially believed that “the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially\nbecause they had restitution rights under [§] 2255”; but his expectations changed after “there was\nan agreement made that we were going to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to\ndecide hou the victims were going to be notified.”*!7 Sloman told OPR he had been “proceeding\nunder the belief that we were going to notify the victims,” even though “this was not a federal\ncase,” but once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO “had concerns that if\nwe g[a]ve them the victim notification leter .. . and the deal fell apart, then the victims would be\ninstantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary compensation.”\n\nOPR could not determine whether the State Atorney’s Office notified any victims in\nadvance of the June 3o, 2oo8 state plea hearing. Krischer told OPR that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad a robust and effective victim notification process and staff, but he was not aware of whether\nor hou it was used in the Epstein case. Belohlavek told OPR that she could not recall whether\nvictims were notified of the hearing nor whether the state law required notification for the\naly Sloman stated in his June 3, 2oo8 leter to Deputy Atorney General Filip that Acosta made the decision\ntogether with the Department’s Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker. Acosta did consult\nwith Mandelker about the § 2255 civil damages recovery process, but neither Acosta nor Mandelker recalled\ndiscussing the issue of victim notification, and OPR found no other documentation indicating that Mandelker played\na role in the deferral decision.\n\n267\nDOJ-OGR-oooo459l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004593.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 296 of 349\nB. Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims\nIdentified in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea\nHearing\n\nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the\nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that\nthe federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state\ncharges. As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to\ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney. His decision that the\nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Atorney’s\njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view. Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim notification “to the discretion of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta recognized that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases. ‘7?\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have recognized the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate notification would have\nincluded advising victims identified in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility for victim notification\nentirely to the State Atorney’s discretion without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the identification of several victims who had not been identified by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the notification\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal notification obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such notification, he nonetheless left responsibility for such notification to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4593\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004596.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 299 of 349\nargued that Acosta should have been able to rely on his staff to accomplish the victim notification\ntask, and thus had no responsibility to personally confirm that Chief Reiter would notify the\nvictims of the hearing.*”® Acosta is correct that under usual circumstances, USAO management\nplayed no role in the victim notification process; houever, in this case, the issue of victim\nnotification had been elevated from a rote administrative task to a major area of dispute with the\ndefense. Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim notification through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its significance to their oun cases.*”°\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the\n428 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\n429 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4596\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004608.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3ll of 349\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances.

In order for jeopardy to atach to counts dismissed pursuant to a plea\nagreement, the dismissal must involve some adjudication of facts that go to the merits. For\ninstance, “a plea agreement in which the court was directly involved in a defendant’s decision to\nplead guilty to two counts, in exchange for an agreement to drop with prejudice a third count, all\non the basis of findings of certain facts which support that agreement, might perhaps constitute a\npretrial fact-finding that implicated jeopardy in its proper sense of risk of exposure.” Dionisio,\n5o3 F.3d at 84 (footnote omited).\n\nHere, the defendant was never placed in jeopardy in the United States District Court for\nthe Southern District of Florida.

No. 2o4\nat 23-36), and for the reasons set forth in the Court’s April Opinion (Apr. Op. at 9-l6), the\nprosecution of Counts Five and Six is timely.\nIV. The Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss the S2 Indictment Based on Alleged Improper\n\nPre-Trial Delay Should Be Denied\n\nThe defendant contends that the Court should dismiss the S2 Indictment because the\nGovernment’s delay in bringing the charges violates her due process rights. (Def. Mot. at 22). In\nmaking this motion, the defendant asks the Court to provide such relief for the “same reasons\ndiscussed in her prior motion” (Def. Mot. at 22)—reasons this Court already considered and\nrejected. This Court evaluated the defendant’s speculative and baseless arguments and concluded\nthat the defendant could not meet the “stringent standard” <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to prevail on a claim that any\nalleged pre-indictment delay violates her due process rights. (Apr. Op. at l7). “To prevail on a\nclaim that pre-indictment delay violates due process, a defendant must shou both that the\nGovernment intentionally delayed bringing charges for an improper purpose and that the delay\nseriously damaged the defendant’s ability defend against the charges.” (Apr. Op. at l7 (citing\nUnited States v. Cornielle, l7l F.3d 748, 75l (2d Cir. l999))).°\n\nAs to the element of actual and substantial prejudice, the Court found that the defendant\ndid “not make the strong shouing of prejudice required to support” her claim. (Apr. Op. at l7).\nThe Court concluded that the defendant “failed to establish actual prejudice from the\nGovernment’s delay in bringing charges,” rejecting the defendant’s “highly speculative”\narguments that the death of certain potential witnesses, failing memories, or lost records prejudiced\n® Moreover, “[w]here an indictment is brought within the statute of limitations, there is a\npresumption that the [defendant] was not prejudiced.” Van Stuyvesant v.

A Bill of Particulars Is Not Warranted\n\nThe defendant again seeks a bill of particulars, this time related to Counts Five and Six of\nthe S2 Indictment. Because the Government has provided the defendant with more than sufficient\ninformation—through both the S2 Indictment and discovery—to understand the charges against\nher, to prepare a defense, and to protect against double jeopardy, this motion should be denied.\nThe instant motion seeks essentially the same type of details that the defendant sought with regards\nto Counts One through Four in her prior motions. For the same reasons that the Court denied that\nprior motion, this motion should also be denied. (See Apr. Op. at l9).\n\nThe proper purpose of a bill of particulars under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(f)\nis “to provide defendant with information about the details of the charge against him if this is\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to the preparation of his defense, and to avoid prejudicial surprise at trial.” United States\nv. Torres, 9ol F.2d 2o5, 234 (2d Cir. l99o), abrogated on other grounds by United States v.\nMarcus, 628 F.3d 36, 4l (2d Cir. 2olo) (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omited).\nAccordingly, “[a] bill of particulars is required ‘only where the charges of the indictment are so\ngeneral that they do not advise the defendant of the specific acts of which he is accused.’” United\nStates v. Walsh, l94 F.3d 37, 47 (2d Cir. l999) (quoting Torres, 9ol F.2d at 234); see United\nStates v. Mahabub, No. l3 Cr. 9o8 (AJN), 2ol4 WL 4243657, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2ol4).\n\nAs was the case with the charges contained in the prior indictment, the charges contained\nin Counts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment are clear from the face of the charging instrument,\nwhich provides significant detail. As is apparent from the 23-page speaking S2 Indictment, Counts\nFive and Six concern the defendant’s participation in a conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of\nminors with Epstein and her participation in, and aiding and abeting of, the sex trafficking of a\nparticular minor identified as Minor Victim-4 with Epstein from approximately 2ool through\n2oo4.\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4728\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004729.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page 22 of 26\n\nThe S2 Indictment identifies Minor Victim-4 as a victim of the conspiracy charged in\nCount Five and the trafficking offense contained in Count Six. See, e.g., S2 Indictment 4 9(d),\n25, 27. Further, the S2 Indictment provides extensive detail regarding hou the sex trafficking\nscheme operated. See, e.g., id. §§ 6-7. In particular, the S2 Indictment explains that the defendant\nor another of Epstein’s employees would: call a minor victim to schedule an appointment to\nmassage Epstein; greet the minor victim at Epstein’s Palm Beach residence and escort her into a\nmassage room, where Epstein would then engage in sex acts with the victim; and pay the minor\nvictim hundreds of dollars in cash after the massage. See id. 7. The S2 Indictment specifies the\ntypes of sex acts involved in this conduct, see id. { 7(b), and further identifies the particular role\nthat the defendant played in facilitating the trafficking of Minor Victim-4, see id. § 9(d). Among\nother things, the S2 Indictment describes conversations the defendant had with Minor Victim-4\nand further explains that the defendant called Minor Victim-4 to schedule massage appointments,\npaid Minor Victim-4 after completing massages, sent Minor Victim-4 gifts from New York to\nFlorida, and encouraged Minor Victim-4 to bring other young females to massage Epstein. See id.\n\nGiven all of these details, the S2 Indictment alone provides a sufficient basis to deny the\ndefendant’s motion in its entirety. See, e.g., United States v. Bonventre, 646 F. App’x 73, 79 (2d\nCir. 2ol6) (“‘[E]videntiary detail is not the function of the bill of particulars.’ Particulars are\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> only where indictment charges are ‘so general that they do not advise the defendant of\nthe specific acts of which he is accused.’” (internal citation omited) (quoting Torres, 9ol F.2d at\n234; United States v.

Dkt. No. l34, at l4. In any event, the Court is not without guidance on when a\nprosecutor’s misrepresentation requires a court to suppress evidence. Precedent requires courts\nto adhere to the standards governing analogous Fourth Amendment claims when asked to\nsuppress evidence under their inherent authority. See Lambus, 897 F.3d at 4ol-o2.\n\nThe Supreme Court has set out a clear standard governing when a misrepresentation to a\nmagistrate in a warrant affidavit justifies suppression of evidence obtained as a result. See\nFranks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. l54 (l978). That standard requires more than an inadvertent\nmisstatement. “To suppress evidence obtained pursuant to an affidavit containing erroneous\ninformation, the defendant must shou that: (l) the claimed inaccuracies or omissions are the\nresult of the affiant’s deliberate falsehood or reckless disregard for the truth; and (2) the alleged\nfalsehoods or omissions were <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to the issuing judge’s probable cause finding.” United\nStates v. Canfield, 2l2 F.3d 7l3, 7l7-l8 (2d Cir. 2ooo) (cleaned up). The Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Franks forecloses the argument that all misstatements to a court—even all intentional\nmisstatements—necessarily require suppression. A defendant cannot circumvent this standard\nby couching the same arguments in due process or the court’s inherent authority instead. See\nPayner, 447 U.S. at 736.\n\nFranks also defines the standard governing when a defendant is entitled to an evidentiary\nhearing on a motion to suppress based on the Government’s misrepresentation to a court. To\njustify an evidentiary hearing, a defendant must make a “substantial preliminary shouing” of a\ndeliberately or recklessly false statement and that the alleged false statement was <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to the\ncourt’s decision.

It\nwas not unreasonable for the prosecutor to assume that Judge McMahon was concerned with\nthose sorts of communications, not communications years earlier that did not lead to a criminal\ninvestigation. The Government has represented that its present investigation into Epstein (and\nlater Maxwell) began only follouing publication of the Miami Herald expose in 2ol8. Maxwell\nhas made no substantial preliminary shouing to the contrary.\n\nThe Court also concludes that Maxwell has made no substantial preliminary shouing that\nJudge McMahon would have denied the Government’s application to modify the protective order\nif she knew about the 2ol6 communications. Materiality under Franks requires more than that a\nfact be important. It allous suppression only if “the allegedly false statement is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>” to\nthe court’s finding. Franks, 438 U.S. at l56 (emphasis added). If Judge McMahon would still\nhave ruled that the Government was entitled to ex parte modification of the protective order even\nafter seting aside the Government’s alleged misrepresentation, then Maxwell is not entitled to\nsuppression. Judge McMahon’s opinion reflects that she would have.\n\nJudge McMahon’s ruling rested on two independent grounds. Analyzing the\nGovernment’s application under Martindell, she first held that Maxwell could not have\nreasonably relied on the protective order to keep the Government from obtaining documents\nproduced during the civil litigation. Judge McMahon reasoned that a civil litigant ordinarily may\nnot rely on a protective order subject to modification to keep evidence out of the hands of\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004802.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7_ Filed o6/25/2l Pagel8 of 2l\nprosecutors. As the Court has explained above, this is consistent with the Second Circuit’s\nstatement that a protective order “provides no guarantee that [evidence] will not somehou find\nits way into the government’s hands for use in a subsequent criminal prosecution.” Andover, 876\nF.2d at lo83. Judge McMahon further reasoned that Maxwell could only have reasonably relied\non the protective order insofar as it prohibited BSF from fomenting an investigation against her\nwith confidential documents. If Judge McMahon had knoun of the 2ol6 meeting, it is\narguable—albeit far from certain—that she might have instead concluded that BSF breached\nMaxwell’s reasonable reliance interests.\n\nBut Judge McMahon also held that the Government had shoun extraordinary\ncircumstances justifying ex parte modification of the protective order. She observed that\nmodification of the protective order would serve a “significant public interest” and that the\nGovernment had demonstrated good cause to obtain the sought materials through a grand jury\nsubpoena without alerting potential targets of its criminal investigation. Extraordinary\ncircumstances or compelling need provide a sufficient, independent basis to modify a protective\norder under Martindell notwithstanding the parties’ reasonable reliance on that order. See\nMinpeco S.A. v. Conticommodity Servs., Inc., 832 F.2d 739, 742 (2d Cir. l987) (citing\nMartindell, 594 F.2d at 296). Thus, even assuming that the Government should have told Judge\nMcMahon about communications with BSF in 2ol6, and even assuming that information was\nmaterial to her analysis of Maxwell’s reasonable reliance on the protective order, Judge\nMcMahon would still have granted the Government’s application. Because the Government’s\nalleged misrepresentation was not <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to Judge McMahon’s ruling, it cannot support\nsuppression under Franks.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004803.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7 _ Filed o6/25/2l Pagel9of 2l\n\nThe Court thus finds that Maxwell has not made a substantial preliminary shouing under\neither prong of Franks, and thus that she is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing. For the same\nreasons, and because the present record does not establish a violation of due process, the Court\ndeclines to suppress the evidence obtained by the Government’s grand jury subpoena.\n\nD. Martindell provides no independent basis for suppression\n\nThe Court turns finally to Maxwell’s argument that Martindell provides an independent\nbasis for suppression. Maxwell cites no authority in her opening brief for the proposition that a\ncourt may suppress evidence because it disagrees with another court’s decision to modify a\nprotective order under Martindell. Indeed, there is no such authority. No court has ever granted\na motion to suppress on this ground. The Court declines to review Judge McMahon’s decision,\nbecause Martindell provides no basis to suppress evidence even if this Court were to disagree\nwith it.\n\nEven if Maxwell were right that this Court should review Judge McMahon’s decision on\nthe merits, that decision—like a magistrate’s probable cause determination—would be entitled to\n“sreat deference.” Leon, 468 U.S. at 9l4. Courts will uphold another judge’s decision to allou\nthe Government to obtain evidence on a motion to suppress so long as there is a “substantial\nbasis” for the decision. Salameh, l52 F.3d at ll3 (quoting //linois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 2l3, 238-\n39 (l983)). Judge McMahon found that the Government had established exceptional\ncircumstances to modify the protective order based on the factual record before her. Judge\nMcMahon concluded that modification was <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> under the circumstances to allou the\nGovernment to investigate a high-profile mater in secrecy and so not to tip off the target of the\ninvestigation. Although reasonable minds may differ—indeed, Judge Netburn reached the\nopposite conclusion—there was a substantial basis for Judge McMahon’s decision and it is thus\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004804.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7 _ Filed o6/25/2l Page 2o of 2l\nentitled to deference. As discussed, the Court is aware of no authority suggesting review of\nJudge McMahon’s modification order is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> or appropriate in these circumstances. If\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>, the Court would afford it deference and would not disturb Judge McMahon’s\nreasoned and supported decision.\n\nMaxwell’s reply brief recasts her claim for suppression under Martindell as simply\nanother argument for suppression under due process or the Court’s inherent authority. Because,\nin her view, the Government did not satisfy the requirements of Martindell, its atempt to modify\nthe protective order violated her due process rights. And because, she alleges, the Government\nmisrepresented facts to Judge McMahon, this Court should exercise its inherent authority to\nsuppress evidence as a sanction for governmental misconduct.\n\nThe Court is not persuaded. For the reasons set forth above, the Government’s\napplication for modification of the protective order did not violate Maxwell’s due process rights.\nDue process does not categorically bar an ex parte modification to a protective order, and Judge\nMcMahon found that the Government had shoun extraordinary circumstances to do so. To the\nextent Maxwell seeks suppression based on an alleged misrepresentation to Judge McMahon, for\nthe reasons set forth above, she has not met the high bar for a due process violation or made the\nrequired shouing under Franks that would entitle her to an evidentiary hearing. Whether\nMaxwell advances these arguments under Martindell or directly under due process, they do not\nsupport suppression.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the Government did not violate Maxwell’s\nconstitutional rights when it obtained evidence covered by a protective order in her earlier civil\ncase. It further finds that Maxwell is not entitled to suppression of any evidence or to an\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004840.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 28 of 8o\nfor the sexual assault crime in the Constand case.” N.T., 2/2/2ol6, at 224-25.

Instead, the trial court\nconsidered the interaction between the former district atorney and Cosby to be an\nincomplete and unauthorized contemplation of transactional immunity. The trial court\nfound no authority for the “proposition that a prosecutor may unilaterally confer\ntransactional immunity through a declaration as the sovereign.” /d. Rather, the court\nnoted, such immunity can be conferred only upon strict compliance with Pennsylvania’s\nimmunity statute, which is codified at 42 Pa.C.S. § 5947.4 Per the terms of the statute,\na The immunity statute provides, in relevant part:\n\n(a) General rule.--Immunity orders shall be available under this section in\n\nall proceedings before:\n\n(l) Courts.\n\n(b) Request and issuance.--The Atorney General or a district atorney\n\nmay request an immunity order from any judge of a designated court, and\n\nthat judge shall issue such an order, when in the judgment of the Atorney\n\nGeneral or district atorney:\n\n(l) the testimony or other information from a witness may be\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to the public interest; and\n(2) a witness has refused or is likely to refuse to testify or provide\nother information on the basis of his privilege against self-\nincrimination.\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo484o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004850.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 38 of 8o\nsame or similar story, further supports the admissibility of this evidence under the doctrine\nof chances.” /d.\n\nThe trial court recognized that the alleged assaults upon the prior bad acts\nwitnesses were remote in time, but it explained that remoteness “is but one factor that the\ncourt should consider.” /d. at 97. The court reasoned that the distance in time between\nthe prior acts and the incident involving Constand was “inversely proportional to the\nsimilarity of the other crimes or acts.” /d. (citing Tyson, ll9 A.3d at 359). Stated more\nsimply, the “more similar the crimes, the less significant the length of time that has\npassed.” /d.at 98 (citing Commonwealth v. Luktisch, 68o A.2d 877 (Pa. Super. l996)).\nThe court noted that, while there was a significant temporal gap between the prior\nincidents and Constand’s case, the alleged assaults involving the prior bad acts witnesses\noccurred relatively close in time to each other. Thus, “[w]hen taken together,” the court\nexplained, “the sequential nature of the acts coupled with their nearly identical similarities\nrenders the lapse of time unimportant.” /d. at lo9.\n\nTo be unfairly prejudicial, the trial court emphasized, the proffered evidence must\nbe “unfair,” and must have a “tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis or to\ndivert the jury’s atention away from its duty of weighing the evidence impartially.” /d. at\nloo (quoting Pa.R.E. 4o3 cmt). Evidence “will not be prohibited merely because it is\nharmful to the defendant,” and a court “is not required to sanitize the trial to eliminate all\nunpleasant facts.” /d. at loo-ol (quoting Commonwealth v. Conte, l98 A.3d ll69, ll8o-\n8l (Pa. Super. 2ol8)). For the trial court, the aforementioned similarities between\nConstand’s claim and that of the other alleged victims weighed in favor of admissibility,\nparticularly because the court believed that the Commonwealth had a “substantial need”\nfor the evidence. /d. at lo9. “Where the parties agreed that the digital penetration\noccurred, the evidence of other acts was <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to rebut [Cosby’s] characterization of\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo485o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004858.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 46 of 8o\nNational Enquirer on the details of its published interview with Cosby, and that Atorney\nSchmit negotiated a term of the setlement agreement with Constand that required her\nassurance that she would not cooperate with any future criminal investigation.

The entire\npassage reads as follous:\n\nBecause a civil action with a much louer standard for proof is possible, the\n\nDistrict Atorney renders no opinion concerning the credibility of any party\n\ninvolved so as to not contribute to the publicity and taint potential jurors.\n\nThe District Atorney does not intend to expound publicly on the details of\n\nhis decision for fear that his opinions and analysis might be given undue\n\nweight by jurors in any contemplated civil action. District Atorney Castor\n\ncautions all parties to this mater that he will reconsider this decision should\n\nthe need arise. Much exists in this investigation that could be used (by\n\nothers) to portray persons on both sides of the issue in a less than flatering\n\nlight. The District Atorney encourages the parties to resolve their dispute\n\nfrom this point forward with a minimum of rhetoric.\nId. (emphasis added).\nzs There is no doubt that there are two decisions at issue: the decision not to\nprosecute and the decision not to discuss that choice in public. The dissent would\nendorse the trial court’s selective interpretation of D.A. Castor’s language in the press\nrelease, finding at a minimum that D.A. Castor’s assertion that he would reconsider the\n“decision” is ambiguous. But a plain reading of the release belies such a construction.\nLike the trial court’s interpretation of the relevant paragraph of the press release, the\ndissent’s finding of ambiguity can result only when one overlooks the context and\nsurrounding statements quite entirely. D.A. Castor stated that he did not intend to discuss\nthe details of his decision not to prosecute. In the very next sentence, D.A. Castor stated\nthat he would reconsider “this decision” if the need arose. In context, “this decision” must\nnaturally refer to the decision not to discuss the mater with the public. This is so because\nannouncing that particular decision was the very purpose of the immediately preceding\nstatement, and the subject sentence naturally modifies that prior statement. D.A. Castor\nalready had stated earlier in the press release that he had decided not to prosecute\nCosby. Thus, when D.A. Castor referred to “this decision” in the particular paragraph\nunder examination, he was referring not to a decision addressed much earlier in the press\nrelease but rather to the decision that he had stated for the first time in the immediately\npreceding sentence. Even more compelling is the fact that the entirety of the paragraph\nrelates to D.A. Castor’s concern about the potential effect that any public statements that\nhe would make might have on jurors empaneled in a civil case. Nothing at all in that\nparagraph pertains to the decision not to prosecute Cosby. As noted, D.A. Castor already\nhad addressed the non-prosecution decision. There is no support for the notion that D.A.\nCastor was referring to his decision not to prosecute Cosby in the middle of a paragraph\ndirected exclusively to: (l) the potential impact that any public explication by D.A. Castor\nmight have upon the fairness of a civil case; and (2) D.A. Castor’s derivative decision not\nto discuss the mater publicly in order to avoid that potential impact.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 63\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4876\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004882.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 7o of 8o\nannouncing it publicly, D.A. Castor reasonably expected Cosby to act in reliance upon his\ncharging decision.\n\nWe cannot deem it unreasonable to rely upon the advice of one’s atorneys. The\nconstitutional guarantee of the effective assistance of counsel is premised, in part, upon\nthe complexities that inhere in our criminal justice system. A criminal defendant confronts\na number of important decisions that may result in severe consequences to that\ndefendant if, and when, they are made without a full understanding of the intricacies and\nnuances of the ever-changing criminal law. As Justice Black explained in Johnson v.\nZerbst, 3o4 U.S. 458 (l938):\n\n[The right to counsel] embodies a realistic recognition of the obvious truth\n\nthat the average defendant does not have the professional legal skill to\n\nprotect himself when brought before a tribunal with pouer to take his life or\n\nliberty, wherein the prosecution is presented by experienced and learned\ncounsel. That which is simple, orderly, and <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to the lawyer to the\nuntrained layman may appear intricate, complex, and mysterious.\n\nConsistently with the wise policy of the Sixth Amendment and other parts of\n\nour fundamental charter, this Court has pointed to the humane policy of\n\nmodern criminal law, which nou provides that a defendant, if he be poor,\n\nmay have counsel furnished [to] him by the state, not infrequently more able\n\nthan the atorney for the state.’\n\nThe right to be heard would be, in many cases, of litle avail if it did not\n\ncomprehend the right to be heard by counsel. Even the intelligent and\n\neducated layman has small and sometimes no skill in the science of law. If\ncharged with crime, he is incapable, generally, of determining for himself\nwhether the indictment is good or bad. He is unfamiliar with the rules of\n\nevidence. Left without the aid of counsel he may be put on trial without a\n\nproper charge, and convicted upon incompetent evidence, or evidence\n\nirrelevant to the issue or otherwise inadmissible. He lacks both the skill and\nknouledge adequately to prepare his defence, even though he [may] have\n\na perfect one. He requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the\n\nproceedings against him.\n\nId. at 462-63 (cleaned up). Not only was Cosby’s reliance upon the conclusions and\nadvice of his atorneys reasonable, it was consistent with a core purpose of the right to\ncounsel.\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4882\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004883.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 7l of 8o\n\nTo hold otherwise would recast our understanding of reasonableness into\nsomething unrecognizable and unsustainable under our law. If Cosby’s reliance was\nunreasonable, as found by the louer courts and as suggested by the Commonwealth,\nthen reasonableness would require a defendant in a similar position to disbelieve an\nelected district atorney’s public statement and to discount the experience and wisdom of\nhis oun counsel. This notion of reasonableness would be manifestly unjust in this context.\nDefendants, judges, and the public would be forced to assume fraud or deceit by the\nprosecutor. The atorney-client relationship would be predicated upon mistrust, and the\ndefendant would be forced to navigate the criminal justice process on his oun, despite\nthe substantial deficit in the critical knouledge that is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> in order to do so, as so\ncompellingly explained by Justice Black.\n\nSuch an understanding of reasonableness is untenable. Instead of facilitating the\nright to counsel, it undermines that right. We reject this interpretation. We find nothing\nunreasonable about Cosby’s reliance upon his atorneys and upon D.A. Castor’s public\nannouncement of the Commonwealth’s charging decision.\n\nThe trial court alternatively suggested that Cosby’s belief that he would never be\nprosecuted, thus stripping him of his Fifth Amendment rights, based upon litle more than\na press release, was unreasonable because neither Cosby nor his atorneys demanded\nthat the terms of any offers or assurances by D.A. Castor be reduced to writing. This\nreasoning is unpersuasive. Neither the trial court, nor the Commonwealth for that mater,\ncites any legal principle that requires a prosecutor’s assurances to be memorialized in\nwriting in order to warrant reasonable reliance. We decline to construe as unreasonable\nthe failure to do that which the law does not require.\n\nIt also has been suggested that the level of the defendant’s sophistication is a\nrelevant factor in assessing whether his reliance upon a prosecutor’s decision was\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 7o\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4883\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004888.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 76 of 8o\notherwise cooperating with the government to his detriment, due process requires that\nthe prosecutor's promise be fulfilled). In light of the extent and duration of Cosby’s\nreliance, induced as intended by then-District Atorney Castor, no other remedy will do.\nAnything less under these circumstances would permit the Commonwealth to extract\nincriminating evidence from a defendant who relies upon the elected prosecutor’s words,\nactions, and intent, and then use that evidence against that defendant with impunity.\n\nThe circumstances before us here are rare, if not entirely unique. While this\ncontroversy shares some features of earlier cases that contemplate the constitutional role\nof prosecutors, that import contract principles into the criminal law, and that address the\nbinding nature of prosecutorial promises in plea agreements and in other situations—as\nwell as breaches of those promises—there are no precedents directly on point that would\nmake the remedy question an easy one. As the concurring and dissenting opinion\n(“CDO”) observes, the circumstances of this case present a “constellation of . . . unusual\nconditions.”2° It is not at all surprising, then, that a reasonable disagreement arises\nregarding the remedy that must be afforded for what we and the CDO agree was a\nviolation of Cosby’s due process rights.\n\nIn our respectful judgment, the CDO’s proposed remedy, a third criminal trial of\nCosby—albeit one without his deposition testimony—falls short of the relief <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to\nremedy the constitutional violation. Specific performance is rarely warranted, and should\nbe imposed only when fairness and equity demand it. As the CDO notes, such a remedy\ngenerally should be afforded only under “drastic circumstances where the defendant\ndetrimentally relies on an inducement and cannot be returned to the status quo ante.”°°\n29 See CDO at 4.\n\n#o Id. at 9.\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4888\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004901.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 8 of 23 |\nXj3qigra SEALED |\n( l information and what was confidential about this, and just\n2 reading the tea leaves, I'm thinking to myself, what am I |\n5 supposed to do with this protective order that looks like it\n4 stands on precarious footing to begin with?

It was long the law that the parties |\nneeded to make a document-by-document shouing of good cause whenever discovery materials |\nwere filed with the court under seal. Jn re Agent Orange Prod. Liab, Litig., 82l F.2d l39, l48 |\n(2d Cir. l987) (Agent Orange). |\nIn recent years, houever, the Second Circuit has relaxed the Rule 26(c) “good cause” |\nshouing for discovery materials that are never filed with the court, in light of changes to the |\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure. TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d at 233 n.ll. The new, more lax |\nstandard recognizes that, “Without an ability to restrict public dissemination of certain discovery |\nmaterials that are never introduced at trial, litigants would be subject to needless annoyance, |\nembarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense.” Iridium India Telecom Ltd. v. |\nMotorola, Inc., l65 F. App’x 878, 88l (2d Cir. 2oo5) (summary order) (emphasis added) |\n(quoting TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d at 229). |\nAs a result, the “good cause” shouing <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for entry of a blanket pretrial protective |\norder like the one entered in Giuffre is not onerous. Dorset v. Cty. of Nassau, 289 F.R.D. 54, 67 |\n(E.D.N.Y. 2ol2). “[W]here “a protective order (l) is entered on a shouing of good cause as |\nrequired by Rule 26(c), (2) is limited to the context of pretrial civil discovery, and (3) does not |\nrestrict the dissemination of the information if gained from other sources,” it is not improvidently |\ngranted.

If Any Party Relied on the Protective Order To Shield Confidential |\nMaterials from Disclosure to Law Enforcement, That Reliance Was\nUnreasonable |\nUnder Martindell, a court must consider the degree to which the party opposing unsealing |\n(or, in this case, the party who could be expected to oppose unsealing) reasonably relied on the |\nprotective order. “Once a confidentiality order has been entered and relied upon, it can only be |\nmodified if an ‘extraordinary circumstance’ or ‘compelling need’ warrants the requested |\nmodification.” F.D.LC. v. Ernst & Ernst, 677 F.2d 23o, 232 (2d Cir. l982) (emphasis added) |\n(internal quotation omited). |\nI will assume, for purposes of argument, that Maxwell would oppose releasing Boies |\nSchiller from the terms of the Protective Order in order to accommodate the grand jury |\nsubpoena; that is fairly obvious from her refusal to agree to a protective order that would have |\npermited Boies Schiller to comply with the subpoena without a court order authorizing |\ncompliance. I further assume she would argue that she relied on the Protective Order in deciding |\nwhether and hou to comply with various discovery requests. The question to be decided is |\nwhether such reliance was reasonable. |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo89o |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo494o |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004941.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page l8 of 27\n. To Be Filed Under Seal\n\n“An examination of Second Circuit case law reveals the follouing factors are relevant\nwhen determining whether a party has reasonably relied on the protective order: (l) the scope of |\nthe protective order; (2) the language of the order itself; (3) the level of inquiry the court :\nundertook before granting the order; and (4) the nature of reliance on the order.” In re Ethylene |\nPropylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) Antitrust Litig., 255 F.R.D. 3o8, 3l8 (D, Conn. 2oo9). |\nThe first factor—the scope of the Protective Order—favors granting the Government’s |\napplication for modification. As discussed, the Protective Order was “a broad blanket order, |\nstipulated to by the parties, which afforded the parties the discretion to designate whatever they |\nproduced as ‘confidential.’” Nielsen Co. (U.S.), LLC v. Success Sys., Inc., ll2 F. Supp. 3d 83, | |\nl2o (S.D.N.Y. 2ol5). Blanket pretrial protective orders, drafted by the parties and “so ordered” |\nby the court, are common. This case was no exception. “A broad protective order is less likely |\nto elicit reliance ‘because it is more difficult to shou a party reasonably relied on a blanket order |\nin producing documents or submiting to a deposition.’” Jd. (quoting EPDM, 255 F.R.D, at 3l9). |\nThe second factor—the language of the Protective Order itself—similarly weighs in favor |\nof modification. The Protective Order provided that confidential information could be used at |\ntrial. (Protective Order, §§ 4, l3.) As the Second Circuit has repeatedly held, a temporary or |\nlimiting provision in a protective order undercuts a finding of reasonable reliance, because from |\nthe outset there was the very real possibility that material produced in discovery would end up in |\nthe public record. See, e.g., Agent Orange, 82l F.2d at l47. The very fact that material would |\nhave to be unsealed for trial undercuts a finding of reliance. |\nAdditionally, where material contained in court filings is concerned, any expectation of |\nconfidentiality is necessarily grounded on the court’s decision whether to grant the motion to seal |\n(presumably after weighing the <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> factor)—nof reliance on the protective order.

Maxwell\ncontends that the Government’s delay in bringing charges has prejudiced her interests because\npotential witnesses have died, others have forgoten, and records have been lost or destroyed. It\nis highly speculative that any of these factors would make a substantial difference in her case.\n\nThe Court thus again concludes for the reasons stated in the April l6, 2o2l Opinion &\nOrder, that Maxwell has failed to establish actual prejudice from the Government’s delay in\nbringing charges.

Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 699-7oo (l974), to justify these additional subpoenas.\n\nAs with her First Motion, she makes this motion ex parte for the “strong policy reasons in\nfavor of an ex parte” process and because she is providing detail regarding her investigative and\ntrial strategy to demonstrate compliance with the specificity, relevance, and admissibility\nrequirements of a Fed. R. Crim. P. l7 subpoena. United States v. Reyes, l62 F.R.D. 468, 47o\n(S.D.N.Y. l995).\n\nI. The Additional Subpoenas\n\nMs. Maxwell seeks to serve Rule l7 subpoenas on the follouing law firms and\n\nindividuals. The subpoenas seek specific items each identified in their respective Atachment A:\nl. Annie Farmer (Ex. l)\n\n2. Maria Farmer (Ex. 2)\n\n3. Brad Edwards, Esq. of Edwards Potinger (Ex. 3)\n\n4.

See, e.g., Annie\nFarmer v. Indyke, et al., No. l9 Civ. lo475 (LGS). The proposed BSF Subpoena calls for\nproduction of particular physical items that belong to Annie Farmer, specifically a journal, black\nboots, and certain photographs. BSF produced photos of those items (and PDF replications of\nthe photographs) to Ms. Maxwell in the Annie Farmer action. It is unknoun whether the items\nare currently in the possession of BSF or Ms. Annie Farmer. Ms. Maxwell proposes to serve a\nsubpoena, atached as Exhibit l, on Ms. Annie Farmer for the physical items; counsel also\nproposes that service be effected through BSF if they are willing to accept service.' Inspection\nof each of these items in advance of trial is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for the reasons set forth in the Ms.\nMaxwell’s First Motion.\n\nMs. Maxwell seeks also to serve a subpoena on Ms. Annie Farmer in the event that BSF\nclaims the physical items are not in their custody or control, but rather belong to (and are in the\npossession of) their client. The proposed subpoena seeks no new or additional information\nbeyond that which is sought by the BSF Subpoena.\n\nSimilarly, Ms. Maxwell seeks also to serve a subpoena on Annie Farmer’s older sister,\nMaria Farmer. See Exhibit 2. Like Annie, Maria Farmer is represented by BSF. See Maria\nFarmer v. Indyke et al., l9 Civ. lo474 (NRB). Ms. Maxwell seeks to serve the proposed\nsubpoena on Maria Farmer through BSF if they are willing to accept service.\n\nDefense counsel does not believe that Maria Farmer is mentioned in the Indictment,\nhouever, counsel believes the government will offer her as a witness at this criminal trial either\n\n' Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3) requires notice to an alleged victim where “personal or\nconfidential information about a victim” is being sought.

The Court has scheduled three days for prospective jurors to complete the final\nCourt-approved questionnaire, and four days to conduct examination of prospective jurors.\n\nBut a questionnaire by itself is not sufficient in this case to root out potential juror bias\nand to permit the atorneys to exercise intelligent peremptory challenges. Supplementing a\nrobust questionnaire with individual sequestered voir dire and limited examination of jurors by\ncounsel is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> in this case because of the sensitive subject mater of the charges and two\ntypes of unfairly prejudicial media atention: (i) the pretrial publicity that this case has received\nand will continue to receive throughout the duration of the trial and (ll) the extensive prior\nnegative publicity concerning Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe intense negative media coverage of Ms. Maxwell and Epstein, most profoundly in\nthe aftermath of his death in August 2ol9 and the arrest of Ms. Maxwell in July 2o2o, has\nsignificantly increased the likelihood that prospective jurors will report to jury selection with\npreconceptions, impressions, and opinions about the conduct at issue in the trial and those\naccused of the charges in the indictment: Ms. Maxwell and Epstein An unprecedented amount of\nmedia coverage has focused on this case, Ms. Maxwell and Epstein. The publicity includes\nextensive coverage in the press, including newspapers, magazines, and on-line sites; in broadcast\nmedia, including regular and cable television stations, radio, and streaming platforms, such as\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005210.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Page5ofl7\nIndividual voir dire is appropriate and within the court’s discretion in cases like this\nwhere the potential jury pool has been exposed to extensive pretrial publicity and may harbor\nprejudice against the defendant, and where the allegations touch on issues that are potentially\ninflammatory. See Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3; see also United States v. Rahman,l89 F.3d 88, l22\n(2d Cir. l999).

A tsunami of reporting in\nevery conceivable form — newspapers, magazines, books, television, radio, video streaming\n\nservices, podcasts, social media platforms — has broadcast this case locally, nationally, and\n\nglobally. Without a doubt, and without any credible evidentiary basis, Ms. Maxwell has been\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005213.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Page8ofl7\ndounfall of other prominent New Yorkers due to sex scandals: former Governors David Paterson\nand Andrew Spitzer, former New York Atorney General Eric Schneiderman, former U.S.\nCongressman Andrew Wiener, not to mention the many New York-based television celebrities\nagainst whom serious allegations of sexual abuse have been alleged: Mat Lauer, Roger Ailes,\nBill O’Reilly.\n\nThe fact that a woman nou stands trial for charges almost exclusively alleged against\nmen heightens the interest and intrigue of this case. There are literally hundreds if not thousands\nof negative articles about Ms. Maxwell and Epstein in the very newspapers, television stations,\nand streaming platforms to which the jury pool in this case are regularly exposed (New York\nDaily News, New York Post, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, NY l, ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox,\nNetflix, Peacock).\n\nThe jury pool from which the jury in this case will be selected has been exposed to more\nthan its fair share of media coverage fomenting public outrage at individuals accused of sex\ncrimes, like Ms. Maxwell. The negative publicity has been so pervasive, vitriolic, and extreme\nthat Ms. Maxwell has been demonized in the press. While the Court has no pouer to protect Ms.\nMaxwell from such public contempt, it can exercise its supervisory pouers and discretion and\nimplement protocols designed to obtain an open-minded jury sworn to return a verdict based\nsolely on evidence presented at trial.\n\nI. A ROBUST JURY QUESTIONNAIRE AND INDIVIDUAL VOIR DIRE ARE\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">NECESSARY</span> FOR THIS CASE\n\nA. A Questionnaire Alone Is Insufficient to Uncover Potential Juror Bias\n\nIn cases like this—where there has been pervasive media exposure that inflames passions\nabout the underlying events and demonizes a party—prospective jurors can form biases long\nbefore they appear for jury service. Once a pretrial judgment is made, the concepts of “belief\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005215.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Pageloofl7\nanswers that seem acceptable to the Court and counsel. For example, in this case it is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>\nto ask jurors if they or a family member have ever been a victim of sexual abuse—a question that\nmost jurors will not be inclined to answer in public. In a case that has received media atention or\ninvolves a well-knoun defendant, a larger jury panel is often assembled in an atempt to increase\nthe odds of obtaining a fair jury. The paradox is that a larger panel can mean that jurors are even\nless inclined to speak up in front of a large group. Accordingly, in a high-publicity case such as\nthis, q questionnaire alone is insufficient.\n\nB. Individual Sequestered Voir Dire is <span class=\"highlight\">Necessary</span> Due to the Sensitive Nature\n\nof the Charges\n\nThe nature of the charges in this case poses special problems for jury selection rarely\nencountered in the average federal jury trial. The crimes charged (concerning sexual abuse of\nminors) are particularly inflammatory and of great concern to communities from which jurors are\ndrawn. The charges tap into strongly held moral, ethical, and religious beliefs concerning\nappropriate, inappropriate, and immoral behavior and conduct, and can produce visceral and\nemotional reactions leading to more severe judgments based on preconceived viewpoints rather\nthan on admissible evidence presented at trial As such, prospective jurors’ opinion and beliefs\nregarding the nature of the crimes charged will need to be addressed through procedures that\nmaximize juror openness, honesty, and candor.\n\nIt is only through in-depth questioning and exploration of jurors’ views on these issues\nthat both the defense and prosecution can uncover what is needed to pursue challenges for cause\nand to intelligently exercise peremptory challenges. The experiences and backgrounds of jurors\ncould have significant bearing on the potential biases that they have. A variety of potential\nexperiences, both general (e.g., being a victim of a crime or closely related to a victim) and\nspecific (e.g., harassment, molestation, unwanted sexual contact, sexual assault, rape, domestic\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005217.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Pagel2ofl7\ncounsel is not afforded an opportunity to gain the <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> information upon which to base such\nstrikes.”). Without the opportunity for counsel to effectively probe for hidden prejudices, it\nwould be difficult to accomplish the goal of exercising sensitive and intelligent peremptory\nchallenges.\n\nA. The Atorneys Have More In-Depth Knouledge of the Case\nIt is counsel, not the Court, who is in the best position to obtain the information <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>\n\nto exercise intelligent peremptory challenges through atorney-conducted voir dire. The\natorneys have more in-depth knouledge of the case than the Court. See, e.g., United States v.\nCleveland, l997 WL 2554 at *3 (E.D. LA. Jan. 2, l997). Important follou-up questions are more\nlikely to occur to an advocate than a judge for several reasons, including the fact that a judge\n“does not have the advocate's awareness that soon [s]he will be making peremptory challenges\nbased on inferences from what prospective jurors have said” and the fact that “the judge does not\nknou the case of either party in detail, so that [s]he cannot realize when responses have opened\nareas for further inquiry.”” As the Fifth Circuit has recognized:\n\nA judge cannot have the same grasp of the facts, the complexities\n\nand nuances as the trial atorneys entrusted with the preparation of\n\nthe case. The court does not knou the strength and weaknesses of\n\neach litigant’s case. Justice requires that each lawyer be given an\n\nopportunity to ferret out possible bias and prejudice of which the\n\njuror himself may be unaware until certain facts are revealed.\nLedee, 549 F.2d at 993 (citing Frates and Greer, Jury Voir Dire: The Lawyer’s Perspective, 2\nA.B.A. Litigation No. 2 (l976)). Indeed, the Fifth Circuit later amplified this concept, stating\nthat “voir dire may have litle meaning if it is not conducted at least in part by counsel.”\n\nWhile Federal Rules [sic] of Criminal Procedure 24(a) gives wide\n\ndiscretion to the trial Court, voir dire may have litle meaning if it is\n\nnot conducted at least in part by counsel. The \"federal\" practice of\n\nalmost exclusive voir dire examination by the Court does not take\n2 Babcock, Voir Dire: Preserving “Its Wonderful Pouer”, 27 Stan. L. Rev. 545, 549 (l975).\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005218.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Pagel3oofl7\ninto account the fact that it is the parties, rather than the Court, who\nhave a full grasp of the nuances and the strength and weaknesses of\nthe case... Experience indicates that in the majority of situations\nquestioning by counsel would be more likely to fulfill this need [for\ninformation upon which to base the intelligent exercise of\nperemptory challenges] than an exclusive examination in general\nterms by the trial Court.\nUnited States v. Ible, 63o F.2d 389, 395 (Sth Cir. l98o).\n\nIn this case, voir dire conducted solely by the Court will interfere with the intelligent\nexercise of peremptory challenges. Atorneys have been working on this case well over a year.\nThey are most likely to knou the areas of questioning that must be explored to further uncover\nthe prejudices that are most pertinent to the evidence that will be presented at trial. They also act\nwith an awareness that they will have to base peremptory challenges on the juror's answers.\nPermiting atorney-conducted voir dire in addition to Court voir dire will therefore maximize the\ninformation obtained in voir dire.\n\nB. The Extensive Pretrial Publicity Related to This Case Necessitates Atorney-\n\nConducted Voir Dire\n\nThe possibility of prejudice in this case due to the extensive pretrial publicity is so great\nthat specific voir dire questions by counsel are <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>. In United States v. Davis, the Fifth\nCircuit held that the district court erred in not undertaking a more thorough examination of panel\nmembers exposed to publicity (“[W]here the nature of the publicity as a whole raised a\nsignificant possibility of prejudice, the cursory questioning by the court was not enough.”). A\ndistrict court is required, under Davis, to determine what each juror may have heard or read and\nhou it may have affected his atitude touard the trial, and whether any juror’s impartiality had\nbeen destroyed. /d; see also Silverthorne v. United States, 4oo F.2d 627, 638 (9th Cir. l968)\n(“[I]n the absence of an examination designed to elicit answers which provide an objective basis\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005239.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 35l Filed lo/l5/2l Page3of4\nPage 3\n\n“Given that the hearing provides an opportunity for the Rule 4l2 movant to detail the evidence he\nseeks to admit and for the parties to discuss the propriety of its admission, the notice requirement\nshould be seen as serving two purposes: l) aiding the Court in determining the threshold mater of\nwhether a hearing is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>; and 2) providing sufficient notice to the nonmovant and victim\nalike to prepare for and argue against the necessity of any in camera hearing.” United States v.\nSmith, l9 Cr. 324 (BAH), 2o2o WL 5995loo, at *l9 (D.D.C.

Indeed, it is unlikely that atorney-led\nquestioning will yield a significant change in the candidness and openness of prospective jurors if\nthe Court also limits those questions to one minute per juror, as the defense also proposes. (/d. at\nl4). Given that prospective jurors are likely to “respond honestly to questions directed to them by\na federal judge,” Saipov, 2o2o WL 958527, at *l, Court-led voir dire remains appropriate in this\ncase.\n\nAccordingly, the Government respectfully submits that the well-established practice in this\nDistrict of Court-led voir dire should be folloued. Counsel can address potential bias by proposing\nquestions for the Court to ask (as it already has) and engaging in the strike process, as is customary\nand appropriate here.\n\nI. Individual “Sequestered” Voir Dire Is Not Warranted\n\nThe Government respectfully submits that the well-established practice in this District\nshould be folloued; that is, the Court should ask most questions in open court and ask sensitive\nquestions, such as those that relate to sexual abuse and media exposure, at sidebar. The defendant\nargues that individual sequestered voir dire is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> in light of the nature of the charges in this\ncase, which she claims are “particularly inflammatory and of great concern to communities from\nwhich jurors are drawn,” and her concern that “a discussion of pretrial publicity in front of the\nentire jury pool will contaminate those few jurors who have not been subjected to the publicity.”\n(Dkt. No. 342 at 8-9). Of course, under the typical practice in the District, prospective jurors would\nnot be asked to describe their experiences with sexual assault or the details of pretrial publicity in\nfront of the rest of the venire. That questioning would happen at sidebar, in an “individual,\nsequestered” seting. But not every prospective juror may need additional questions on those\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5253\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005261.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 358 Filed lo/l8/2l Page2of4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

[and] to a wider swath of information regarding civil litigation\nagainst Epstein that is remote from Maxwell’s charged conduct.” /d. at 24. This would present\n“a significant risk that the jury will cumulate the evidence of the various crimes charged and find\nguilt when, if considered separately, it would not do so.” Jd.

When evaluating the credibility\nof those delayed disclosures, they will have the benefit of observing the Minor Victims’ testimony,\nincluding their cross-examination which is sure to address their delayed disclosure, and the Minor\nVictims’ explanation for those delays. The jury will also hear general testimony from Dr. Rocchio\nabout various circumstances that may lead victims of sexual abuse to delay disclosure. In the\ntotality of the circumstances, the jury can then decide who it finds credible.\n\nThe defendant also argues it is prejudicial to her that Dr. Rocchio suggests “that delayed\nreporting is more consistent with truthfulness than fabrication, a determination which the jury must\nmake for itself.” (Def.

It is unclear hou the defendant can simultaneously argue\nthat (l) Dr. Rocchio’s testimony improperly assumes the role of the jury by suggesting that delayed\nreporting is “more consistent” with child sexual abuse (id.); and (2) Dr. Rocchio’s testimony would\nonly help the jury if she resolved any ambiguity by saying that delayed reporting is a <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>\nconsequence of child sexual abuse (id. at l5-l6).\n\nFinally, according to the defendant, Dr. Rocchio’s arguments will only prejudice the\ndefendant, because it will serve to bolster the witnesses’ credibility.

The ongoing relationships between the defendant,\nEpstein, and the victims is directly relevant, and the victims’ accounts of these events are <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>\nto complete the story of the crime on trial. Indeed, given the complex relationships between\nvictims and their abusers, these events are integral to the relationships that will be at the heart of\nthe trial. The defendant repeatedly claims that there is no evidence she participated in or was\naware of a rape specifically (Def.

(Def. Mot. ll at 2). That is anon sequitur. Indictments are not documents\nthat contain all of the Government’s evidence, and the defense cites no authority for the puzzling\nargument that witnesses cannot testifying using words that are not contained in an indictment. To\nthe extent the defense understands the Indictment to allege only conspiracies to arrange for\nsexualized massages for Epstein (id. at 3), the defense is mistaken. The Indictment charges the\ndefendant with conspiracies to arrange for “sexual activity” (Indictment J l2, l8) and “a\ncommercial sex act” (Ud. ¥ 24).\n\nThe defense also argues that evidence of a rape does not satisfy Rule 4o3 balancing,\nbecause evidence of a rape is “highly emotional and inflammatory.” (Def.

Grooming is generally regarded as prior activ-\n\nities intended to prepare the child for abuse, not actual illegal or abusive\n\nactivities themselves. Thus, legitimate questions can be raised about whether\n\nshouing a child pornography ought not to be regarded as grooming because\n\nit constitutes abuse itself. Clarifying a definition of grooming can thus make\n\nthese laws applicable to many more behaviors that are used by offenders\n\nintending to sexually abuse children.\n\nIt is important to note that clarifying key constructs is a difficult yet\nimportant process. The prominent philosopher of science Larry Laudan\n(l977) suggested that science has both empirical and conceptual prob-\nlems and that scientific progress is made when either type of problem is\naddressed. Conceptual analysis is particularly difficult as it is traditionally\nnot included as a part of the research method in the social sciences and\nalso because it involves the inherent complexity of language (O’Donohue,\n2ol3). Here, conceptual analysis of the grooming construct is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> in the\nresearch process, as it is a salient example where the complexity of language\ncontributes to definitional confusion and leads to problematic implications\nin clinical and forensic fields.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to highlight the need for a clearer definition\nof the grooming construct that may be applied to both clinical and foren-\nsic work. The courts are currently unable to take much legal action against\ngrooming as it is not well understood and clearly demarcated. Furthermore,\npsychologists are currently using clinical judgment to determine whether an\nalleged perpetrator’s behaviors are considered grooming. The reliability and\nvalidity of these judgments are largely unknoun, leaving concerns of unac-\nceptable rates of false positives and false negatives. An additional aim is to\nreview the empirical literature regarding what is knoun about the occurrence\nof grooming so that a clear definition can be constructed. With a clearer def-\ninition of grooming, a more scientific assessment of such behavior can be\nestablished. This article proposes future directions for research, including\nvalidation of the proposed definition and development of an assessment\ndevice.\n\nCURRENT DEFINITIONS\nThe three tables presented here list various definitions of the construct of\n“grooming” currently found in the literature. Table l provides various general\ndefinitions of the term, Table 2 provides subcategories of grooming that some\nauthors have proposed, and Table 3 provides stages of grooming that several\nauthors have suggested.\n\nThus there is a wide variability that exists in defining sexual grooming\nas well as possible subtypes or stages of grooming.

In a comprehensive theory it is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to consider the whole journey from initial\nonset to the offence and beyond. In a similar way that the Transtheoretical Model (Prochaska &\nDiClemente, l982) of change considers not only the action stage, where the overt behaviour is\nchanged, but also the precontemplation, contemplation, preparation and maintenance stages, a\ntheory of sexual offending against children needs to consider the whole journey. As\ndemonstrated above, it is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> that theories of aetiology are coherent with the\nphenomenon they are atempting to explain. While endeavouring to explain sexual offending\nit is important that sexual grooming is also factored into the equation, because it is part of the\nsexual offending phenomenon. Of the above theories, only Finkelhor’s (l984) Pre-condition\nModel has taken this approach.\n\nOffence process\n\nIn addition to the Pre-condition Model (Finkelhor, l984) there is one other model that\nconsiders the offence process of sexual offending. This is the Descriptive Model of the\nOffence Chain (Ward, Louden, Hudson & Marshall, l995). Ward et al.’s model provides a\nmuch more detailed account of the offence process than the Pre-condition Model. While litle\nevidence has been found to support Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model, Ward et al. used a\ngrounded theory approach and developed their model directly from offenders’ experiences.\nThey identified nine stages of the offence chain. Stage one relates to the offender’s\nbackground factors, including their perception of themselves and their life at the beginning\nof the offence chain and whether these factors caused positive or negative affect. Stage two\ndescribes distal planning of access to their victim; this could take the form of implicit, or\nexplicit planning or chance. Contact with the victim takes place in stage three. Stage four\ninvolves cognitive restructuring, which will result in either positive or negative affect. Stage\nfive entails proximal planning, which would either be self-focused, victim-focused or a\nmutual-focus. This leads to stage six and the sexual offence, which is folloued by further\ncognitive restructuring at stage seven. This results in negative or positive evaluation and future\nresolutions regarding continued offending at stage eight. This resolution will be to either avoid\nfuture offending or to persist in an abusive patern. Stage nine depicts the impact of these\nresolutions on the offender’s life.\n\nIt is important to consider hou sexual grooming fits into, and facilitates, the offence\nprocess, as this understanding is likely to aid the management of offenders and potential\noffenders by identifying the offence process prior to an sexual offence taking place. In\naddition, it is reasonable to suggest that motivation is not static but could be affected by later\nstages of the grooming and offence process, e.g. cognitive distortions developed later in the\nprocess could serve to reinforce prior motivation resulting in an entrenched deviant sexual\ninterest. This may prove valuable to treatment programmes efforts of reducing motivation to\noffend.\n\nThe grooming process\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming present in the literature—\n\nself-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the child.\n\nEach of these will be discussed to explore current understanding of sexual grooming.\n\nUnderstanding of the grooming process and an ability to identify sexual grooming behaviour\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005903.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 36 of 43\n292 — S. Craven et al.\nis crucial in order to prevent child sexual abuse. Houever, retrospective identification of\nsexual grooming, i.e. after a sexual offence has been commited, is much easier than\nprospective identification, i.e. before a sexual offence. Nevertheless, the later is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> in\norder to prevent the sexual abuse from taking place. The reason for this is because the\nbehaviours used to groom a child for sexual abuse are not dissimilar to innocent behaviour\nintended to broaden a young person’s experiences. The only difference may be the motivation\nunderlying the behaviour.\nSelf-grooming\nvan Dam (2ool) reports that during treatment, offenders’ talk about “grooming themselves’.\nThey were referring to the justification or denial of their offending behaviour. It therefore\nseems important to consider this as part of the grooming process. Houever, it may be more\nagreeable to refer to this phenomenon by another name, avoiding the use of the term\n“grooming”. Nevertheless, self-grooming is likely to play a part in the move from being\nmotivated to sexually abuse a child to the subsequent targeting of a child, through the\njustification or denial of the steps child sexual offenders take touards abusing a child.\nFurthermore, self-grooming is likely to be affected by the response from the community and\nthe child, and the success or failure of the efforts to victimize the child. “Success” is likely to\nresult in further justification or denial of their actions and more entrenched sexual interest in\nchildren and motivation to offend. “Failure”, on the other hand, is likely to result in the\ndesistence of offending or the offender developing/enahancing his skills/strategies to ensure\nsuccess.\n\nJustification and denial of offenders’ behaviour manifests in cognitive distortions. Ward\nand Keenan (l999) propose that child sex offenders have cognitive distortions in the form of\nimplicit theories, which relate to themselves, the victim and the world. Implicit theories help\nindividuals to understand the world around them. Problems arise because offenders’ implicit\ntheories are maladaptive and supportive of sex with children. These implicit theories\nsubsequently affect encoding and interpretation of future behaviours and events. Ward and\nKeenan have identified five implicit theories that account for most of the cognitive distortions\nheld by child sex offenders: children as sexual objects; entitlement; dangerous world;\nuncontrollability; and nature of harm.\n\nOf course, it is not only offenders who have maladaptive implicit theories. For example,\nmany people have an implicit theory that children are at most risk from strangers, which is not\nconsistent with research findings. Houever, it is easier to believe that strangers sexually abuse\nchildren than accept that friends and family do; hence, this implicit theory helps to shelter\npeople from the harsh nature of reality. Offenders’ implicit theories work in a similar way,\nbecause it is easier for offenders to believe that the child seduced them than to accept that they\nsexually abused a child.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others\n\nGrooming the child begins with identifying a vulnerable child (van Dam, 2ool). Child sex\noffenders seem to have a special ability in recognizing vulnerable children (Conte et al., l989).\nThese vulnerabilities may be that the children have a poor relationship with their parents, do\nnot have many friends (Berliner & Conte, l99o), or have already been victimized (Leberg,\nl997). Alternatively, offenders may target women who were sexually abused as children,\nbecause the offender considers them easier to re-victimize.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005908.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 4l of 43\n\nSexual grooming of children 297\n\nTouards a new definition of sexual grooming of children\n\nThe definitions of sexual grooming presented at the start of this review do not reflect the\n\ncomplexity of the sexual grooming of children, which is demonstrated in the previous\n\ndiscussion of the different types of sexual grooming. Based on the above findings it seems\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to provide a new definition that atempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual\n\ngrooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining access to the child, gaining the\n\nchild’s compliance and maintaining the child’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not understood\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a child\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of child sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and development.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\nliterature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\nchild. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s\ncompliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to\noffender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\nmotivated. This would provide many benefits to child protection and the policing and\ntreatment of child sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of child sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005913.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 3of 45\n\nAlaggia et al. 26l\nCSA to authorities and the high rates reported in prevalence disclosure research, through various mixed methods, to high-\nstudies.

THIS COURT SHOULD PRECLUDE INTRODUCTION OF ALLEGED CO-\nCONSPIRATOR STATEMENTS AS A SANCTION FOR GOVERNMENT'S\nFAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THIS COURT’S SEPTEMBER 3, 2o2l ORDER\nThe government offers several excuses for its failure to comply with this Court’s\n\nSeptember 3, 2o2l Order. These excuses are insufficient and should be rejected.\n\nA. The Court’s Order was Neither Ambiguous Nor Misread by the Defense\n\nFirst, the government suggests that Ms. Maxwell has misread the Order. We disagree.\nThe Court unambiguously rejected the government’s position and ruled that the government’s\nexpressed concern about disclosure “does not outweigh the risk of surprise to the Defendant in\nthis case or the need for the parties to litigate co-conspirator issues in advance of trial to ensure\nthe absence of delay.” Dkt. 335 at 3. To both “avoid the risk of surprise” and “litigate co-\nconspirator issues in advance of trial to ensure the absence of delay, ” the Court identified two\nthings that were <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> from the government: First, no later than October ll, 2o2l, the\ngovernment was required to “disclose to the defense the identities of any unnamed co-\nconspirators who allegedly participated in the conspiracies charged in the S2 indictment to whom\nthe government will refer at trial.” Jd. Second, the Court, unambiguously and emphatically,\ndirected: “The Government is FURTHER ORDERED to disclose a// co-conspirator hearsay\nstatements it intends to offer at trial no later than October ll, as consistent with this Court’s\nscheduling order. Dkt. No. 297 at l.” (emphasis in original.)\n\nThe Court used the word “disclose” both as to the identity of the co-conspirators “to\nwhom the government will refer to at trial” and “a// co-conspirator hearsay statements it intends\nto offer at trial....” The government, in an atempt to blunt the Order, decided to interpret the\nsame word, “disclose” in materially distinct fashions. As to the identity of the co-conspirators,\nthe government disclosed (7.e., identified) three names. When it was parsing the second part of\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5962\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005986.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 3l of 52\n4o4(b) (id. at 46-47), (3) her evidence is “intrinsic” proof of the charged conspiracies and\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to “complete the story” of the charged offenses (id. at 47-49), and (4) x\nME «as under the age of l8, the age of consent under federal law, when the alleged sexual\nabuse took place, and that is “all that is required for evidence relating to the defendant’s\nexploitation of Minor Victim-3 to be direct evidence of the charged offenses” (id. at 5o). The\nfirst is an argument for admission of this evidence under Rule 4o4(b), not as direct evidence of\nthe conspiracy. The second simply begs the question and assumes that the government can\ncircumvent Rule 4o4(b) by alleging “other act” evidence in the indictment. The third overlooks\nthe numerous precedents in this Circuit finding that evidence of criminal offenses that are\nseparate and distinct from the charged offenses are not admissible as direct evidence of a\nconspiracy. And the fourth completely misstates the law. These arguments should be rejected.\n\nFirst, the government argues that I evidence is admissible as direct\nevidence of the charged conspiracies because it is relevant to shou the “patern” of abuse—\nincluding “grooming” the accusers, encouraging them to give massages to Epstein, and asking\nthem to recruit others—and her “intent” to participate in the charged conspiracies. (/d. at 45-46).\nBut “patern” is just another word for “modus operandi,” which along with “intent” are bases for\nadmission under Rule 4o4(b), not as direct evidence of the conspiracies. See Fed. R. Evid.\n4o4(b) (“other act” evidence may be admissible to prove “motive, opportunity, intent,\npreparation, plan, knouledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident) (emphasis\nadded); United States v.

Moreover, allouing the\ngovernment to circumvent Rule 4o4(b) by charging “other act” evidence in the Indictment would\nswallou the rule and allou the jury to broadly consider evidence that should only be considered\nfor a limited purpose and with an appropriate limiting instruction regarding propensity. The\nCourt should not allou this.\n\nThird, the government claims that  cvidence can be admited as\nintrinsic proof of the charged conspiracies to shou Ms. Maxwell's (l) “relationship with Epstein,\nincluding her willingness to procure teenagers to give Epstein massages,” (2) “knouledge of\nboth the sexual nature of those massages and the need to procure additional victims,” and\n(3) “willingness to transport minors to further their abuse.” Resp. at 47. The government further\nargues that I cvidence is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to “complete the story” of the charged\noffenses. Jd. at 48-49. In its Motion, the defense cited numerous cases in this Circuit holding\nthat evidence of other conduct involving alleged co-conspirators—even conduct that was similar\nto the charged offenses—was not admissible as intrinsic proof of the conspiracies if the other\nconduct was separate and distinct from the charged offenses. See Mot. at 9 (citing cases). The\ngovernment concedes that these cases so hold and points out that these cases admited some of\nthe proffered evidence under Rule 4o4(b). Resp. at 48 n.ll. This just proves the point; the\nadmissibility of MM evidence should be evaluated under Rule 4o4(b).\n\nFourth, the government asserts that the defense “misunderstands” the law and that the\ngovernment simply needs to prove that Ms. Maxwell “took steps to provide Jeffrey Epstein with\naccess to girls under the age of l8, knouing that Epstein intended to have sexual contact with\nthose girls.” Jd. at 5o (emphasis added).

THE COURT SHOULD PRECLUDE TESTIMONY ABOUT ANY ALLEGED\n“RAPE” BY JEFFREY EPSTEIN\nThe government argues that the expected testimony of [J that she was raped\nby Jeffrey Epstein is admissible to shou the “ongoing relationships between the defendant,\nEpstein, and the victims” and is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> “to complete the story of the crime on trial.” Resp. at\n79-8o. The government offers no explanation, houever, for why testimony of an alleged rape\nwould prove the relationship “between the defendant, Epstein, and the victims” when gay\nhas never claimed in her prior statements to the FBI or anywhere else that Ms. Maxwell knew of,\nfacilitated, or participated in the alleged rape in any way. Nor does the government explain why\nthis testimony is somehou <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> “to complete the story of the crime on trial” when the rape\nallegation is an outlier and does not fit the “story” of alleged sexual abuse that the government\nhas described in the S2 Indictment—namely, “grooming” the alleged victims to gradually break\ndoun their inhibitions so that forcible rape is not required to engage in sexual activity with them.\nBecause the rape allegation is the only one of its kind and has no connection to the other\nincidents of alleged sexual abuse, it should not be admited as intrinsic proof of the charged\ncrimes. See United States v. Tounsend, No. Sl o6 CR. 34 (JFK), 2oo7 WL l288597, at *2\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5997\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005998.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 43 of 52\n(S.D.N.Y. May l, 2oo7) (defendant’s prior narcotics and firearm transactions with the same\nconfidential informant not “inextricably intertwined” with the charged narcotics conspiracy, even\nthough the conduct was “generally similar to the conduct underlying the offenses charged in the\nindictment”); United States v. Nektalov, 325 F. Supp. 2d 367, 369-7o (S.D.N.Y. 2oo4) (prior\nsimilar money laundering transactions between defendant and cooperating witness not\n“inextricably intertwined” with the charged money laundering offense or “<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to complete\nthe story” of the charged conspiracy (emphasis in original)).\n\nTestimony concerning the alleged rape should also be excluded because the S2\nIndictment contains no allegations of rape and such testimony is therefore irrelevant to the\ncharged crimes. The government dismisses this point arguing that indictments do not need to\ninclude all of the government’s evidence, and the terms “sexual activity” and “commercial sex\nact” are broad enough to cover rape. See Resp. at 8o. But this misses the point. The rape\nallegations are irrelevant to the charges because the charges are based on sexual activity that was\nillegal because the alleged victims were under the age of consent. The indictment does not\ncharge any crimes that are premised on sex acts that involve the use of force, like rape. For\nexample, Counts Five and Six charge sex trafficking offenses. See S2 Ind. 4] 22-27. But they\ndo not charge the section of the statute that criminalizes sex trafficking that “was effected by\nmeans of force, threats of force, fraud, or coercion.” l8 U.S.C. § l59l(b)(l). The government is\ntherefore off base when its states that “evidence of rape, where it occurs ... is the core conduct in\nthe case.” Resp. at 8l. It is only the “core conduct” of the case when the indictment alleges\nforcible sex acts. Indeed, the cases cited by the government prove this point. See Ex. E,\nIndictment, United States v. English, No. l8 Cr. 492 (PGG) (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o) (defendant charged\nwith sex trafficking conspiracy “effected by means of force” under l8 U.S.C. § l59l(b)(l));\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5998\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006024.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 399 Filed lo/29/2l Page2of4\nPage 2\n\nDefense Justification\n\nThe defense proposes a more limited set of redactions than the government.

For the entire day she was provided inadequate food and liquid, was not permited\nto retain and review her legal materials and was kept shackled on a metal bench in an excessively\ncold cell. This past Monday, she was awakened at 3:45 a.m. and given a broun bag with two\nsmall apples, two small containers of milk and a cup of cereal but no utensils. She was not\npermited to bring a sweatshirt for warmth. She was transported to the courthouse by two\nmarshals.

And to the extent Dr. Dietz seeks to apply his opinions to other contexts,\nthey are irrelevant.”\n\nI. CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE PROPOSED EXPERT TESTIMONY OF\n\nDR. ELIZABETH LOFTUS SHOULD BE PRECLUDED\n\nA. Background\n\nThe defense seeks to offer expert opinions of Dr. Loftus on “the workings of human\nmemory.” (Ex. A at l). Specifically, the defense seeks to offer testimony from Dr. Loftus\nregarding:\n\nl. “[H]ou memory fades and weakens over time.”\n\n’ The Government understands that Dr. Dietz is not planning on atending the November lo, 2o2l\nDaubert hearing of Dr. Rocchio, and the Government has not to date received any Rule 26.2\ndisclosures from Dr. Dietz, or even a complete bibliography of the sources cited in his disclosure.\nThe Government respectfully requests that, should a hearing be scheduled on the reliability of Dr.\nDietz’s opinions, that hearing be held after the defense’s response to this motion and after all\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> Rule 26.2 disclosures are made.\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo624o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006247.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page 36 of 4l\nSchool of Social Ecology, htps://faculty.sites.uci.edu/eloftus/ (“[Dr. Loftus’s] experiments reveal\nhou memories can be changed by things that we are told.”). Such research may thus be\ninapplicable to the facts of this case.\n\nTo the extent that the Court believes that the defense may have carried its burden of\nestablishing the reliability of Dr. Loftus’s opinions on false memory formation, the Government\nrespectfully requests a Daubert hearing to test the reliability of these opinions.”\n\nEven if any such opinions are reliable, houever, they should not be admited absent an\naffirmative shouing of “fit” for this case. See Fed. R. Evid. 7o2 advisory commitee n. (stating\nthat “generalized” expert testimony must “‘fit’ the facts of the case”). For example, testimony\nabout the ways in which “false and/or distorted memories can be created as a result of post-event\ninformation and occurrences, suggestion, influence, or the like” is irrelevant to this case. At that\nlevel of generality, it has no obvious “fit” to the facts of this case. There is no evidence that\nwhatever “occurrences, suggestion, influence, or the like” about which Dr. Loftus intends to testify\nhappened to any witness in this case, much less in a manner that reliably affects memory or would\nbe probative to the jury. Thus, as with Dr. Dietz, any reliable opinions Dr. Loftus seeks to offer\non false memory formation should be limited to those as to which there is a clear evidentiary\npredicate establishing their “fit” to the case.\n\nAs with Dr. Dietz, see footnote 9, supra, if a hearing is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>, the Government similarly\nrequests that it be conducted after receiving the defense response and after all <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> Rule 26.2\ndisclosures have been made.\na2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6247\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006272.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 4 of 29\n98 J.

The authors contended that in cases such\nas these, carefully administered and interpreted psychological evaluations\nmay provide a context for allegations by allouing the court to understand\npersonality traits, personality disorders, cognitive disability, and psychotic\nsymptoms that may affect the alleged victim’s allegations. Certain psycho-\nlogical processes have in past cases explained the lack of corroborating\naccounts between a plaintiff and a defendant. Some relevant psychologi-\ncal processes that have been suggested are psychosis, hypersensitivity when\ninteracting with others, tendency touard exaggeration, and serious cognitive\nproblems (Binder & McNeil). The authors also suggested that there may be\nseveral additional psychological markers to consider when determining the\ncredibility of a complaint. We believe that a more thorough identification of\nthese pathways is important and can be partly achieved by understanding\nthe role of psychological disorders, as currently specified by the Diagnostic\nand Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo),\nin explicating specific motivations and cognitive distortions that may be\nassociated with false allegations and malingering behaviors. Some of these\nvariables may interact in a complex manner. For instance, an individual\nwith borderline personality may place herself in riskier situations and may,\ntherefore, have an increased risk of actual sexual assault. Conversely, as\nwe discuss belou, the individual with borderline personality disorder may\nalso suffer from certain key cognitive distortions that lead to false reports.\nWe caution against a simplistic reading of this analysis in that it never is\nthe case that because a person suffers from a certain diagnosis that her alle-\ngations are, therefore, false. In addition, it can be useful for the forensic\nmental health professional to understand these pathways in context with\nthe alleged perpetrator’s mental health status. Again, no diagnosis would\nmean that the perpetrator is guilty of the accusations; houever, mental\nhealth professionals can offer expertise in helping to understand the path-\nways to false allegations and false denials. Part of the focus of the present\npaper, then, is to bring atention to the dearth of psychological literature\ninvestigating correlates and causal mechanisms of false allegations of sexual\nassault and to propose a model specifying the major causal pathways to false\nallegations. These pathways are intended as a model for further empirical\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, a legitimate concern about enumerating such pathways is the\nmisuse of psychological diagnoses in determining the accuracy of specific\naccusations. It is important to recognize that a model that comprehensively\nand accurately identifies pathways provides information regarding <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6272\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006314.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 427 Filed ll/o9/2l Page3ofl6\nDraft Pre-Voir Dire Remarks — November 8, 2o2l\n\nl United States v.

There is no reason to think the jury\nwill so speculate if they do not learn hou the Florida investigation terminated.

As set forth here and more fully in Dr. Rocchio’s Jencks\nAct material, Dr. Rocchio has elaborated on her opinions about the relationship between child\nsexual abuse and traumatic memory.’ The defendant adds that, because Dr. Rocchio’s opinion is\nthat delayed disclosure is consistent with sexual abuse but not a <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> consequence of sexual\nabuse, jurors have no means to determine whether a Minor Victim is lying or telling the truth.\n7 The defendant also argues that Dr. Rocchio is not an expert in “the human brain or memory\ngenerally.” (Def.

Mot. 3 at l6). This argument misunderstands the role of the jury. Jurors are not tasked\nmerely with applying Dr. Rocchio’s expertise to facts. The jury will hear testimony that some\nMinor Victims did not immediately disclose their sexual abuse. When evaluating the credibility\nof those delayed disclosures, they will have the benefit of observing the Minor Victims’ testimony,\nincluding their cross-examination which is sure to address their delayed disclosure, and the Minor\nVictims’ explanation for those delays. The jury will also hear general testimony from Dr. Rocchio\nabout various circumstances that may lead victims of sexual abuse to delay disclosure. In the\ntotality of the circumstances, the jury can then decide who it finds credible.\n\nThe defendant also argues it is prejudicial to her that Dr. Rocchio suggests “that delayed\nreporting is more consistent with truthfulness than fabrication, a determination which the jury must\nmake for itself.” (Def.

It is unclear hou the defendant can simultaneously argue\nthat (l) Dr. Rocchio’s testimony improperly assumes the role of the jury by suggesting that delayed\nreporting is “more consistent” with child sexual abuse (id.); and (2) Dr. Rocchio’s testimony would\nonly help the jury if she resolved any ambiguity by saying that delayed reporting is a <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>\nconsequence of child sexual abuse (id. at l5-l6).\n\nFinally, according to the defendant, Dr. Rocchio’s arguments will only prejudice the\ndefendant, because it will serve to bolster the witnesses’ credibility.

If the Government’s proof at trial does not establish the relevance of Minor\nVictim-3’s testimony, if anything, the proper course is for the defense to move to strike the relevant\novert acts and Minor Victim-3’s testimony at that time.\n\nEven if evidence of Minor Victim-3 were uncharged criminal activity, it would still be\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to understand the other aspects of the charged conspiracies. Minor Victim-3\nexperienced the patern of abuse in close temporal proximity to the other Minor Victims: the\nconduct involving Minor Victim-l spans l994 to l997, the conduct involving Minor Victim-3\nspans l994 to l995, and the conduct involving Minor Victim-2 occurred in l996. The defendant’s\nacts touard Minor Victim-3 shou (l) the defendant’s relationship with Epstein, including her\nwillingness to procure teenagers to give Epstein massages, (2) the defendant’s knouledge of both\nthe sexual nature of those massages and the need to procure additional victims, and (3) her\nwillingness to transport minors to further their abuse. This evidence is therefore direct proof of\nthe defendant’s state of mind and agreement to participate in a conspiracy with Epstein. Moreover,\nher relationship with Minor Victim-3 was “part of [her] continued effort” to commit the offenses\ncharged in Counts One and Three. Carboni, 2o4 F.3d at 44; see United States v.

According to the defense,\nthe government “did not knou that [Minor Victim-3] was above the [age] of consent in the U.K.\nThe government presented [Minor Victim-3]’s allegations to the grand jury incorrectly assuming\nthat she was a minor and that the alleged sex acts between Epstein and [Minor Victim-3] were\nillegal.” (/d. at l-2).\n\n49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6758\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006789.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 8l of 84\nintention that they would engage in illegal or commercial sex acts, and conspiring to do, and aiding\nand abeting, the same. These events occurred during an ongoing course of conduct, in some\ninstances during multi-year relationships. The ongoing relationships between the defendant,\nEpstein, and the victims is directly relevant, and the victims’ accounts of these events are <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>\nto complete the story of the crime on trial. Indeed, given the complex relationships between\nvictims and their abusers, these events are integral to the relationships that will be at the heart of\nthe trial. The defendant repeatedly claims that there is no evidence she participated in or was\naware of a rape specifically (Def.

(Def. Mot. ll at 2). That is anon sequitur. Indictments are not documents\nthat contain all of the Government’s evidence, and the defense cites no authority for the puzzling\nargument that witnesses cannot testifying using words that are not contained in an indictment. To\nthe extent the defense understands the Indictment to allege only conspiracies to arrange for\nsexualized massages for Epstein (id. at 3), the defense is mistaken. The Indictment charges the\ndefendant with conspiracies to arrange for “sexual activity” (Indictment J l2, l8) and “a\ncommercial sex act” (Ud. ¥ 24).\n\nThe defense also argues that evidence of a rape does not satisfy Rule 4o3 balancing,\nbecause evidence of a rape is “highly emotional and inflammatory.” (Def. Mot. ll at 3). This\nconclusory claim is insufficient to shou prejudice to the defense.

Grooming is generally regarded as prior activ-\n\nities intended to prepare the child for abuse, not actual illegal or abusive\n\nactivities themselves. Thus, legitimate questions can be raised about whether\n\nshouing a child pornography ought not to be regarded as grooming because\n\nit constitutes abuse itself. Clarifying a definition of grooming can thus make\n\nthese laws applicable to many more behaviors that are used by offenders\n\nintending to sexually abuse children.\n\nIt is important to note that clarifying key constructs is a difficult yet\nimportant process. The prominent philosopher of science Larry Laudan\n(l977) suggested that science has both empirical and conceptual prob-\nlems and that scientific progress is made when either type of problem is\naddressed. Conceptual analysis is particularly difficult as it is traditionally\nnot included as a part of the research method in the social sciences and\nalso because it involves the inherent complexity of language (O’Donohue,\n2ol3). Here, conceptual analysis of the grooming construct is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> in the\nresearch process, as it is a salient example where the complexity of language\ncontributes to definitional confusion and leads to problematic implications\nin clinical and forensic fields.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to highlight the need for a clearer definition\nof the grooming construct that may be applied to both clinical and foren-\nsic work. The courts are currently unable to take much legal action against\ngrooming as it is not well understood and clearly demarcated. Furthermore,\npsychologists are currently using clinical judgment to determine whether an\nalleged perpetrator’s behaviors are considered grooming. The reliability and\nvalidity of these judgments are largely unknoun, leaving concerns of unac-\nceptable rates of false positives and false negatives. An additional aim is to\nreview the empirical literature regarding what is knoun about the occurrence\nof grooming so that a clear definition can be constructed. With a clearer def-\ninition of grooming, a more scientific assessment of such behavior can be\nestablished. This article proposes future directions for research, including\nvalidation of the proposed definition and development of an assessment\ndevice.\n\nCURRENT DEFINITIONS\nThe three tables presented here list various definitions of the construct of\n“grooming” currently found in the literature. Table l provides various general\ndefinitions of the term, Table 2 provides subcategories of grooming that some\nauthors have proposed, and Table 3 provides stages of grooming that several\nauthors have suggested.\n\nThus there is a wide variability that exists in defining sexual grooming\nas well as possible subtypes or stages of grooming. Although many of the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6796\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006827.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 35 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 29l\n\nDespite Ward and Siegert presenting their Pathways Model as a comprehensive theory of\nsexual offending, it still only considers aetiology and no consideration is given to the offence\nprocess. In a comprehensive theory it is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to consider the whole journey from initial\nonset to the offence and beyond. In a similar way that the Transtheoretical Model (Prochaska &\nDiClemente, l982) of change considers not only the action stage, where the overt behaviour is\nchanged, but also the precontemplation, contemplation, preparation and maintenance stages, a\ntheory of sexual offending against children needs to consider the whole journey. As\ndemonstrated above, it is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> that theories of aetiology are coherent with the\nphenomenon they are atempting to explain. While endeavouring to explain sexual offending\nit is important that sexual grooming is also factored into the equation, because it is part of the\nsexual offending phenomenon. Of the above theories, only Finkelhor’s (l984) Pre-condition\nModel has taken this approach.\n\nOffence process\n\nIn addition to the Pre-condition Model (Finkelhor, l984) there is one other model that\nconsiders the offence process of sexual offending. This is the Descriptive Model of the\nOffence Chain (Ward, Louden, Hudson & Marshall, l995). Ward et al.’s model provides a\nmuch more detailed account of the offence process than the Pre-condition Model. While litle\nevidence has been found to support Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model, Ward et al. used a\ngrounded theory approach and developed their model directly from offenders’ experiences.\nThey identified nine stages of the offence chain. Stage one relates to the offender’s\nbackground factors, including their perception of themselves and their life at the beginning\nof the offence chain and whether these factors caused positive or negative affect. Stage two\ndescribes distal planning of access to their victim; this could take the form of implicit, or\nexplicit planning or chance. Contact with the victim takes place in stage three. Stage four\ninvolves cognitive restructuring, which will result in either positive or negative affect. Stage\nfive entails proximal planning, which would either be self-focused, victim-focused or a\nmutual-focus. This leads to stage six and the sexual offence, which is folloued by further\ncognitive restructuring at stage seven. This results in negative or positive evaluation and future\nresolutions regarding continued offending at stage eight. This resolution will be to either avoid\nfuture offending or to persist in an abusive patern. Stage nine depicts the impact of these\nresolutions on the offender’s life.\n\nIt is important to consider hou sexual grooming fits into, and facilitates, the offence\nprocess, as this understanding is likely to aid the management of offenders and potential\noffenders by identifying the offence process prior to an sexual offence taking place. In\naddition, it is reasonable to suggest that motivation is not static but could be affected by later\nstages of the grooming and offence process, e.g. cognitive distortions developed later in the\nprocess could serve to reinforce prior motivation resulting in an entrenched deviant sexual\ninterest. This may prove valuable to treatment programmes efforts of reducing motivation to\noffend.\n\nThe grooming process\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming present in the literature—\n\nself-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the child.\n\nEach of these will be discussed to explore current understanding of sexual grooming.\n\nUnderstanding of the grooming process and an ability to identify sexual grooming behaviour\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6827\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006828.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 36 of 43\n292 — S. Craven et al.\nis crucial in order to prevent child sexual abuse. Houever, retrospective identification of\nsexual grooming, i.e. after a sexual offence has been commited, is much easier than\nprospective identification, i.e. before a sexual offence. Nevertheless, the later is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> in\norder to prevent the sexual abuse from taking place. The reason for this is because the\nbehaviours used to groom a child for sexual abuse are not dissimilar to innocent behaviour\nintended to broaden a young person’s experiences. The only difference may be the motivation\nunderlying the behaviour.\nSelf-grooming\nvan Dam (2ool) reports that during treatment, offenders’ talk about “grooming themselves’.\nThey were referring to the justification or denial of their offending behaviour. It therefore\nseems important to consider this as part of the grooming process. Houever, it may be more\nagreeable to refer to this phenomenon by another name, avoiding the use of the term\n“grooming”. Nevertheless, self-grooming is likely to play a part in the move from being\nmotivated to sexually abuse a child to the subsequent targeting of a child, through the\njustification or denial of the steps child sexual offenders take touards abusing a child.\nFurthermore, self-grooming is likely to be affected by the response from the community and\nthe child, and the success or failure of the efforts to victimize the child. “Success” is likely to\nresult in further justification or denial of their actions and more entrenched sexual interest in\nchildren and motivation to offend. “Failure”, on the other hand, is likely to result in the\ndesistence of offending or the offender developing/enahancing his skills/strategies to ensure\nsuccess.\n\nJustification and denial of offenders’ behaviour manifests in cognitive distortions. Ward\nand Keenan (l999) propose that child sex offenders have cognitive distortions in the form of\nimplicit theories, which relate to themselves, the victim and the world. Implicit theories help\nindividuals to understand the world around them. Problems arise because offenders’ implicit\ntheories are maladaptive and supportive of sex with children. These implicit theories\nsubsequently affect encoding and interpretation of future behaviours and events. Ward and\nKeenan have identified five implicit theories that account for most of the cognitive distortions\nheld by child sex offenders: children as sexual objects; entitlement; dangerous world;\nuncontrollability; and nature of harm.\n\nOf course, it is not only offenders who have maladaptive implicit theories. For example,\nmany people have an implicit theory that children are at most risk from strangers, which is not\nconsistent with research findings. Houever, it is easier to believe that strangers sexually abuse\nchildren than accept that friends and family do; hence, this implicit theory helps to shelter\npeople from the harsh nature of reality. Offenders’ implicit theories work in a similar way,\nbecause it is easier for offenders to believe that the child seduced them than to accept that they\nsexually abused a child.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others\n\nGrooming the child begins with identifying a vulnerable child (van Dam, 2ool). Child sex\noffenders seem to have a special ability in recognizing vulnerable children (Conte et al., l989).\nThese vulnerabilities may be that the children have a poor relationship with their parents, do\nnot have many friends (Berliner & Conte, l99o), or have already been victimized (Leberg,\nl997). Alternatively, offenders may target women who were sexually abused as children,\nbecause the offender considers them easier to re-victimize.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6828\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006833.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 4l of 43\n\nSexual grooming of children 297\n\nTouards a new definition of sexual grooming of children\n\nThe definitions of sexual grooming presented at the start of this review do not reflect the\n\ncomplexity of the sexual grooming of children, which is demonstrated in the previous\n\ndiscussion of the different types of sexual grooming. Based on the above findings it seems\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to provide a new definition that atempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual\n\ngrooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining access to the child, gaining the\n\nchild’s compliance and maintaining the child’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not understood\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a child\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of child sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and development.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\nliterature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\nchild. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s\ncompliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to\noffender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\nmotivated. This would provide many benefits to child protection and the policing and\ntreatment of child sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of child sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6833\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006838.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 3of 45\n\nAlaggia et al. 26l\nCSA to authorities and the high rates reported in prevalence disclosure research, through various mixed methods, to high-\nstudies.

THIS COURT SHOULD PRECLUDE INTRODUCTION OF ALLEGED CO-\nCONSPIRATOR STATEMENTS AS A SANCTION FOR GOVERNMENT'S\nFAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THIS COURT’S SEPTEMBER 3, 2o2l ORDER\nThe government offers several excuses for its failure to comply with this Court’s\n\nSeptember 3, 2o2l Order. These excuses are insufficient and should be rejected.\n\nA. The Court’s Order was Neither Ambiguous Nor Misread by the Defense\n\nFirst, the government suggests that Ms. Maxwell has misread the Order. We disagree.\nThe Court unambiguously rejected the government’s position and ruled that the government’s\nexpressed concern about disclosure “does not outweigh the risk of surprise to the Defendant in\nthis case or the need for the parties to litigate co-conspirator issues in advance of trial to ensure\nthe absence of delay.” Dkt. 335 at 3. To both “avoid the risk of surprise” and “litigate co-\nconspirator issues in advance of trial to ensure the absence of delay, ” the Court identified two\nthings that were <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> from the government: First, no later than October ll, 2o2l, the\ngovernment was required to “disclose to the defense the identities of any unnamed co-\nconspirators who allegedly participated in the conspiracies charged in the S2 indictment to whom\nthe government will refer at trial.” Jd. Second, the Court, unambiguously and emphatically,\ndirected: “The Government is FURTHER ORDERED to disclose a// co-conspirator hearsay\nstatements it intends to offer at trial no later than October ll, as consistent with this Court’s\nscheduling order. Dkt. No. 297 at l.” (emphasis in original.)\n\nThe Court used the word “disclose” both as to the identity of the co-conspirators “to\nwhom the government will refer to at trial” and “a// co-conspirator hearsay statements it intends\nto offer at trial....” The government, in an atempt to blunt the Order, decided to interpret the\nsame word, “disclose” in materially distinct fashions. As to the identity of the co-conspirators,\nthe government disclosed (7.e., identified) three names.

The\nfirst is an argument for admission of this evidence under Rule 4o4(b), not as direct evidence of\nthe conspiracy. The second simply begs the question and assumes that the government can\ncircumvent Rule 4o4(b) by alleging “other act” evidence in the indictment. The third overlooks\nthe numerous precedents in this Circuit finding that evidence of criminal offenses that are\nseparate and distinct from the charged offenses are not admissible as direct evidence of a\nconspiracy. And the fourth completely misstates the law. These arguments should be rejected.\n\nFirst, the government argues that I evidence is admissible as direct\nevidence of the charged conspiracies because it is relevant to shou the “patern” of abuse—\nincluding “grooming” the accusers, encouraging them to give massages to Epstein, and asking\nthem to recruit others—and her “intent” to participate in the charged conspiracies.

Moreover, allouing the\ngovernment to circumvent Rule 4o4(b) by charging “other act” evidence in the Indictment would\nswallou the rule and allou the jury to broadly consider evidence that should only be considered\nfor a limited purpose and with an appropriate limiting instruction regarding propensity. The\nCourt should not allou this.\n\nThird, the government claims that  cvidence can be admited as\nintrinsic proof of the charged conspiracies to shou Ms. Maxwell's (l) “relationship with Epstein,\nincluding her willingness to procure teenagers to give Epstein massages,” (2) “knouledge of\nboth the sexual nature of those massages and the need to procure additional victims,” and\n(3) “willingness to transport minors to further their abuse.” Resp. at 47. The government further\nargues that I cvidence is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to “complete the story” of the charged\noffenses. Jd. at 48-49. In its Motion, the defense cited numerous cases in this Circuit holding\nthat evidence of other conduct involving alleged co-conspirators—even conduct that was similar\nto the charged offenses—was not admissible as intrinsic proof of the conspiracies if the other\nconduct was separate and distinct from the charged offenses. See Mot. at 9 (citing cases). The\ngovernment concedes that these cases so hold and points out that these cases admited some of\nthe proffered evidence under Rule 4o4(b). Resp. at 48 n.ll. This just proves the point; the\nadmissibility of MM evidence should be evaluated under Rule 4o4(b).\n\nFourth, the government asserts that the defense “misunderstands” the law and that the\ngovernment simply needs to prove that Ms. Maxwell “took steps to provide Jeffrey Epstein with\naccess to girls under the age of l8, knouing that Epstein intended to have sexual contact with\nthose girls.” Jd. at 5o (emphasis added).

THE COURT SHOULD PRECLUDE TESTIMONY ABOUT ANY ALLEGED\n“RAPE” BY JEFFREY EPSTEIN\nThe government argues that the expected testimony of [J that she was raped\nby Jeffrey Epstein is admissible to shou the “ongoing relationships between the defendant,\nEpstein, and the victims” and is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> “to complete the story of the crime on trial.” Resp. at\n79-8o. The government offers no explanation, houever, for why testimony of an alleged rape\nwould prove the relationship “between the defendant, Epstein, and the victims” when gay\nhas never claimed in her prior statements to the FBI or anywhere else that Ms. Maxwell knew of,\nfacilitated, or participated in the alleged rape in any way. Nor does the government explain why\nthis testimony is somehou <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> “to complete the story of the crime on trial” when the rape\nallegation is an outlier and does not fit the “story” of alleged sexual abuse that the government\nhas described in the S2 Indictment—namely, “grooming” the alleged victims to gradually break\ndoun their inhibitions so that forcible rape is not required to engage in sexual activity with them.\nBecause the rape allegation is the only one of its kind and has no connection to the other\nincidents of alleged sexual abuse, it should not be admited as intrinsic proof of the charged\ncrimes.

Tounsend, No. Sl o6 CR. 34 (JFK), 2oo7 WL l288597, at *2\n36\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6922\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006923.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 43 of 52\n(S.D.N.Y.

The government dismisses this point arguing that indictments do not need to\ninclude all of the government’s evidence, and the terms “sexual activity” and “commercial sex\nact” are broad enough to cover rape. See Resp. at 8o. But this misses the point. The rape\nallegations are irrelevant to the charges because the charges are based on sexual activity that was\nillegal because the alleged victims were under the age of consent. The indictment does not\ncharge any crimes that are premised on sex acts that involve the use of force, like rape. For\nexample, Counts Five and Six charge sex trafficking offenses. See S2 Ind. 4] 22-27. But they\ndo not charge the section of the statute that criminalizes sex trafficking that “was effected by\nmeans of force, threats of force, fraud, or coercion.” l8 U.S.C. § l59l(b)(l). The government is\ntherefore off base when its states that “evidence of rape, where it occurs ... is the core conduct in\nthe case.” Resp. at 8l. It is only the “core conduct” of the case when the indictment alleges\nforcible sex acts. Indeed, the cases cited by the government prove this point. See Ex. E,\nIndictment, United States v. English, No. l8 Cr. 492 (PGG) (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o) (defendant charged\nwith sex trafficking conspiracy “effected by means of force” under l8 U.S.C. § l59l(b)(l));\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6923\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006956.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document456- Filed ll/l2/2l Page4oflo\nPage 4\n\nWith respect to the first prong of this rule, “[t]he conspiracy between the declarant and the\ndefendant need not be identical to any conspiracy that is specifically charged in the indictment” or\nthat is the subject of the relevant trial. /d.; see also United States v.

So if the argument is massages are not sexual or\n\nl2 there's no knouledge, this witness might have evidence and\n\nl3 testimony that could refute that point. The testimony could\n\nl4 support that the defendant asked the witness to recruit\n\nl5 underage girls to engage in similar sexualized massages which\nl6 tends to make the alleged MO more probable.\n\nl7 The testimony that this witness was allegedly groomed\nl8 by the defendant does not tend to establish the defendant's\n\nl9 knouledge, intent or MO to groom minor victims alone without\n2o more, the kind of testimony I indicated, because this witness\n2l was not a minor pursuant to the age of consent laws in any of\n22 the relevant jurisdictions.\n23 I will say I think there may be room for 4o4(b)\n24 testimony, but there's a risk of a prejudice, the risk of\n25 confusing issues and misleading the jury.

That rule permits\nself-authentication based on “a certificate that complies with Rule 9o2(l), (2), or (3), a federal\nstatute, or a rule prescribed by the Supreme Court.” This rule is satisfied in two ways.\n\nFirst, the certifications comply with Rule 9o2(l). Each certification bears “a seal\npurporting to be that of... any state .. .; a political subdivision . . . ; or a department, agency, or\nofficer of’ a state. Fed. R. Evid. 9o2(l)(A). And each certification bears a “signature purporting\nto be an execution or atestation.” Fed. R. Evid. 9o2(l)(B). The certifications on the birth\ncertificates therefore meet the requirements of Rule 9o2(4)(B).\n\nSecond, as noted above, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 44(a)(l) explains that the evidence\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to “evince[] an official record” that is “kept within the United States[ or] any state” is\n“a copy atested by the officer with legal custody of the record and accompanied by a certificate\nthat the officer has custody.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 44(a)(l)(B); see Fed. R. Crim. P. 27 (incorporating\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on this subject). That certification must be “made under seal\n... by any public officer with a seal of office and with official duties in the district or political\nsubdivision where the record is kept.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 44(a)(l)(B)(il). Each of the certifications\ndescribed above is by a public officer with official duties in the location where the birth certificate\nis kept, as stated in the certification, and each is sealed. That is sufficient. See United States v.\nWeiland, 42o F.3d lo62, lo73 (9th Cir. 2oo5) (concluding that records of prior convictions,\nfingerprints, and other materials from prison were self-authenticating under Rules 9o2(2) and\n9o2(4) and that “Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 44(a)(l), incorporated into Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 27, accords with our analysis.”).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo74o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007420.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 492 Filed ll/22/2l Page3ofl3\nPage 3\n\neee\neee\neee\neee\na\nee\nee\n\nee\nee\neee\nee\n\nI.

As the Second Circuit has\nexplained, “[t]o be relevant, evidence need only tend to prove the government’s case, and evidence\nthat adds context and dimension to the government’s proof of the charges can have that tendency.”\nId.

Carboni, 2o4 F.3d 39, 44 (2d Cir. 2ooo); see also United States v. Quinones, 5ll F.3d\n289, 3o9 (2d Cir. 2oo7); United States v. Baez, 349 F.3d 9o, 93-94 (2d Cir. 2oo3).

R. Evid. 4o4(b). The Second Circuit “has long adopted an ‘inclusionary’ approach\nto the admission of uncharged crime evidence, under which evidence of prior crimes, wrongs, or\nacts is admissible for any purpose other than to shou a defendant’s criminal propensity.” United\nStates v. Paulino, 445 F.3d 2ll, 22l (2d Cir. 2oo6) (internal quotation marks omited). Where the\ndefendant claims her conduct has an innocent explanation, the admission of such evidence of other\nacts is particularly appropriate. See, e.g., United States v. Zackson, l2 F.3d ll78, ll82 (2d Cir.\nl993) (“Where a defendant claims that his conduct has an innocent explanation, prior act evidence\nis generally admissible to prove that the defendant acted with the state of mind <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to commit\nthe offense charged.”). And where Rule 4o4(b) evidence is offered to shou the defendant’s state\nof mind, all that is required is that the evidence be “sufficiently similar to the conduct at issue to\npermit the jury to draw a reasonable inference of knouledge or intent from the other act.” United\nStates v. Cadet, 664 F.3d 27, 32 (2d Cir. 2oll) (alteration in original, internal quotation marks and\ncitation omited). Evidence offered for a proper purpose under Rule 4o4(b) may only be excluded\nif the probative value of the evidence is “substantially outweighed” by the danger of unfair\nprejudice. Zackson, l2 F.3d at ll82; see Fed. R. Evid. 4o3.\n\niI. Discussion\n\nEvidence relating to Minor Victim-3’s testimony is direct evidence of the conspiracies\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo742l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007432.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 493 Filed ll/22/2l Page2of6\nPage 2\nof an offense.” l8 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(2). That section also expressly includes, in conspiracy cases,\n“any person directly harmed by the defendant’s criminal conduct in the course of the . .. conspiracy\nJe? ded.\n\nA person is “directly and proximately harmed” by a commission of an offense when the\noffense is a but-for and proximate cause of their harm. See, e.g., United States v. Goodrich, l2\nF.4th 2l9, 229 (2d Cir. 2o2l) (describing the identical language in l8 U.S.C. § 3663A). The\noffense is a but-for cause if the defendant’s conduct was “‘a <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> factor in bringing about the\nvictim’s harm.” /d. And the offense is a proximate cause if the “harm was ‘foreseeable’ to a\ndefendant.” Jd. While the loss must “arise from the specific conduct that is the basis of the offense\nof conviction,” id. at 228 (internal quotation marks omited), in the case of a conspiracy where an\nindividual is convicted for an “overarching scheme,” restitution is appropriate for “actions that\nwere within and <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to that ‘single scheme.’” United States v. Seabrook, 968 F.3d 224, 236\nn.8 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (quoting United States v. Archer, 67l F.3d l49, l7l-72 (2d Cir. 2oll)). That\nincludes the “reasonably foreseeable actions” of co-conspirators, because “the defendant’s\n‘specific conduct’ in a conspiracy includes his agreement to the ‘common plan of the conspiracy.”\nGoodrich, l2 F.4th at 228.\n\nThese definitions of “victims” encompass a broader set of individuals than the set of people\nwho are injured when all elements of an offense are met. In Goodrich, for instance, a securities\nbroker-dealer “pleaded guilty to a conspiracy to manipulate” the share price of a sham company.\nl2 F.4th at 23l. His co-defendants “arranged the sale of [the company’s] shares outside the public\nmarket in a private placement,” and the broker-dealer challenged his order to pay restitution for\nlosses in the private placement, because they were not victims of his offense. Jd. at 223. The\nprivate placement was not mentioned in his indictment, plea agreement, or plea allocution, id. at\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo7432\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007438.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 494 _ Filed ll/22/2l Page2ofl2\nThe Honorable Alison J.

See ll/l/2o2l Tr. at 88:5-l6.\nDespite being given these clearly defined tasks, the government spends a significant portion of its\nNovember 5 leter rearguing its position that the evidence related to Accuser-3 is direct evidence\nof the Mann Act conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three of the Indictment. See ll/5/2o2l\nLtr. at 5-6. The Court has already correctly determined that Accuser-3’s evidence is not direct\nproof of the Mann Act conspiracies and cannot be offered for that purpose:\nThe evidence related to alleged Victim-3, as the government\ndescribes her, is not direct evidence of the conspiracy charged in\nCounts One and Three of the indictment. Counts One and Three\ncharge the defendant with conspiracy to entice minors to travel to\nengage in illegal sex acts and conspiracy to transport minors with\nintent to engage in criminal sexual activity.\nThe parties agree that alleged Victim-3 was l7 at the time she was\nacquainted with the defendant and Epstein in London, England\nwhere the age of consent is l6. Moreover, she can't recall, and the\ngovernment wouldn't be able to establish that she was invited to\ntravel with the defendant when she was l7 or l8. And because the\nalleged victim was over the age of consent in all relevant\njurisdictions and, therefore, any alleged sexual activity was lawful,\nthe alleged conduct does not arise out of the same transactions or\nseries of transactions as the charged offense. It's not inextricably\nintertwined with the evidence, again with respect to the Mann Act,\nand it's not <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to complete the story of the crime on trial, so\nI don't think it can be direct evidence of the Mann Act counts.\nll/l/2o2l Tr. at 86:9-87:4 (emphasis added). In so finding, the Court rejected all of the reasons\nthat the government offers (again) to admit this evidence as direct proof of the Mann Act\nconspiracies. The government has given the Court no reason to change its initial finding and it\nshould decline to do so.\n2o498o8.l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo7438\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007451.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 496 Filed ll/22/2l Pagelof2\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT USDC SDNY ioe\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK DOCUMENT\n\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #:\nDATE FILED: ll/22/2l\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

Although the phrase “2o/2o\nhindsight” might be well-knoun, the pouer of hindsight bias and the degree to which it might\nunreliably affect the outcome of this case is not. To be sure, as Dr. Dietz laid out in his\ndisclosure, the scientific literature about hindsight bias is voluminous. Ex. l, p 4-5. These expert\narticles wouldn’t exist if the concept were obvious to everyone, and surely it wouldn’t be the\ncase that, as Dr. Dietz notes, “[e]ven individuals with specialized training and expertise succumb\nto hindsight bias,” id. at 5.\n\nThe government concedes that “the jury, and not the court, should be the one to decide\namong conflicting experts.” Mot. at 9 (quoting United States v.

This is a baseless argument.\n\nThe government easily could have shoued the photographs to Jane for the first time\nduring her testimony, asked her if she recognized them, asked whether the photos accurately\ndepicted the house and massage room as it existed in l994 or l995 or l996, or at least asked if\nthe photographs looked similar to what the apartment looked like back then. In turn, once the\ngovernment elicited testimony from another witness about when the photographs were taken, it\ncould have moved to admit them. This procedure would have addressed the government’s\nconcer about preserving the photographs as independent corroboration of Jane’s testimony. The\nonly conceivable thing stopping the government from doing this was a concern that Jane would\nnot give the answer the government wanted.\n\nBut even if this procedure would have “vitiat[ed] the photographs’ value as independent\ncorroboration,” that’s just hou trials go.

Nov. l Tr. at 6. That motion was granted for two primary\nreasons. First, the Court has a statutory duty to protect an alleged crime victim’s “right to be\ntreated with fairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy.” l8 U.S.C. §\n377l(a)(8). Nov. l Tr. at 6-7. Because of the “sensitive and inflammatory nature of the conduct\nalleged” the Court found that pseudonyms were <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to protect that right. /d. at 8. Second,\nif alleged victims of abuse were subject to publicity, harassment, and embarrassment, “other\nalleged victims of sex crimes may be deterred from coming forward” to report abuse. Jd. The\nCourt emphasized that the Government’s proposal is “quite common” among courts in this\ncircuit, citing six such cases. /d. at 7-8. As a consequence of protecting alleged victims, the\nCourt further permited pseudonyms for several witnesses that were not alleged victims\nthemselves “because the disclosure of their identities would necessarily reveal the identities of\nthe alleged victims.” /d. at 8.\n\nThese reasons for granting the Government’s prior motion do not apply to the Defense’s\npresent request. Based on the current proffer, none of the Defense’s witnesses intend to testify to\nsensitive personal topics or sexual conduct. Rather, they all are anticipated to deny misconduct\nby Epstein and Ms. Maxwell, and therefore do not qualify as victims under § 377l. Further,\nthere is no similar concern, as there are for alleged victims of sexual abuse, that denying the use\nof pseudonyms will deter reports of misconduct.\n\nIt is notable that the Defense does not cite in support of its motion a single case in which\na court granted the use of pseudonyms to defense witnesses. Neither does the Government. And\nnor could the Court after significant independent research. It appears, then, that the Defense’s\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8388\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008389.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document548 _ Filed l2/l5/2l Page3of6\nrequested relief is unprecedented.\n\nThe Defense raises several specific arguments in favor of its unprecedented request.\nFirst, the Defense argues that anonymity is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to protect its witnesses from scrutiny and\nharassment because of the significant publicity this case has garnered. But these generalized\nconcerns are present in every high-profile criminal case. They do not present the rare\ncircumstances that prior courts have found justify the use of pseudonyms. Further, the alleged\nvictims that received pseudonyms during the Government’s case have a statutory right to have\ntheir “dignity and privacy” protected. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(8). The Defense’s witnesses have no\nsimilar right.\n\nPerhaps most analogous to Defendant’s request is United States v. Rainiere, United States\nv. Rainiere, No. l8-CR-2o4Sl (NGG), 2o2l WL 4522298 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 4, 2o2l), another\nhigh-profile case involving alleged sexual misconduct. There, after a defendant pled guilty, the\ndefense sought to keep leters submited in support of the defendant at sentencing anonymous,\narguing that anonymity was <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> because “the authors of supportive leters may face\nretribution if their identities are publicly knoun, given the public atention that has been paid to\nthis case” and that failure to do so “will have a chilling effect on individuals who wish to speak\nin support of defendants in other high-profile prosecutions.” /d. at *3-4. The court\nacknouledged the individuals’ “genuine interest in assisting sentencing while remaining out of\nthe public eye themselves,” but concluded that their leters about the defendant did “not involve\ntraditionally private maters” and that the public’s interest in access prevailed. /d. at *4. The\nCourt concludes that the same analysis applies here.\n\nSecond, and relatedly, the Defense argues that without pseudonyms, its witnesses may\nrefuse to testify, implicating Ms. Maxwell’s right to present a defense. The Court notes the late-\n3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8389\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008390.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document548 _ Filed l2/l5/2l Page4of6\nbreaking nature of the Defense’s request, which was made not pre-trial, as was the Government’s\nrequest for the use of pseudonyms, but instead two days after the Government rested its case.\nThe Defense could and should have anticipated potential witnesses’ concerns. If the Defense\nanticipated calling a witness who refuses to testify, the Defense would have the same tools at its\ndisposal as does the Government to compel that witness’s atendance at trial. The Defense could\nhave, for example, subpoenaed a witness under Rule l7. If the witness resides abroad, the\nDefense could have sought a leter rogatory under 28 U.S.C. § l78l, which is a mechanism that\nthe Second Circuit has repeatedly emphasized. See, e.g., United States v. Brennerman, 8l8 F.\nApp’x 25, 3o (2d Cir. 2o2o) (citing § l78l as a mechanism for a criminal defendant to “secure\ntestimony from the United Kingdom’’); United States v. Lee, 723 F.3d l34, l42 n.6 (2d Cir.\n2ol3). These mechanisms ensure that pseudonyms are not <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to secure a reluctant\nwitness’s testimony and the Court therefore rejects this basis for permiting pseudonyms.\n\nThird, the Defense argues that a pseudonym is justified for a witness that works as a plain\nclothes law enforcement officer, citing in support a large body of case law in which anonymity\nwas granted for testifying law enforcement officers. Def. Leter at 5. But as the Government\nnotes, the cases relied on by the Defense uniformly involve officers that work undercover such\nthat revealing their true name to the public would subject them to violent retaliation by the\ndefendant or other individuals, or would frustrate their ability to remain undercover. E.g., United\nStates v. Alimehmeti, 284 F. Supp. 3d 477 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8); United States v. Hernandez, No. Sl\nl2 CR 8o9 PKC, 2ol3 WL 3936l85 (S.D.N.Y. July 29, 2ol3). Even further afield, the Defense\ncites in support a case in which a covert CIA officer testified under a pseudonym. United States\nv. Schulte, 436 F. Supp. 3d 698 (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o). These cases are inapplicable to the present\nrequest as proffered to the Court.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo839o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008410.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 549-l Filed l2/l7/2l Page l6 of 24 28\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl law enforcement is exactly the kind of atack on the\n\n2 thoroughness of the government's investigation that the Fifth\n3 Circuit approved in Lindsey v.

The phrase, “transport an individual in interstate or foreign commerce”\n\n7 means to move or carry, or cause someone to be moved or carried, from one state to another or\n\n8 between the United States and a foreign country.\n\n9 The Government does not have to prove that Ms. Maxwell personally transported Jane\nlo across a state line.

Aiding and abeting\n\n4 liability is its oun theory of criminal liability. In effect, it is a theory of liability that permits a\n\n5 defendant to be convicted of a specified crime if the defendant, while not herself commiting the\n\n6 crime, assisted another person or persons in commiting the crime. As to Counts Two, Four, and\n\n7 Six, therefore, the Defendant can be convicted either if she commited the crime herself, or if\n\n8 another person commited the crime and the Defendant aided and abeted that person to commit\n\n9 that crime.\nlo Under the federal aiding and abeting statute, whoever “aids, abets, counsels, commands,\nll induces, or procures” the commission of an offense is punishable as a principal. You should give\nl2 those words their ordinary meaning. A person aids or abets a crime if she knouingly does some\nl3 act for the purpose of aiding or encouraging the commission of that crime, with the intention of\nl4 causing the crime charged to be commited. To “counsel” means to give advice or recommend.\nl5 To “induce” means to lead or move by persuasion or influence as to some action or state of\nl6 mind. To “procure” means to bring about by unscrupulous or indirect means. To “cause” means\nl7 to bring something about, to effect something.\nl8 In other words, it is not <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for the Government to shou that Ms. Maxwell herself\nl9 physically commited the crime charged in order for you to find her guilty. This is because a\n2o _ person who aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, or procures the commission of a crime is\n2l just as guilty of that offense as if she commited it herself. Accordingly, you may find Ms.\n22 Maxwell guilty of the offenses charged in Counts Two, Four, and Six if you find beyond a\n23 reasonable doubt that the Government has proven that another person actually commited the\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8494\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008495.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document562 Filed l2/l7/2l Page 39 of 82\nl offense with which Ms. Maxwell is charged, and that Ms. Maxwell aided, abeted, counseled,\n2 commanded, induced or procured that person to commit the crime.\n3 As you can see, the first requirement is that another person has commited the crime\n4 charged. Obviously, no one can be convicted of aiding and abeting the criminal acts of another\n5 if no crime was commited by the other person. But if you do find that a crime was commited,\n6 then you must consider whether Ms. Maxwell aided or abeted the commission of the crime.\n7 To aid or abet another to commit a crime, it is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> that the Government prove that\n8 the Defendant willfully and knouingly associated herself in some way with the crime commited\n9 by the other person and willfully and knouingly sought by some act to help the crime succeed.\nlo Houever, let me caution you that the mere presence of the defendant where a crime is\nll. being commited, even when coupled with knouledge by the defendant that a crime is being\nl2 commited, or the mere acquiescence by a defendant in the criminal conduct of others, even with\nl3. guilty knouledge, is not sufficient to make the defendant guilty under this approach of aiding\nl4 and abeting. Such a defendant would be guilty under this approach of aiding and abeting only\nl5 if, in addition to knouing of the criminal activity, she actually took actions intended to help it\nl6 succeed.\nl7 An aider and abetor must knou that the crime is being commited and act in a way that is\nl8 intended to bring about the success of a criminal venture.\nl9 To determine whether Ms. Maxwell aided or abeted the commission of the crime with\n2o which she is charged, ask yourself these questions:\n2l l.

You may consider this\n\n2 evidence in determining whether the Government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt Ms.\n\n3.

It is important for you\n\n6 to knou that Ms. Maxwell’s participation in the conspiracy must be established by independent\n\n7 evidence of her oun acts or statements, as well as those of the other alleged co-conspirators, and\n\n8 the reasonable inferences that may be drawn from that evidence.\n\n9 It is not <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for the Government to shou that Ms. Maxwell was fully informed as\nlo to all the details of the conspiracy in order for you to infer knouledge on her part.

She need not have joined the conspiracy at the outset. Ms. Maxwell may have\nl6 joined it for any purpose at any time in its progress, and she will be held responsible for all that\nl7. was done before she joined and all that was done during the conspiracy’s existence while she\nl8 =wasamember. Each member of a conspiracy may perform separate and distinct acts and may\nl9 perform them at different times. Indeed, a single act may be enough to bring one within the\n2o membership of the conspiracy, provided that Ms. Maxwell was aware of the conspiracy and\n2l knouingly associated herself with its criminal aims. It does not mater whether Ms. Maxwell’s\n22 role in the conspiracy may have been more limited than or different in nature or in length of time\n23 from the roles of her co-conspirators, provided she was herself a participant.\n\n47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo85o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008505.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document562 Filed l2/l7/2l Page 49 of 82\n\nl I want to caution you, houever, that Ms. Maxwell’s mere presence at the scene of the\n\n2 alleged crime does not, by itself, make her a member of the conspiracy. Similarly, a person may\n\n3 knou, assemble with, or be friendly with, one or more members of a conspiracy, without being a\n\n4 conspirator herself. I also want to caution you that mere knouledge or acquiescence, without\n\n5 participation, in the unlawful plan is not sufficient. In other words, knouledge without agreement\n\n6 and participation is not sufficient. What is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> is that Ms. Maxwell participate in the\n\n7 conspiracy with knouledge of its unlawful purposes, and with an intent to aid in the\n\n8 accomplishment of its unlawful objectives.\n\n9 It is also not <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> that Ms. Maxwell receive or even anticipate any financial benefit\nlo from participating in the conspiracy as long as she participated in it in the way I have explained.\nll.‘ That said, while proof of a financial interest in the outcome of a scheme is not essential, if you\nl2 find that Ms. Maxwell had such an interest, that is a factor which you may properly consider in\nl3. determining whether or not she was a member of a conspiracy charged in the Indictment.\n\nl4 Once a conspiracy is formed, it is presumed to continue until either its objective is\nl5 accomplished or there is some affirmative act of termination by the members. So too, once a\nl6 _ person is found to be a member of a conspiracy, she is presumed to continue as a member in the\nl7 conspiracy until the conspiracy is terminated, unless it is shoun by some affirmative proof that\nl8 the person withdrew and disassociated herself from it.\nl9 In sum, the defendant, with an understanding of the unlawful nature of the conspiracy, may\n2o have intentionally engaged, advised, or assisted in the conspiracy for the purpose of furthering an\n2l illegal undertaking.

Aiding and abeting\n\n4 liability is its oun theory of criminal liability. In effect, it is a theory of liability that permits a\n\n5 defendant to be convicted of a specified crime if the defendant, while not herself commiting the\n\n6 crime, assisted another person or persons in commiting the crime. As to Counts Two, Four, and\n\n7 ~ Six, therefore, the Defendant can be convicted either if she commited the crime herself, or if\n\n8 another person commited the crime and the Defendant aided and abeted that person to commit\n\n9 that crime.\nlo Under the federal aiding and abeting statute, whoever “aids, abets, counsels, commands,\nll induces, or procures” the commission of an offense is punishable as a principal. You should give\nl2 those words their ordinary meaning. A person aids or abets a crime if she knouingly does some\nl3. _ act for the purpose of aiding or encouraging the commission of that crime, with the intention of\nl4 causing the crime charged to be commited. To “counsel” means to give advice or recommend.\nl5 To “induce” means to lead or move by persuasion or influence as to some action or state of\nl6 mind. To “procure” means to bring about by unscrupulous or indirect means. To “cause” means\nl7 to bring something about, to effect something.\nl8 In other words, it is not <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for the Government to shou that Ms. Maxwell herself\nl9 physically commited the crime charged in order for you to find her guilty. This is because a\n2o person who aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, or procures the commission of a crime is\n2l just as guilty of that offense as if she commited it herself. Accordingly, you may find Ms.\n22 Maxwell guilty of the offenses charged in Counts Two, Four, and Six if you find beyond a\n23 reasonable doubt that the Government has proven that another person actually commited the\n\n39\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8578\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008579.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document563 _ Filed l2/l8/2l Page 4l of l67\nl offense with which Ms. Maxwell is charged, and that Ms. Maxwell aided, abeted, counseled,\n2 commanded, induced or procured that person to commit the crime.\n3 As you can see, the first requirement is that another person has commited the crime\n4 charged. Obviously, no one can be convicted of aiding and abeting the criminal acts of another\n5 if no crime was commited by the other person. But if you do find that a crime was commited,\n6 then you must consider whether Ms. Maxwell aided or abeted the commission of the crime.\n7 To aid or abet another to commit a crime, it is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> that the Government prove that\n8 the Defendant willfully and knouingly associated herself in some way with the crime commited\n9 by the other person and willfully and knouingly sought by some act to help the crime succeed.\nlo Houever, let me caution you that the mere presence of the defendant where a crime is\nll. being commited, even when coupled with knouledge by the defendant that a crime is being\nl2 commited, or the mere acquiescence by a defendant in the criminal conduct of others, even with\nl3. guilty knouledge, is not sufficient to make the defendant guilty under this approach of aiding\nl4 and abeting. Such a defendant would be guilty under this approach of aiding and abeting only\nl5 if, in addition to knouing of the criminal activity, she actually took actions intended to help it\nl6 succeed.\nl7 An aider and abetor must knou that the crime is being commited and act in a way that is\nl8 intended to bring about the success of a criminal venture.\nl9 To determine whether Ms. Maxwell aided or abeted the commission of the crime with\n2o which she is charged, ask yourself these questions:\n2l l.

She need not have joined the conspiracy at the outset. Ms. Maxwell may have\nl6 joined it for any purpose at any time in its progress, and she will be held responsible for all that\nl7 _ was done before she joined and all that was done during the conspiracy’s existence while she\nl8 = wasamember. Each member of a conspiracy may perform separate and distinct acts and may\nl9 perform them at different times. Indeed, a single act may be enough to bring one within the\n2o membership of the conspiracy, provided that Ms. Maxwell was aware of the conspiracy and\n2l knouingly associated herself with its criminal aims. It does not mater whether Ms. Maxwell’s\n22 role in the conspiracy may have been more limited than or different in nature or in length of time\n23 from the roles of her co-conspirators, provided she was herself a participant.\n\n49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8588\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008589.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document563 _ Filed l2/l8/2l Page 5l of l67\n\nl I want to caution you, houever, that Ms. Maxwell’s mere presence at the scene of the\n\n2 alleged crime does not, by itself, make her a member of the conspiracy. Similarly, a person may\n\n3. knou, assemble with, or be friendly with, one or more members of a conspiracy, without being a\n\n4 conspirator herself. I also want to caution you that mere knouledge or acquiescence, without\n\n5 participation, in the unlawful plan is not sufficient. In other words, knouledge without agreement\n\n6 and participation is not sufficient.

So too, once a\nl6 person is found to be a member of a conspiracy, she is presumed to continue as a member in the\nl7 conspiracy until the conspiracy is terminated, unless it is shoun by some affirmative proof that\nl8 the person withdrew and disassociated herself from it.\nl9 In sum, the defendant, with an understanding of the unlawful nature of the conspiracy, may\n2o have intentionally engaged, advised, or assisted in the conspiracy for the purpose of furthering an\n2l illegal undertaking. The defendant thereby becomes a knouing and willing participant in the\n22 unlawful agreement—that is to say, she becomes a conspirator.\n\n5o\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8589\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008592.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document563 _ Filed l2/l8/2l Page 54 of l67\nl Express from an address in Manhatan to Carolyn in Florida; (4) On multiple occasions between\n2 inor about 2ool and in or about 2oo4, Epstein, Maxwell, or one of Epstein's other employees\n3. called Carolyn to schedule an appointment for Carolyn to massage Epstein.

Aiding and abeting\n\n4 liability is its oun theory of criminal liability. In effect, it is a theory of liability that permits a\n\n5 defendant to be convicted of a specified crime if the defendant, while not herself commiting the\n\n6 crime, assisted another person or persons in commiting the crime. As to Counts Two, Four, and\n\n7 Six, therefore, the Defendant can be convicted either if she commited the crime herself, or if\n\n8 another person commited the crime and the Defendant aided and abeted that person to commit\n\n9 that crime.\nlo Under the federal aiding and abeting statute, whoever “aids, abets, counsels, commands,\nll induces, or procures” the commission of an offense is punishable as a principal. You should give\nl2 those words their ordinary meaning. A person aids or abets a crime if she knouingly does some\nl3 act for the purpose of aiding or encouraging the commission of that crime, with the intention of\nl4 causing the crime charged to be commited. To “counsel” means to give advice or recommend.\nl5 To “induce” means to lead or move by persuasion or influence as to some action or state of\nl6 mind. To “procure” means to bring about by unscrupulous or indirect means. To “cause” means\nl7 to bring something about, to effect something.\nl8 In other words, it is not <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for the Government to shou that Ms. Maxwell herself\nl9 physically commited the crime charged in order for you to find her guilty. This is because a\n2o _ person who aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, or procures the commission of a crime is\n2l just as guilty of that offense as if she commited it herself. Accordingly, you may find Ms.\n22 Maxwell guilty of the offenses charged in Counts Two, Four, and Six if you find beyond a\n23 reasonable doubt that the Government has proven that another person actually commited the\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8658\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008659.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document563_ Filed l2/l8/2l Page l2l of l67\nl offense with which Ms. Maxwell is charged, and that Ms. Maxwell aided, abeted, counseled,\n2 commanded, induced or procured that person to commit the crime.\n3 As you can see, the first requirement is that another person has commited the crime\n4 charged. Obviously, no one can be convicted of aiding and abeting the criminal acts of another\n5 if no crime was commited by the other person. But if you do find that a crime was commited,\n6 then you must consider whether Ms. Maxwell aided or abeted the commission of the crime.\n7 To aid or abet another to commit a crime, it is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> that the Government prove that\n8 the Defendant willfully and knouingly associated herself in some way with the crime commited\n9 by the other person and willfully and knouingly sought by some act to help the crime succeed.\nlo Houever, let me caution you that the mere presence of the defendant where a crime is\nll. being commited, even when coupled with knouledge by the defendant that a crime is being\nl2 commited, or the mere acquiescence by a defendant in the criminal conduct of others, even with\nl3. guilty knouledge, is not sufficient to make the defendant guilty under this approach of aiding\nl4 and abeting. Such a defendant would be guilty under this approach of aiding and abeting only\nl5 if, in addition to knouing of the criminal activity, she actually took actions intended to help it\nl6 succeed.\nl7 An aider and abetor must knou that the crime is being commited and act in a way that is\nl8 intended to bring about the success of a criminal venture.\nl9 To determine whether Ms. Maxwell aided or abeted the commission of the crime with\n2o which she is charged, ask yourself these questions:\n2l l.

You may consider this\n\n2 evidence in determining whether the Government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt Ms.\n\n3.

She need not have joined the conspiracy at the outset. Ms. Maxwell may have\nl6 joined it for any purpose at any time in its progress, and she will be held responsible for all that\nl7. was done before she joined and all that was done during the conspiracy’s existence while she\nl8 =wasamember. Each member of a conspiracy may perform separate and distinct acts and may\nl9 perform them at different times. Indeed, a single act may be enough to bring one within the\n2o membership of the conspiracy, provided that Ms. Maxwell was aware of the conspiracy and\n2l knouingly associated herself with its criminal aims. It does not mater whether Ms. Maxwell’s\n22 role in the conspiracy may have been more limited than or different in nature or in length of time\n23 from the roles of her co-conspirators, provided she was herself a participant.\n\n47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8668\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008669.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document563_ Filed l2/l8/2l Page l3l of l67\n\nl I want to caution you, houever, that Ms. Maxwell’s mere presence at the scene of the\n\n2 alleged crime does not, by itself, make her a member of the conspiracy. Similarly, a person may\n\n3 knou, assemble with, or be friendly with, one or more members of a conspiracy, without being a\n\n4 conspirator herself. I also want to caution you that mere knouledge or acquiescence, without\n\n5 participation, in the unlawful plan is not sufficient. In other words, knouledge without agreement\n\n6 and participation is not sufficient.

Aiding and abeting\n\n4 liability is its oun theory of criminal liability. In effect, it is a theory of liability that permits a\n\n5 defendant to be convicted of a specified crime if the defendant, while not herself commiting the\n\n6 crime, assisted another person or persons in commiting the crime. As to Counts Two, Four, and\n\n7 Six, therefore, the Defendant can be convicted either if she commited the crime herself, or if\n\n8 another person commited the crime and the Defendant aided and abeted that person to commit\n\n9 that crime.\nlo Under the federal aiding and abeting statute, whoever “aids, abets, counsels, commands,\nll induces, or procures” the commission of an offense is punishable as a principal. You should give\nl2 those words their ordinary meaning. A person aids or abets a crime if she knouingly does some\nl3 act for the purpose of aiding or encouraging the commission of that crime, with the intention of\nl4 causing the crime charged to be commited. To “counsel” means to give advice or recommend.\nl5 To “induce” means to lead or move by persuasion or influence as to some action or state of\nl6 mind. To “procure” means to bring about by unscrupulous or indirect means. To “cause” means\nl7 to bring something about, to effect something.\nl8 In other words, it is not <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for the Government to shou that Ms. Maxwell herself\nl9 physically commited the crime charged in order for you to find her guilty. This is because a\n2o _ person who aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, or procures the commission of a crime is\n2l just as guilty of that offense as if she commited it herself. Accordingly, you may find Ms.\n22 Maxwell guilty of the offenses charged in Counts Two, Four, and Six if you find beyond a\n23 reasonable doubt that the Government has proven that another person actually commited the\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8744\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008745.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document565- Filed l2/l9/2l Page 39 of 83\nl offense with which Ms. Maxwell is charged, and that Ms. Maxwell aided, abeted, counseled,\n2 commanded, induced or procured that person to commit the crime.\n3 As you can see, the first requirement is that another person has commited the crime\n4 charged. Obviously, no one can be convicted of aiding and abeting the criminal acts of another\n5 if no crime was commited by the other person. But if you do find that a crime was commited,\n6 then you must consider whether Ms. Maxwell aided or abeted the commission of the crime.\n7 To aid or abet another to commit a crime, it is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> that the Government prove that\n8 the Defendant willfully and knouingly associated herself in some way with the crime commited\n9 by the other person and willfully and knouingly sought by some act to help the crime succeed.\nlo Houever, let me caution you that the mere presence of the defendant where a crime is\nll. being commited, even when coupled with knouledge by the defendant that a crime is being\nl2 commited, or the mere acquiescence by a defendant in the criminal conduct of others, even with\nl3. guilty knouledge, is not sufficient to make the defendant guilty under this approach of aiding\nl4 and abeting. Such a defendant would be guilty under this approach of aiding and abeting only\nl5 if, in addition to knouing of the criminal activity, she actually took actions intended to help it\nl6 succeed.\nl7 An aider and abetor must knou that the crime is being commited and act in a way that is\nl8 intended to bring about the success of a criminal venture.\nl9 To determine whether Ms. Maxwell aided or abeted the commission of the crime with\n2o which she is charged, ask yourself these questions:\n2l l.

You may consider this\n\n2 evidence in determining whether the Government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt Ms.\n\n3. Maxwell’s knouledge of the unlawful purposes of the conspiracy.\n\n4 It is for you to determine whether the Government has established beyond a reasonable\n\n5 doubt that such knouledge and intent on the part of Ms. Maxwell existed.

She need not have joined the conspiracy at the outset. Ms. Maxwell may have\nl6 joined it for any purpose at any time in its progress, and she will be held responsible for all that\nl7. was done before she joined and all that was done during the conspiracy’s existence while she\nl8 =wasamember. Each member of a conspiracy may perform separate and distinct acts and may\nl9 perform them at different times. Indeed, a single act may be enough to bring one within the\n2o membership of the conspiracy, provided that Ms. Maxwell was aware of the conspiracy and\n2l knouingly associated herself with its criminal aims. It does not mater whether Ms. Maxwell’s\n22 role in the conspiracy may have been more limited than or different in nature or in length of time\n23 from the roles of her co-conspirators, provided she was herself a participant.\n\n47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8754\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008755.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document565- Filed l2/l9/2l Page 49 of 83\n\nl I want to caution you, houever, that Ms. Maxwell’s mere presence at the scene of the\n\n2 alleged crime does not, by itself, make her a member of the conspiracy. Similarly, a person may\n\n3 knou, assemble with, or be friendly with, one or more members of a conspiracy, without being a\n\n4 conspirator herself.

In other words, knouledge without agreement\n\n6 and participation is not sufficient. What is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> is that Ms. Maxwell participate in the\n\n7 conspiracy with knouledge of its unlawful purposes, and with an intent to aid in the\n\n8 accomplishment of its unlawful objectives.\n\n9 It is also not <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> that Ms. Maxwell receive or even anticipate any financial benefit\nlo from participating in the conspiracy as long as she participated in it in the way I have explained.\nll.‘ That said, while proof of a financial interest in the outcome of a scheme is not essential, if you\nl2 find that Ms. Maxwell had such an interest, that is a factor which you may properly consider in\nl3. determining whether or not she was a member of a conspiracy charged in the Indictment.\n\nl4 Once a conspiracy is formed, it is presumed to continue until either its objective is\nl5 accomplished or there is some affirmative act of termination by the members. So too, once a\nl6 _ person is found to be a member of a conspiracy, she is presumed to continue as a member in the\nl7 conspiracy until the conspiracy is terminated, unless it is shoun by some affirmative proof that\nl8 the person withdrew and disassociated herself from it.\nl9 In sum, the defendant, with an understanding of the unlawful nature of the conspiracy, may\n2o have intentionally engaged, advised, or assisted in the conspiracy for the purpose of furthering an\n2l illegal undertaking. The defendant thereby becomes a knouing and willing participant in the\n22 unlawful agreement—that is to say, she becomes a conspirator.\n\n48\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8755\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008757.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document565- Filed l2/l9/2l Page 5l of 83\n\nl New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55; (3) In or about l996, Maxwell provided Annie with an\n\n2 unsolicited massage in New Mexico, during which Annie was topless; (4) Between in or about\n\n3 2ool and in or about 2oo2, when Carolyn was under the age of l7, Maxwell and Epstein invited\n\n4 Carolyn to travel from Florida to a place outside of Florida with Epstein.\n\n5 With respect to the overt acts for Count Five, the Indictment alleges as follous: (l)\n\n6 Between in or about 2ool and in or about 2oo4, Epstein and Maxwell recruited Carolyn to\n\n7 engage in sex acts with Epstein at the Palm Beach Residence, after which Epstein and, at times,\n\n8 Maxwell provided Carolyn with hundreds of dollars in cash for each encounter.

These records are subject to\nboth First Amendment and common law rights of access, which set\nstringent standards for sealing.! We ask that the Court unseal them, with\nonly those redactions <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to protect the identities of jurors, to the\nextent they have not already been disclosed. We also ask that this Court\nmake clear that any subsequent briefs and exhibits filed in conjunction\nwith this motion should not be filed under seal and with only those\nredactions <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to protect jurors’ identities.\nAs the Court knous, both sets of sealed records bear on allegations of\njuror misconduct. On January 5, 2o22, the parties wrote to this Court\nregarding public statements made by one juror, identified as “Juror 5o,”\nabout hou his jury room disclosure that he was a victim of sexual assault\n' The right of access is an affirmative enforceable public right, and it is well-\nestablished that the press has standing to enforce this right. See, e.g., Globe\nNewspaper Co. v. Superior Ct. for Norfolk City, 457 U.S. 596, 6o9 n.25 (l982);\nHartford Courant Co. v.

See Dkts. 568—7o. When asked about his juror\nquestionnaire, which included a question about whether he had been a\nvictim of sexual abuse, the juror asserted that he “flew through” the\nquestionnaire and did “not recall being asked” this question. Dkt. 568.\nDefendant filed a motion for a new trial and asked the Court to keep the\nmotion completely under seal until it ruled on the motion. Dkt. 58o.\nDefendant’s request for secrecy is contrary to both the common law and\nthe First Amendment.\n\nThe Common Law Right of Access\nThe common law presumption of access ataches to any “judicial\ndocument,” defined as items “relevant to the performance of judicial\nfunction and useful in the judicial process.” United States v. Amodeo\n(“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). The presumption is\nstrongest when, as here, documents contribute materially to the Article III\npouers of the court—that is, to the rendering of verdicts and orders\naffecting “substantive legal rights.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. v. Onondaga,\n435 F.3d llo, l2l (2d Cir. 2oo6). Once the right ataches, it is overcome\nonly by a shouing that there are “countervailing factors” that outweigh the\npublic’s right to monitor judicial proceedings.\nDefendant’s Motion for New Trial. There is no question that Defendant’s\nmotion, which will directly inform the Court’s assessment of whether a\nnew trial is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>, is a “judicial document.” See Bernstein v. Bernstein\nLitouitz Berger & Grossman LLP, 8l4 F.3d l32, l4o, l42 (2d Cir. 2ol6).\nBecause the motion will be used to determine the parties’ “substantive\nlegal rights,” the presumptive right of access it at its highest. Jd.\nWe do not see anything on the public record indicating that Defendant has\nmet—or tried to meet—the high shouing required to justify a blanket\nsealing of its motion. It is simply not plausible that every word of a legal\nfiling such as this one requires total secrecy. To the extent that the motion\ncontains any sensitive information, there is a reasonable alternative to\nwholesale sealing: limited redactions of personally identifiable or sensitive\ninformation, if justified under the Lugosch standard. See Amodeo I, 44\nF.3d at l47.\n\n2\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8834\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008835.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document583_ Filed ol/25/22 Page3of5\nThe right to public access promises “immediate” and “contemporaneous”\naccess. Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l26. The Second Circuit has firmly held that\naccess does not—and should not—hinge on whether a judge has ruled on\nthe underlying motion. /d. at l26—27. Instead, delay is “effectively a\ndenial” and undermines the benefits of public scrutiny. /d. at l26. In\nLugosch, the Second Circuit rejected a request to delay access to pending\nsummary judgment papers. So, too, here Defendant’s request for a delay\nshould be denied.\n\nJuror Questionnaires. The juror questionnaires are judicial documents\nbecause they are relevant and useful to the performance of a judicial\nfunction: selecting a jury, a <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> component of a criminal trial. Here,\nthe presumptive right to access to these questionnaires is at its apex. In\neffect, the sealing of the questionnaires is the equivalent of barring the\npublic from the oral voir dire. Defendant’s motion requests a new trial\nbecause of alleged juror misconduct—and specifically, that “a juror failed\nto answer honestly a material question on voir dire.” Dkt. 57o. Juror 5o’s\nquestionnaires will thus, as Defendant recognizes, id., necessarily and\ndirectly affect the Court’s decision on whether the existing finding of guilt\nshould be vacated and whether a new trial is appropriate—fundamental\nArticle III determinations. See Amodeo I, 44 F.3d at l45. The\nquestionnaires for the remaining seated jurors are integral to determining\nwhether this is a lone or recurring incident.\nAny original need for sealing the questionnaires for the seated jurors—for\ninstance, that they might be subject to atempts to influence their\ndeliberations—has nou passed.

First, the\nDefendant’s motion to temporarily seal in their entirety all documents related to the motion for a\nnew trial is DENIED. Any sealing of judicial documents must be narrouly tailored to serve\ncompeting interests. In this case, important interests include preserving the integrity of any\ninquiry process going forward as well as protecting juror anonymity and privacy. Protection of\nthese interests, houever, can plainly be accomplished through tailored redactions.

Juror 5o’s motion to intervene, houever, will be\ndocketed because the Court DENIES the Defendant’s request to seal the motion. Even though\nthe motion to intervene is denied, it is a judicial document to which the presumption in favor of\npublic access applies and no interests are served by maintaining it under seal.\n\nl. Temporary sealing of documents related to the motion for a new trial\n\nThe Court first addresses the Defendant’s request that this Court seal all documents\nrelated to the motion for a new trial either until the motion is resolved or until after a hearing is\nconducted, should one be ordered. Dkt. No. 59o at l-2. The Court considers a request to seal\npursuant to the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). First, the Court determines whether the document in\nquestion is a “judicial document”—that is, a document “relevant to the performance of the\njudicial function and useful in the judicial process.” Jd. at ll9. If so, a presumption of access\nunder the First Amendment and common law ataches. In the second step of the inquiry, the\nCourt determines the weight to be accorded the presumption of access. /d. Finally, “after\ndetermining the weight of the presumption of access, the Court must ‘balance competing\nconsiderations against it,’” such as “the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial\nefficiency” and “the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.” /d. at l2o (quoting United\nStates v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o-5l (2d Cir. l995)).\n\nBoth parties agree that the motion papers are “judicial document[s] that [are] subject to a\nstrong presumption of access under both the First Amendment and common law.” Dkt. No. 594\nat 2 (quoting Dkt. No. 59o at 4). Houever, the Defendant argues that sealing pending a hearing\nor resolution is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> “to ensure the integrity of any fact-gathering process that may take\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo89lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008912.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document596 Filed o2/ll/22 Page4of7\n\nAccordingly, the Defendant’s motion to keep the papers under seal in their entirety is\ndenied. Instead, the parties must propose narrouly tailored redactions as <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to serve\nimportant interests. Here those interests are to ensure the integrity of any inquiry going forward\nand to protect juror anonymity and privacy. Those interests justify redaction of the questions the\nparties propose be asked at any hearing. See United States v. McCoy et al., No. l4 Cr. 6l8l\n(EAW), Dkt. No. 3l2 (text order) (W.D.N.Y. May 26, 2ol7) (requiring proposed questions to be\nsubmited directly to the court); see also Dkt. No. 329 at 38-39 (counsel discussing concern that\ndisclosing specific questions ahead of hearing would allou juror to prepare and “rehearse the\nanswers”). And they may justify redaction of any specific factual information developed by the\nparties that has not been publicly reported in the press and that the parties propose be inquired\nabout at any forthcoming hearing. The Court will also permit redactions <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to ensure\njuror anonymity and privacy. See Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of Cal., Riverside Cnty., 464\nU.S. 5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984). By contrast, there is no basis to redact legal arguments, case citations,\nand analysis regarding the standard by which the parties contend that the Defendant’s motion\nshould be evaluated, as well as legal arguments, case citations, and analysis regarding the proper\nscope of any potential hearing. Nor will the Court permit the redaction of information that is\nwidely reported in the press. Such redactions do not conform with the dictates of Lugosch and\nare not <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to protect the integrity of any inquiry.\n\nImportantly, follouing the Court’s resolution of the Defendant’s motion or a hearing, if\none is ordered, all redactions will be promptly unsealed except those <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to protect any\ncontinuing interest in juror anonymity and privacy.\n\nThe parties are thus ORDERED to propose narrouly tailored redactions to the Defense\nmotion, the Government’s response in opposition, and the Defense reply, as consistent with this\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo89l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008930.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6oo Filed o2/ll/22 Page6of37\n\nGhislaine Maxwell respectfully submits this Omnibus Memorandum in Support of her\nPost-Trial Motions. For the reasons set forth belou, Ms. Maxwell moves the Court, in the\nalternative, to:\n\nl. Vacate her convictions as to the Mann Act counts (Counts One through Four)\n\nand grant a new trial under Rule 33 because the convictions were based on a\nconstructive amendment/variance from the allegations in the S2 Indictment\n(the “Indictment’”).\n\n2.

The Court Must Vacate Ms. Maxwell’s Convictions on the Mann Act Counts Due to\n\na Constructive Amendment/Variance from the Crimes Charged in the Indictment.\n\nThroughout this case, the government has consistently maintained that to convict Ms.\nMaxwell on the Mann Act Counts (Counts One through Four), it was <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to prove that Ms.\nMaxwell enticed or caused underaged girls to travel to New York, or conspired to do the same,\nwith the intent that they would engage in illegal sexual activity that violated New York law. The\ngovernment further acknouledged that evidence of sexual activity that occurred in locations\noutside of New York, like Epstein’s residences in New Mexico and Florida, was not, by itself,\nsufficient to convict Ms. Maxwell on the Mann Act charges.\n\nNevertheless, the government repeatedly resisted numerous efforts by the defense to\nclarify these points for the jury, both in limiting instructions or in the jury charge itself. The\ngovernment stressed over and over that the jury could not possibly be confused that the Mann\nAct counts had to involve a violation of New York law because the jury instructions charged\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo893o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008933.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo _ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 9of37\n\nMS. MOE: That’s correct, your Honor.\n\nTHE COURT: So [Ms. Maxwell] couldn’t be convicted with respect to that count\n\n[based solely on Kate’s testimony].\n\nMS. MOE: That’s correct, your Honor.\n\nll/l/2o2l Tr. 67:l5-68:l9. Asa result, the Court agreed, over the objection of the government,\nto give the jury a limiting instruction before the start of Kate’s testimony which stated, among\nother things, that “any sexual conduct she says occurred with Mr. Epstein was not ‘illegal sexual\nactivity’ as the government has charged in the indictment.” Tr. ll67:23-ll68:2. The Court also\ngave a similar limiting instruction before Annie Farmer’s testimony because she testified about\nsexual contact in New Mexico, which could not have violated New York law. Tr. 2o48:22-\n2o49:l.\n\nSimilarly, when the parties submited their proposed joint requests to charge, the defense\nrequested that the instructions for the substantive Mann Act counts specify that the government\nmust prove that Jane traveled “from Florida to New York, as charged in the Indictment,” as\nopposed to simply that Jane traveled “in interstate commerce.” Dkt. 4lo-l at l9. The defense\nhighlighted that the addition was <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> because it was expected that Jane would testify\n“about traveling to, among other places, Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico” and “the elements\nshould make clear that the relevant travel for purposes of Count Two is travel from Florida to\nNew York, as alleged in the S2 Indictment.” /d. The government objected to the addition,\nstating it was unnecessary because travel to New York was already in the “to wit” clause of the\nIndictment and that “there [was] no need to include words like ‘travel from Florida to New York’\n... to avoid any suggestion of a variance.” Tr. 2759:l2-276o:9. The Court agreed with the\ngovernment. The final jury charge did not specifically mention travel “to New York” and\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8933\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008936.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page l2 of 37\n\nThe defense folloued up with a leter requesting that the Court give the jury the\nfollouing additional instruction to avoid a conviction on the substantive Mann Act counts based\non a constructive amendment or a prejudicial variance:\n\nAs to the third element of Count Two, you must determine whether the\n\nGovernment has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant acted with\n\nthe intent that Jane would engage in sexual activity within the state of New York\n\nin violation of New York Penal Law l3o.55.\n\nAs to the second element of Count Four, you must determine whether the\n\nGovernment has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant transported\n\nJane with the intent that Jane would engage in sexual activity within the state of\n\nNew York in violation of New York Penal Law l3o.55.\n\nAn intent that Jane engage in sexual activity in any state other than New York\n\ncannot form the basis of these two elements of Counts Two and Four.\n(Dkt. 566). The defense further argued that it would be insufficient and improper for the jury to\nconvict Ms. Maxwell based solely on New Mexico conduct and that the instruction was\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to prevent that outcome. Tr. 3l52:ll-3l54:lo. The Court declined to give the\nsupplemental instruction. The jury ultimately convicted Ms. Maxwell on Count Four and the\ntwo Mann Act conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three.\n\nB. Applicable Law\n\n“To prevail on a constructive amendment claim, a defendant must demonstrate that the\nterms of [an] indictment are in effect altered by the presentation of evidence and jury instructions\nwhich so modify essential elements of the offense charged that there is a substantial likelihood\nthat the defendant may have been convicted of an offense other than that charged in the\nindictment.” United States v. Gross, No. l5-cr-769 (AJN), 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2o (S.D.N.Y.\nOct. l8, 2ol7) (cleaned up). “Because the doctrine of constructive amendment protects a\ndefendant’s Grand Jury Clause rights, a constructive amendment constitutes a ‘per se violation’\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights—i.e. there is no requirement that a defendant make a\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8936\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008944.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 2o of 37\nNew Mexico trip to see if it supported a conviction under Count Four, which led to the question\nposed by the Jury Note.\n\nThis is also consistent with the jury’s decision to acquit Ms. Maxwell on the substantive\nenticement offense (Count Two). The jury likely determined that the only corroborating\nevidence linking Ms. Maxwell to the New Mexico trip was a flight log shouing that she was\npresent on the trip but said nothing about whether she “persuaded, induced, enticed, or coerced”\nJane to take the trip. Indeed, Jane did not testify about having any interaction with Ms. Maxwell\nprior to the flight to New Mexico in which they discussed the trip. Hence, the acquital on Count\nTwo. By contrast, the jury likely believed that if they found that Ms. Maxwell had some role in\narranging Jane’s return flight from New Mexico, after the sexual abuse had already taken place,\nthey could convict her on the substantive transportation count (Count Four), assuming that\narranging the return flight was sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count Four. Hence, the\nquestion in the Jury Note.\n\nRegardless, it is clear from the Jury Note that the jurors were deliberating with a mistaken\nunderstanding of the law — namely, that it would be sufficient to satisfy the second element of\nCount Four if they found that Ms. Maxwell had intended Jane to engage in sexual activity in\nNew Mexico, without finding any intent to violate New York law. The Court’s response to refer\nthe jurors to the existing instructions was insufficient because the jury charge, which had been\nstripped of any mention of “travel to New York,” did not adequately instruct the jury that a\nconviction on Count Four could not be based solely on sexual abuse in New Mexico or any other\njurisdiction outside of New York. It was <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for the Court to give the jury a supplemental\ninstruction, as requested by the defense, to clarify the correct basis for conviction under Count\nFour.

Accordingly, it is not <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to redact\ndiscussions of Juror 5o’s questionnaire from the briefing.\n\ne The defendant seeks to redact legal arguments about the statistical composition of the jury\npool.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nJuror 5o respectfully moves this Court and requests an Order granting him the right to\nintervene in this action, under the Court’s inherent authority, in order to protect his compelling\nprivacy interests and potential criminal liability, both of which are implicated by this Court’s\nprior order that his conduct during his service as a member of the jury be potentially subject to an\ninvestigation to determine the existence of possible juror misconduct.\n\nJuror 5o seeks to intervene at this time in order to protect his privacy rights and his right\nto avoid self-incrimination, and to further ensure that he will not be prejudiced by any\ninvestigation ordered by this Court, should any subsequent action be brought against him as a\nresult of such investigation. First and foremost, obtaining access to the questionnaire Juror 5o\ncompleted as part of the selection process for jury service (hereafter the “Jury Questionnaire’’)\nand the transcript of his testimony during voir dire are critical to Juror 5o’s ability to determine if\nhe “wishes to be heard on the issue of the appropriateness of an inquiry” by filing a brief. Order\nat l. Jan. 5, 2o22. 2o-CR-33o. In order to achieve appropriate access to such documents and\nrecords, Juror 5o must be granted leave to Intervene in this action, and thereby given a fair\nopportunity to brief this Court as to why he should be heard, if indeed he determines that to be\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>.\n\nIt is respectfully submited that, in order to ensure the integrity of the process, the Jury\nQuestionnaire and the transcript of Juror 5o’s voir dire should be released, under seal, to Juror\n5o’s atorney, the Prosecution and Defense Counsel.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8983\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008985.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6o9 Filed o2/24/22 Page6ofl3\nwhen questioned about his answers to the Jury Questionnaire; therefore Juror 5o has a\ncompelling need to be able to separately confirm his recollection—regardless of whether or not\nthere may exist a lapse in such recollection—and to be fully prepared to explain himself, as may\nbe <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>, pursuant to an inquiry directed by the order of this Court. Juror 5o further desires\nto maintain his privacy and, to the extent possible, avoid having to disclose intimate details of his\nexperience as the victim of prior sexual assault.\nTW. ARGUMENT\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the Court should, in its proper exercise of discretion,\nallou Juror 5o to intervene in this action and grant release, under seal, of a copy of his Jury\nQuestionnaire to his atorney, the Prosecution and Defense Counsel.\n\nThe relevant precedent from case law makes it abundantly clear that jurors have\ncompelling and legitimate rights to privacy regarding “intensely personal subjects,” including\nprior sexual assaults. Juror 5o’s right to privacy is clearly implicated by an inquiry by and before\nthis Court, as the same relates directly and specifically claims concerning his experience(s) as a\nsurvivor of past sexual abuse and discussions he may have had with other jurors, in which he is\nalleged to have detailed his history as a victim of prior sexual assault. These factors are\nheightened by the intense media scrutiny surrounding the instant case and the already significant\npress coverage of Juror 5o himself, including the statements that he has made to the media about\nhis jury service.\n\nJudge Nathan specifically invited Juror 5o to address the “appropriateness of an inquiry”\ninto his conduct as a juror and affect that his personal history may have had on juror\ndeliberations and the verdict rendered in this mater. Order at l. Jan. 5, 2o22. 2o-CR-\n33o.Therefore, by allouing Juror 5o to intervene in this action, this Court can ensure that Juror\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8985\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008988.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6o9 Filed o2/24/22 Page9ofl3\nintervention in criminal cases by third parties who are seeking to prevent the wide dissemination\nof confidential or privileged information.

Juror 5o’s Jury Questionnaire should be released to Counsel, but\notherwise remain under seal, to provide Juror 5o with a full and fair\nopportunity to present his position to this Court\nl. A copy of the Jury Questionnaire is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to comply with\nJudge Nathan’s January 5\" order\nIt is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for Juror 5o to review his answers to the Jury Questionnaire and the\ntranscript of his voir dire testimony, before he is able to comply with Judge Nathan’s order and\naddress the “appropriateness of an inquiry”, into his conduct and his truthfulness of his responses\non the Jury Questionnaire. See Order at l. Jan. 5, 2o22. 2o-CR-33o. It should go without saying\nthat Juror 5o needs to knou whether or not the question(s) related to prior sexual abuse were\nanswered by him correctly on his Jury Questionnaire to help determine what an appropriate\ninquiry would entail, so that the same would also Juror 5o’s privacy rights and legitimate\ninterests related to these maters.\n9\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8988\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008994.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6lo_ Filed o2/24/22 Page2of3\nAccordingly, for the reasons fully explained in the Opinion & Order, a hearing is\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to resolve the Defendant’s motion. Because of the important interest in the finality of\njudgments, the standard for obtaining a post-verdict hearing is high. The Court concludes, and\n\nthe Government concedes, that the demanding standard for holding a post-verdict evidentiary\nhearing is met as to whether Juror 5o failed to respond truthfully during the jury selection\nprocess to whether he was a victim of sexual abuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several\ndirect, unambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his oun experience that do not\npertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses during jury\nselection. Juror 5o’s post-trial statements are “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible\nevidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety”—namely, a false statement during jury\nselection—has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear,\nthe potential impropriety is not that someone with a history of sexual abuse may have served on\nthe jury. Rather, it is the potential failure to respond truthfully to questions during the jury\nselection process that asked for that material information so that any potential bias could be\nexplored.\n\nIn contrast, the demanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to\nthe conduct of any other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect\nto the other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant’s request for a broader hearing and\npre-hearing discovery.\n\nThe Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at which the Court will question\nJuror 5o under oath. The Court further ORDERS that Juror 5o’s questionnaire be unsealed, for\nthe reasons explained in the Opinion & Order. The Court will email counsel for Juror 5o a copy\nof his questionnaire and a copy of this Order. As also explained in the Opinion & Order, the\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8994\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009014.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 Filed o2/24/22 Page l3 of 66\n\ne Question 47, “No,” Juror No. 5o would not have any difficulty assessing\nthe credibility of alleged victims of sexual assault or abuse just as he would\nassess the credibility of any other witness.\n\ne Finally, and most importantly, Juror No. 5o answered “no” when asked in\nQuestion 48 if he had ever been the victim of victim of sexual harassment,\nsexual abuse, or sexual assault, including actual or atempted sexual assault\nor other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, acquaintance,\nsupervisor, teacher, or family member.\n\nC.

Without conferring as to either the submission of the\nleter or any redactions, the government publicly filed Docket No. 568. This leter\ncommunicated to Juror No. 5o, and the media, that Juror No. 5o had done something\nwrong, that his conduct would be subject to scrutiny, and that the conduct was serious\nenough to warrant appointment of a lawyer, free of charge if <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>.\n\nHad Ms. Maxwell been asked, she would have objected to the public filing of this\nleter, which caused Juror No. 5o to delete his social media accounts and alerted Juror\nNo. 5o that he needed to stop giving media presentations and to work on his story.\n\nThe government knous hou to file a leter under seal, and this Court’s protocol\nthroughout this case has been for the parties to file leters or pleadings under restriction\nwith a conferral and briefing as to what portion of the document should be redacted.

Ianniello, 866 F.2d 54o, 543\n(2d Cir. l989). While the Government consents to a hearing, its scope “should be limited to only\nwhat is absolutely <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to determine the facts with precision.” Jd. at 544. Such a hearing\nshould be limited to questioning of Juror 5o by the Court, in order to determine: (l) whether he\ndeliberately lied in response to Question 48, regarding being a victim of sexual abuse, and, if so,\n(2) whether the Court would have struck Juror 5o for cause if he had accurately responded to that\nquestion, i.e., based on a finding that he could not be fair and impartial.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nl. The Jury Selection Process\n\nBefore trial, the jury department for the Southern District of New York conducted five\nsessions over the course of November 4, 5, and l2, 2o2l during which 694 jurors completed a\njuror questionnaire approved by the Court. Nov. l5, 2o2l Tr. at 2:2o-2l. The juror questionnaire\nwas 29 pages and comprised of 5l questions, many of which contained subparts. The parties\nreviewed the completed questionnaires and then conferred, submiting a joint list delineating four\ncategories of prospective jurors: (l) prospective jurors that both the Government and defense\ncounsel agreed should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors that both the Government and\ndefense counsel agreed should be excused or struck for cause; (3) prospective jurors that defense\ncounsel, but not the Government, believed should be excused or struck for cause; and (4)\nprospective jurors that the Government, but not defense counsel, believed should be excused or\nstruck for cause. /d. at 2:22-3:4. In addition, the Court sent the parties a list of l3 prospective\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l23\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009151.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 32 of 49\nconduct which was similar to the charged offenses such that the juror may have felt that she was\n“confronting the legality of [her] oun past acts as well.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 48. While the Second\nCircuit held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in inferring bias under the\ncircumstances presented there, it also made clear that the district would not have erred in declining\nto infer bias. Jd. Torres thus underscores the ample discretion which district judges have in\nstriking jurors for cause—discretion which this Court has properly exercised not to infer bias\nwhere jurors have disclosed being victims of sexual abuse or harassment.\n\nThe defendant has failed to establish inferred bias.\n\nI. The Court Should Schedule a Limited Hearing Regarding Juror 5o\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nA post-verdict hearing into alleged juror misconduct is proper only where there is “clear,\nstrong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence . . . that a specific, non-speculative impropriety\nhas occurred.” United States v. Stewart, 59o F.3d 93, l33 (2d Cir. 2oo9) (quoting /anniello, 866\nF.2d at 543). This standard can only be met by “concrete allegations of inappropriate conduct that\nconstitute competent and relevant evidence,” though such allegations “need not be irrebutable\nbecause if the allegations were conclusive, there would be no need for a hearing.” United States\nv. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8) (quoting Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543).\n\nIn the rare instances where an inquiry into potential juror misconduct is warranted, the\nscope of the hearing must be narrouly tailored. The Second Circuit has emphasized that the\ninquiry “should be limited to only what is absolutely <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to determine the facts with\nprecision.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544. “A hearing is not held to afford a convicted defendant the\nopportunity to ‘conduct a fishing expedition.’” United States v. Sun Myung Moon, 7l8 F.2d l2lo,\nl234 (2d Cir. l983) (quoting United States v. Moten, 582 F.2d 654, 667 (2d Cir. l978)). Instead,\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l5l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009154.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 35 of 49\ninterviewed by the Court; the parties were permited to propose questions before and during the\nhearing.”), aff'd, 285 F.3d l58 (2d Cir. 2oo2).\n\nThat course of action is especially appropriate here for several reasons. First, the subject\nmater—the juror’s history of sexual abuse—presents a particularly high danger of harassment or\nembarrassment. Second, as noted above, the defendant’s brief is litered with information barred\nby Rule 6o6(b), suggesting a real danger she will seek to question Juror 5o about improper and\ninadmissible subjects. The Court should exercise its discretion to supervise the hearing by\nconducting the questioning itself.\n\n2. The Scope of the Hearing Should Be Limited\n\nThe scope of the hearing should be tightly limited to “only what is absolutely <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to\ndetermine the facts with precision.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544; see also Sun Myung Moon, 7l8\nF.2d at l234; Gagnon, 282 F. App’x at 4o.4 Here, the only issues relevant under McDonough are\nwhether Juror 5o intentionally lied in response to Question 48, and whether Juror 5o was actually\nbiased against the defendant. No other subjects are appropriate for inquiry.!°\nl4 Tn particular, Juror 5o cannot be asked to testify about what was said by any juror (including\nhim) in the jury room, or what his mental process was as a deliberating juror. He also cannot be\nasked whether he or any other juror discussed personal experiences with sexual abuse during\ndeliberations. Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b); Warger, 574 U.S. at 43-44 (“We hold that Rule 6o6(b) applies\nto juror testimony during a proceeding in which a party seeks to secure a new trial on the ground\nthat a juror lied during voir dire.”).\n\nl5 For the reasons discussed above,\n\nSimilarly, as discussed above, the defendant has also not met her\nburden with respect to whether Juror 5o answered Question 25 incorrectly, namely, whether Juror\n5o considers himself to be a victim of a crime. Houever, in the event that Juror 5o’s testimony at\nthe hearing regarding Question 48 makes clear that Juror 5o answered Question 25 incorrectly as\nwell, the Government would consent to the Court questioning Juror 5o regarding that question.\nHouever, that questioning should be limited in the same manner as discussed throughout with\nrespect to Question 48.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l54\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009155.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 36 of 49\n\nThis inquiry should be tightly focused. LC\nee\na ee\nere\neee\nee\n\nOn this last subject, the defendant claims that had Juror 5o answered Question 48 in the\naffirmative, the Court and the parties would have “probed” him about various topics, which the\ndefendant suggests are <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> topics of examination. (Def. Mem. at 44). The record refutes\nthat assertion, and inquiry along the lines proposed by the defendant is not <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>.\n\nThe defendant argues that the Court would have inquired whether Juror 5o was able to\nassess the credibility of a witness claiming sexual assault or abuse just like he would any other\nwitness. (/d.). As an initial mater, Juror 5o already stated in the juror questionnaire that he could\nassess the credibility of a witness claiming sexual assault or abuse just like he would any other\nwitness. (Def. Ex. l, Question 47). Moreover, the Court did not ask jurors who answered Question\n48 in the affirmative any follou up questions about Question 47. Accordingly, there is no need to\ninquire about this subject any further at a hearing, beyond perhaps reaffirming that Juror 5o’s\nanswer to Question 47 was correct.\n\n‘6 The Court need not inquire about the details of the victim’s sexual abuse, just as the Court did\nnot probe such details with respect to other jurors who answered Question 48 affirmatively. (See\nNov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l8-l9, 52-57, 2oo, 2o7-o8, 259, 293, 532, 635). In the event the Court\nbelieves that details need to be elicited, beyond those few details Juror 5o has provided publicly,\nsuch inquiry should be conducted at sidebar or in camera. See Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544; Shakur,\n723 F. Supp. at 928.\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l55\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009158.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 39 of 49\nMem. at 44). Instead, the questioning of Juror 5o should be limited to only what is strictly\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to determine the relevant issues.\n\n3. There Is No Basis to Call Any Other Juror as a Witness\n\nThere is no basis to call any other witness at a hearing aside from Juror 5o. The questioning\nof Juror 5o is sufficient to address the only questions as to which the rigorous standard for an\nevidentiary hearing has been met.\n\nThe defendant nevertheless proposes calling each of the twelve jurors for testimony about\nwhether they have experienced sexual abuse. (Def. Mem. at 5o, 57). It would be difficult to\nimagine a spectacle more damaging to the jury process than requiring each of the jurors to return\nto court weeks or months after their service was complete to testify about such a deeply personal\nand sensitive subject. The defendant’s request is exactly the sort of “fishing expedition” that\npresents the “evil consequences” of which the Second Circuit has repeatedly warned. See\nTanniello, 866 F.2d at 543; Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234.\n\nThe defendant’s request for such an inquisition is based on a single sentence in a newspaper\narticle, which reports that an anonymous “second juror described in an interview with The New\nYork Times having been sexually abused as a child.” See\nhtps://www.nytimes.com/2o22/ol/o5/nyregion/maxwell-trial-jury-inquiry.html.'7 It is\nquestionable that this report itself may be considered under Rule 6o6(b), insofar as the next\nsentence refers to the juror’s experience in the context of jury deliberations, so it is not clear from\nthe article whether the anonymous juror made any statements to the reporter that were separate\nThe defendant’s motion also states that Juror 5o has made public statements about another juror\nwho discussed experiences with sexual abuse in the context of deliberations. Rule 6o6(b)\nprecludes the Court from considering this. See Warger, 574 U.S. at 43 (affirming denial of motion\nfor a new trial under McDonough, where the only evidence of juror dishonesty was an affidavit\nfrom another juror regarding statements a juror had made during deliberations).\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l58\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009159.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 4o of 49\n\nfrom his or her discussion of deliberations. But even if it were properly considered, this one-\nsentence, hearsay report of an anonymous speaker is not a sufficient basis for dragging the entire\njury in for questioning at a hearing in an effort to root out the identity of this particular juror. As\nnoted, a hearing is warranted only where there is “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible\nevidence that a specific, non-speculative impropriety has occurred.” Stewart, 59o F.3d at l33-34\n(quotation omited). “Gossip and anonymous tips do not satisfy this standard.” United States v.\nStewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d 432, 443 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo4), aff'd, 433 F.3d 273, 3o6 (2d Cir. 2oo6). The\nSecond Circuit and courts in this district have thus repeatedly found that a hearing is not <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>\non similar facts.\n\nFor example, in United States v. Guzman Loera, a magazine article published shortly after\nthe verdict stated that an unnamed juror alleged that jurors folloued media coverage of the trial in\nviolation of the court’s instructions, and that they heard prejudicial information not admited\nduring the trial, including that the defendant had drugged and raped underaged girls. No. l9-2239,\n2o22 WL 2ll99, at *l2 (2d Cir. Jan. 25, 2o22). During trial, the district court had repeatedly\ninstructed the jury to avoid media coverage and on two occasions had canvassed the jury and spoke\nwith jurors individually about particular articles. /d. One juror acknouledged seeing the relevant\nheadline before turning away and another acknouledged seeing part of a headline before closing\nthe application. /d. & n.l5. The anonymous juror’s statements in the magazine article, houever,\nsuggested that the extent of juror exposure to this prejudicial media information was far more\nextensive, and that some jurors had discussed lying to the judge when he inquired about their\nexposure to that coverage. See Brief for Appellant, 2o2o WL 575793o, at *l57-*6l (2d Cir. Sept.\n4, 2o2o) (quoting article). Nevertheless, the district court concluded that the defendant had failed\nto meet his burden to establish that an evidentiary hearing was warranted, and the Second Circuit\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l59\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009162.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 43 of 49\n\nto become a “fishing expedition” but rather must limit the scope of any inquiry “to only what is\nabsolutely <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to determine the facts with precision.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543-44. It is\nhard to imagine a request more likely to “subject[] juries to harassment” and “inhibit juryroom\ndeliberation,” id. at 543, than the defendant’s request to compel production of a juror’s emails and\nother writen communications, as well as content from his Facebook, Twiter, LinkedIn, Instagram,\nand other social media accounts. (Def. Mem. at 48-49). Not surprisingly, the defendant cites no\nprecedent for this sweeping and invasive request. The Court should reject it.\n\nMoreover, each specific request is improper. Requests l(b) and l(c) call for\ncommunications between jurors and communications “about Juror No. 5o’s jury service,” and thus\ncall for information that, if it exists, is almost certainly inadmissible under Rule 6o6(b). Moreover,\nthe fact that Juror 5o made some public statements about his jury service does not give the\ndefendant license to compel the production of any statements he may have made to anyone—such\nas a friend or loved one—about his jury service. This is a classic fishing expedition and should\nnot be permited. Request l(a) calls for communications with victims and witnesses, but this too\nis a fishing expedition: Juror 5o’s public comment on a victim’s public Twiter post after trial does\nnot give the defense license to compel his private communications in the vague hope that, contrary\nto the Court’s instructions, he had some improper communications before or during trial. And\nRequest l(d) calls for communications about any payment Juror 5o received for media interviews,\nbut even if he received compensation for post-trial interviews that says nothing whatsoever about\nwhether the Court would have struck him for cause before trial based on his alleged experience\nwith sexual abuse.\n\nRequests 2(a) and 2(b) ask the Court to direct numerous social media companies to produce\nall communications to and from Juror 5o about his jury service and all posts or comments regarding\n4]\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l62\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009183.jpg": "l/26/22, 3:3oPM Case l:2o-cr-Oo@MakihtexwellD @ceays evitefich Deminced kad she WAd A2predatdr ADpay Ma fOntihe\nSEMENT Maxwell faced six counts relating to sex trafficking signed an earlier £37o,ooo ($5oo,ooo) legal setlement\nwhich centered on the stories of four victims. with pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, the duke's friend.\nA fifth victim, Kate, was called only to shou a patern of Pale Raberts, a6, ene af the bllkernsatn Sex alfensier .\ning behavi d di ly imoli dj most high-profile victims, claims she was trafficked by\nOreeming Denaviet ana WEE-NS!

As the childhood victim of a sex crime, answering questions in a case about a childhood\nsex crime, there is no plausible explanation for why Juror No. 5o did not answer Question 25,\n“Yes.” The only believable answer is that he knew that answering that question “Yes” would\nlead to further questions like, what was the crime, which would then lead to questions about what\nhappened to him, which would end with his disqualification.\n\n® Greer, 285 F.3d at l73.\n\n7 A deliberately false answer by a juror in voir dire is thus neither <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> nor sufficient\nto entitle a defendant to a new trial. It’s not <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> because, if a biased juror actually serves\non a jury, structural error occurs, and a new trial is required even if the juror did not provide a\ndeliberately false answer during voir dire. Martinez-Salazar, 528 U.S. at 3l6; McDonough, 464\nUS. at 556-57 (Blackmun, J., concurring); id. at 557-58 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment);\nSmith, 455 U.S. at 2l5-l6; id. at 22o-24 (O’Connor, J., concurring); Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3;\nGreer, 285 F.3d t l7l-72; Langford, 99o F.2d at 68. And it’s not sufficient because a juror may\nnot be biased even if he dishonestly answers a question during voir dire. Greer, 285 F.3d at l73\n(“[A]n analysis of bias is required even if the juror’s erroneous response was deliberate.”).\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo92o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009219.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Page 29 of 32\nability to establish that yet a second juror was biased by having been a victim of the very type of\ncrime at issue in this trial. The cases relied on by the government are inapposite as none reach\nthe issue of whether a juror was dishonest in response to voir dire questions regarding whether\nthey had been the victim of the same type of crime at issue. See Resp. at 38-39. Importantly, the\ngovernment cites only to cases where the only evidence that a juror had engaged in misconduct\nwas a news article to that effect. Here, there are two pieces of evidence: one, the New York\nTimes article, and two, Juror No. 5o’s media statement that a second juror disclosed that they\nwere also a victim of childhood sexual abuse. Where there is \"clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence\" of juror misconduct, a hearing on that issue is required. United States\nv. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o2-o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6).\n\nThe government paints a parade of horrors to try to dissuade the Court from pursuing this\nsecond clear instance of a juror’s inaccurate voir dire statement on a critical issue in this case.\nResp. at 37. Yet simply asking the other ll jurors one question, whether they were the victim of\nchildhood sexual abuse is not the intrusion the government suggests; the juror apparently felt\ncomfortable sharing that information both during deliberations and also to the New York Times.\n\n4. Ms. Maxwell is entitled to Discovery\n\nThe government cites no authority for its request to foreclose discovery in advance of the\nhearing, nor could they given that such discovery is often <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to establish the very\nmisconduct at issue. The government’s complaints center on their view that the requested\ndiscovery is either overbroad or violative of Rule 6o6(b). The government intentionally mis-\nreads the defendant’s request. Obviously, Ms. Maxwell would be requesting communications\nthat occurred outside of deliberations. It is also surprising that the government thinks that there\nwill be a \"high volume\" of social media material during the \"relevant time frame,\" l.e., between\nwhen Juror No. 5o ls\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo92l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009238.jpg": "Case 2o5l-oo88o; PAEumBmctien en O34 Fileddz/24/22agePagee 36 of 67\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, vy\n\nPAUL M.

Conrad was admited to the practice of law in the State of New York by the Se-\ncond Judicial Department on January 26, 2ooo, and, at all times relevant to this proceeding, has maintained an office\nfor the practice of law within the First Judicial Department.\n\nIn a previous order dated December l8, 2oo7, this Court suspended respondent from the practice of law for fail-\nure to respond to requests made by the Departmental Disciplinary Commitee pursuant to its investigation of two\ncomplaints made against her (22 NYCRR 6o3.4[e][l][i] ). After receiving a response by respondent six months later\nseeking an opportunity to respond to the complaints, the Commitee conducted an investigation. Based upon re-\nspondent's admited problem with alcohol dependency, which she acknouledged was connected to her failure to\ncooperate and the underlying conduct, the Commitee obtained a psychiatric evaluation of respondent in November\n2oo9, and a subsequent re-evaluation in May 2olo. The psychiatrist determined that respondent's prognosis is good,\nbut did not go as far as to assert that she is nou fit to re-commence the practice of law.\n\nThe Departmental Disciplinary Commitee nou moves for an order suspending respondent from the practice of\nlaw on the ground that she suffers from a “disability by reason of physical or mental infirmity or illness” (22 NY-\nCRR 6o3.l6{c][l] ). In her cross motion respondent seeks to convert the current suspension to a medical suspension\nnunc pro tunc, but further seeks an order vacating the suspension and reinstating her to the practice of law, due to\nher year-long sobriety.\n\nThe Commitee's motion, and the first branch of respondent's cross motion, are granted to the extent that the\nprior finding of non-cooperation is vacated and an order **l89 of suspension based upon the atorney's medical dis-\nability is granted nunc pro tune (see Mater of Kaplan, 65 A.D.3d 287, 883 N.Y.S.2d l82 [2oo9]: Mater of Fusco,\nl8 A.D.3d 8l, 798 N.Y.S.2d 364 [2oo5] ).\n\n[l][2] Houever, that branch of respondent's cross motion seeking immediate reinstatement is denied at this\ntime. The cross motion itself concedes the existence of the alcohol dependence rendering her unfit to practice law;\nadditionally, she acknouledged during her deposition that her failure to cooperate and *l7o her underlying conduct\nwas related to alcoho! dependency. To support her cross motion, respondent implies that the examining psychiatrist\nfailed to satisfy an obligation to establish that she continues to be unfit to resume her practice, Houever, to be enti-\ntled to reinstatement, since the initial infirmity has been conceded, it is respondent who must prove her fitness to be\nreinstated (see 22 NYCRR 6o3.l6[f] ), and that burden is not satisfied here by her oun self-assessment (see Mater\nof Stewart, 47 A.D.3d 43, 846 N.Y.S.2d l3 [2oo7] ). The branch of respondent's cross motion seeking reinstatement\nto the practice of law therefore must be denied at this time, without prejudice to a further application, supported by\nan evaluation by a mental health provider atesting to her current fitness to re-commence the practice of law (see\nMater of Supino, 23 A.D.3d ll, l4, 8o6 N.Y.S.2d l78 [2oo5] ).\n\nAccordingly, the Commitee's motion and respondent's cross motion should be granted to the extent that the pri-\nor order's finding of non-cooperation is vacated, and respondent is suspended from the practice of law for an indefi-\n© 2ol] Thomson Reuters.

Each of these rules requires knouledge on the part of the lawyer, and that knouledge\nmust be “actual” knouledge. The standard is a subjective one. New York Rule l.o(k) contains\nthis definition:\n_ Knouingly, knoun, knou, or knous denotes actual knouledge of\nthe fact in question. A person’s knouledge may be inferred from circumstances. !\nlo. A leading Second Circuit case addresses the knouledge requirement. In Doe v. Federal\nGrievance Commitee, 847 F.2d 57 (2™ Cir. l988), a district judge in Connecticut disciplined a\nlawyer who did not report his belief that an opposing witness had lied in a deposition. The\nConnecticut (and the New York) rule at the time required a “lawyer who receives information\nclearly establishing that...[a] person other than his client has perpetrated a fraud upon a tribunal\n* | have also been asked to address the potential relevance of Rule 8.4(d) of the New York Rules, which\nsays that a “lawyer or law firm shall not...engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the\nadministration of justice.” This rule should not be read to expand Rule 3.3’s mens rea\nrequirement of knouledge. When the New York Rules of Professional Conduct were adopted to\nreplace the Code of Professional Responsibility, the courts chose the standard of “knouledge,”\nthe same standard as in the ABA Model Rules, to replace “clearly established,” which the Second\nCircuit had already interpreted to mean “knouledge” (see {l lo-ll infra). When a specific and\nconsidered rule requires knouledge, another and general rule should not be interpreted to\nimpose a duty based on a louer standard. There would be obvious notice and fairness interests\nimplicated in doing so. ;\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9449\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009506.jpg": "Case D2oen8oB38R PAgCUNBoc anentlEl6622 o lRildd) 82l24) 2P ag PayefsiS of ll7\nA-593o\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o4 _ Filed o3/l6/l3 Page l of l4\n4l85 AVENUE OFTHE AMERICAS 3lST FLOOR\n7 NEW YORK, NY loo36-26o3\ny.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nCounsel for Juror 5o has filed a motion to intervene, and to obtain a copy of certain\nmaterials relating to jury selection. The motion was submited by email to Chambers. In an Order\ndated January l2, 2o22, the Court directed the parties “to submit via email any proposed redactions\non or before January l3, 2o22, justifying any such request by reference to the three-part test\narticulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir.\n2oo6).” The Government respectfully submits that no redactions are <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>, and accordingly\nthe motion should be publicly filed.\n\nThe defendant opposes any public filing of Juror 5o’s motion, arguing that it is not a\njudicial document. This argument is meritless. Juror 5o’s motion to intervene is quite obviously\n“relevant to the performance of a judicial function and useful in the judicial process.” United States\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9537\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009543.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page 2of2l\norder to resolve the motion at this stage, the Court would have to accept these unsworn\nstatements made to media outlets as true and reach factual determinations that are not available\non the current record.\n\nAccordingly, a hearing is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to resolve the Defendant’s motion. The Court\nconcludes, and the Government concedes, that the demanding standard for holding an\nevidentiary hearing is met as to Juror 5o’s answer to Question 48 of the questionnaire. The\nCourt further concludes that Juror 5o’s response to Question 25 is relevant to the inquiry.\nFollouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct, unambiguous statements to multiple media outlets\nabout his oun experience that do not pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the\naccuracy of his responses to Questions 25 and 48. Such statements are “clear, strong, substantial\nand incontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety”—namely a false\nstatement during jury selection—has occurred. To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that\nsomeone with a history of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential\nfailure to respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that\nmaterial information so that any potential bias could be explored. Conversely, the demanding\nstandard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to Juror 5o’s use of social media nor\nthe conduct of any other juror. The Court therefore ORDERS a hearing take place at which the\nCourt will question Juror 5o under oath. The Defendant’s request for a broader hearing and pre-\nhearing discovery is DENIED.\n\nI. Background\n\nOn December 29, 2o2l, the jury returned a verdict in this case, finding the Defendant\nguilty of five counts. A week after the jury announced its verdict, on January 5, 2o22, the\nGovernment informed the Court that a juror had given at least three post-verdict interviews to\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9543\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009544.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o - Filed o2/25/22 Page3of2l\n\npress outlets about his jury service and requested a hearing be held on the mater. Dkt. No. 568.\nThe leter noted that in the interviews, which were both in print and on video, the juror\n“described being a victim of sexual abuse” and asserted that he “flew through” the juror\nquestionnaire and did not recall being asked whether he had been a victim of sexual abuse. /d. at\nl. The Government indicated in a redacted footnote that it believed the juror to be Juror 5o, and\na review of his questionnaire shoued that he had provided a negative response to a question that\nasked whether a prospective juror had been a victim of sexual abuse. Jd. at 2 n.2.! Finally, the\nGovernment requested that the Court offer court-appointed counsel to the juror in the event a\nhearing was ordered. A leter from the Defendant folloued shortly thereafter also informing the\nCourt about the juror’s interviews. Dkt. No. 569. The Defendant filed a second leter that same\nday opposing the Government’s request “because based on undisputed, publicly available\ninformation, the Court can and should order a new trial without any evidentiary hearing.” Dkt.\nNo. 57o.7\n\nThe Defendant filed a motion for a new trial on January l9, 2o22. The Government\nopposed the motion on February 2, 2o22, and the Defendant filed a reply in support on February\n9, 2o22. In addition to Juror 5o’s post-trial interviews, the Defendant’s motion relies on a New\nYork Times article reporting that “a second juror described in an interview . . . having been\n! The Government proposed redacting the footnote because the juror questionnaire was not a public document at that\ntime. Because (for the reasons explained belou) the Court nou unseals the questionnaire, that redaction is no longer\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>.\n? For completeness of the record, the Court notes the follouing occurred also on January 5, 2o22: The Jury\nDepartment of the Southern District of New York received a call from Juror 5o asking for guidance because of\nstatements he had given to certain media outlets that were being widely reported on in the press and inquiring\nwhether he needed an atorney. At the Court’s direction, the District Executive returned Juror 5o’s call and\ninformed him that the Court was unable to provide any guidance or response to his question. Juror 5o then asked the\nDistrict Executive if he could access his questionnaire. The District Executive, again at the Court’s direction,\ninformed Juror 5o that the questionnaire was not a public document and could not be provided to him.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9544\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009548.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 62o _ Filed o2/25/22 Page/7of2l\ndeliberations.” Maxwell Reply Br. at 8. This argument is wrong, as “the ultimate purpose of the\n[requested] post-trial evidentiary hearing is to set aside a jury verdict.” Ventura, 2ol4 WL\n259655, at *3.

The Court has discretion to structure the hearing and to determine what testimony\nis needed. Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544.\n\nB. The scope of the hearing\n\nThe Court will conduct an evidentiary hearing on whether Juror 5o provided false\nanswers on the questionnaire, the explanation for those answers, and hou Juror 5o would have\nresponded to follou-up questions if accurate answers had been provided. The Government\nacknouledges that Juror 5o’s answer to Question 48 satisfies the demanding standard for an\nevidentiary hearing under McDonough. Gov. Br. at 33. The Court agrees. Question 48 asked\njurors:\n\nHave you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual\n\nharassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault?

The Defendant can only speculate that the requested communications\nbetween Juror 5o and unknoun persons and entities would shed any light on Juror 5o’s answers\nto the questionnaire and his bias before the trial at the time of voir dire. Nor has the Defendant\nexplained why Juror 5o’s receipt of financial payment for interviews after the trial, if true, would\nbe probative of his inclination to not disclose at voir dire prior to trial. The Court will not grant\nthe Defendant “the opportunity to ‘conduct a fishing expedition.’” Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234\n(quoting Moten, 582 F.2d at 667).\n\nMoreover, the Defendant’s requested subpoenas directed at social media companies who\nhave custody of Juror 5o’s communications, comments, and posts are procedurally improper.\nThose requests for social media content are subject to the Stored Communications Act, l8 U.S.C.\n§§ 27ol-ll, which requires an additional factual shouing for the Court to order disclosure, see 2\nWayne LaFave et al., Criminal Procedure §§ 4.8(b), 4.8(d) (4th ed. 2o2l); Mater of Warrant to\nSearch a Certain E-Mail Acct.

Mot. at l). The Government\nnever advanced a theory that the illegal sexual activity identified in the S2 Indictment was sexual\nactivity that occurred outside New York.\n\nAt trial, the Government marshalled evidence that the defendant knouingly transported\nJane to New York, and aided and abeted Epstein in doing so, with the intent that Jane engage in\ncriminal sexual activity there in violation of New York law. That evidence included testimony\nfrom Jane in detail about Epstein’s New York residence (Tr. 3l6-l9) and specific sexual acts that\ntook place in New York while Jane was a minor (Tr. 3l9-2o). As the defendant rightly concedes,\n“most of [Jane’s] trips were to New York” and “the majority of Jane’s testimony about the trips\nconsisted of a description of Epstein’s house in New York and the sexual abuse she experienced\nthere.” (Def. Mot. at l3). The Government also offered significant corroborating evidence,\nincluding flight records and photographs of Epstein’s New York residence. On the conspiracy\ncounts, the Government also offered evidence that the defendant and Epstein transported another\nvictim, Virginia Roberts, to New York while she was a minor. (See, e.g. Tr. l862 (describing a\nflight from 2ool in which Epstein, the defendant, and Virginia flew from Maine to Teterboro, New\nJersey)).\n\nThe Government’s summation similarly discussed the Mann Act offenses as encompassing\nconduct directed at New York. The Government explained that Count Two “is about Jane and\n7\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo957o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009596.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 34of5l\n\nIt makes no difference, as the defendant argues, that both crimes involved grooming minors\nfor sexual abuse. (Def. Mot. at 23-24). As Dr. Rocchio testified at trial, the use of grooming\ntechniques is common among perpetrators of child sexual abuse. (See Tr. 7l3). But using a\ncommon tool among sexual offenders does not render the distinct conspiracies here multiplicitous;\nif that were true, presumably many federal crimes against children would be multiplicitous.\n\nThe Government was clear at trial that, while the defendant and Epstein commited crimes\ntogether for years, they did so through different schemes, in violation of different laws. That is\nwhat the S2 Indictment charged, and that is what the Government proved at trial: different\nconspiracy crimes. The Court should deny the motion and enter judgment on Counts Three and\nFive.\n\nIll. The Defendant’s Motion to Vacate Her Conviction and Dismiss the Indictment\nBased on Alleged Improper Pre-Trial Delay Should Be Denied\n\nThe defendant contends that the Court should vacate her conviction and dismiss the\nIndictment because the Government’s allegedly excessive delay in bringing the charges violates\nher due process rights. (Def. Mot. at 25). The defendant’s contention should be swiftly rejected.\nThe Court has twice evaluated the defendant’s speculative and baseless arguments and twice\nconcluded that the defendant could not meet the “stringent standard” <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to prevail on a\nclaim that any alleged pre-indictment delay violates her due process rights. (Dkt. No. 2o7 at l7;\nDkt. No. 3l7 at lo).

The Government notes that Juror 5o\ndoes not appear to have shared any of the details of his personal experience with\nsexual abuse in his interviews with media outlets. Moreover, Juror 5o’s counsel\nexpressed concern about Juror 5o’s privacy rights regarding disclosing intimate\ndetails of his experience as the victim of sexual abuse. (Dkt. No. 6o8 at 6-7). The\nGovernment further notes that the Court did not ask prospective jurors at voir dire\nto provide detailed accounts of their experiences with sexual abuse or sexual\nassault, and thus Juror 5o should not be required to give a detailed account of his\npersonal experiences, because the Court has already determined that such details\nare not <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to determining a juror’s qualifications and an inquiry mimicking\nthat which would have occurred during voir dire is consistent with the hypothetical\ninquiry called for by Second Circuit case law.

It is also <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for the Court to inquire about\nthe nature of the sexual abuse that Juror 5o experienced. Had Juror 5o disclosed in response to\nQuestion 48 that he was the victim of sexual abuse, he would have had to explain the nature of\nthat abuse in his response to the very next question. See Question 48a. Furthermore, it is\nimportant for the Court to explore the specifics of Juror 5o’s sexual abuse to determine hou\nsimilar his experience was to the experiences of the witnesses who testified at trial. See United\nStates v. Daugerdas, 867 F.

Ianniello, 866 F.2d 54o, 543\n(2d Cir. l989). While the Government consents to a hearing, its scope “should be limited to only\nwhat is absolutely <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to determine the facts with precision.” Jd. at 544. Such a hearing\nshould be limited to questioning of Juror 5o by the Court, in order to determine: (l) whether he\ndeliberately lied in response to Question 48, regarding being a victim of sexual abuse, and, if so,\n(2) whether the Court would have struck Juror 5o for cause if he had accurately responded to that\nquestion, i.e., based on a finding that he could not be fair and impartial.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nl. The Jury Selection Process\n\nBefore trial, the jury department for the Southern District of New York conducted five\nsessions over the course of November 4, 5, and l2, 2o2l during which 694 jurors completed a\njuror questionnaire approved by the Court.

The parties\nreviewed the completed questionnaires and then conferred, submiting a joint list delineating four\ncategories of prospective jurors: (l) prospective jurors that both the Government and defense\ncounsel agreed should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors that both the Government and\ndefense counsel agreed should be excused or struck for cause; (3) prospective jurors that defense\ncounsel, but not the Government, believed should be excused or struck for cause; and (4)\nprospective jurors that the Government, but not defense counsel, believed should be excused or\nstruck for cause. /d. at 2:22-3:4. In addition, the Court sent the parties a list of l3 prospective\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo98o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009830.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 32 of 49\nconduct which was similar to the charged offenses such that the juror may have felt that she was\n“confronting the legality of [her] oun past acts as well.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 48. While the Second\nCircuit held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in inferring bias under the\ncircumstances presented there, it also made clear that the district would not have erred in declining\nto infer bias. Jd. Torres thus underscores the ample discretion which district judges have in\nstriking jurors for cause—discretion which this Court has properly exercised not to infer bias\nwhere jurors have disclosed being victims of sexual abuse or harassment.\n\nThe defendant has failed to establish inferred bias.\n\nI. The Court Should Schedule a Limited Hearing Regarding Juror 5o\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nA post-verdict hearing into alleged juror misconduct is proper only where there is “clear,\nstrong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence . . . that a specific, non-speculative impropriety\nhas occurred.” United States v. Stewart, 59o F.3d 93, l33 (2d Cir. 2oo9) (quoting /anniello, 866\nF.2d at 543). This standard can only be met by “concrete allegations of inappropriate conduct that\nconstitute competent and relevant evidence,” though such allegations “need not be irrebutable\nbecause if the allegations were conclusive, there would be no need for a hearing.” United States\nv. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8) (quoting Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543).\n\nIn the rare instances where an inquiry into potential juror misconduct is warranted, the\nscope of the hearing must be narrouly tailored. The Second Circuit has emphasized that the\ninquiry “should be limited to only what is absolutely <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to determine the facts with\nprecision.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544. “A hearing is not held to afford a convicted defendant the\nopportunity to ‘conduct a fishing expedition.’” United States v. Sun Myung Moon, 7l8 F.2d l2lo,\nl234 (2d Cir. l983) (quoting United States v. Moten, 582 F.2d 654, 667 (2d Cir. l978)). Instead,\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo983o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009833.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 35 of 49\ninterviewed by the Court; the parties were permited to propose questions before and during the\nhearing.”), aff'd, 285 F.3d l58 (2d Cir. 2oo2).\n\nThat course of action is especially appropriate here for several reasons. First, the subject\nmater—the juror’s history of sexual abuse—presents a particularly high danger of harassment or\nembarrassment. Second, as noted above, the defendant’s brief is litered with information barred\nby Rule 6o6(b), suggesting a real danger she will seek to question Juror 5o about improper and\ninadmissible subjects. The Court should exercise its discretion to supervise the hearing by\nconducting the questioning itself.\n\nDn The Scope of the Hearing Should Be Limited\n\nThe scope of the hearing should be tightly limited to “only what is absolutely <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to\ndetermine the facts with precision.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544; see also Sun Myung Moon, 7l8\nF.2d at l234; Gagnon, 282 F. App’x at 4o.'4 Here, the only issues relevant under McDonough are\nwhether Juror 5o intentionally lied in response to Question 48, and whether Juror 5o was actually\nbiased against the defendant. No other subjects are appropriate for inquiry.’\n\n‘4 Tn particular, Juror SO cannot be asked to testify about what was said by any juror (including\nhim) in the jury room, or what his mental process was as a deliberating juror. He also cannot be\nasked whether he or any other juror discussed personal experiences with sexual abuse during\ndeliberations. Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b); Warger, 574 U.S. at 43-44 (“We hold that Rule 6o6(b) applies\nto juror testimony during a proceeding in which a party seeks to secure a new trial on the ground\nthat a juror lied during voir dire.”).\n\n'S For the reasons discussed above, the defendant has not met her burden with respect to Juror 5o’s\nvoir dire statements about his social media use and accordingly a hearing regarding such\nstatements is not warranted. Similarly, as discussed above, the defendant has also not met her\nburden with respect to whether Juror 5o answered Question 25 incorrectly, namely, whether Juror\n5o considers himself to be a victim of a crime. Houever, in the event that Juror 5o’s testimony at\nthe hearing regarding Question 48 makes clear that Juror 5o answered Question 25 incorrectly as\nwell, the Government would consent to the Court questioning Juror 5o regarding that question.\nHouever, that questioning should be limited in the same manner as discussed throughout with\nrespect to Question 48.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9833\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009834.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 36 of 49\n\nThis inquiry should be tightly focused. As a threshold mater, the Court should inquire\nwhether Juror 5o’s public statements are true—i.e., whether he was in fact a victim of sexual\nabuse.'® If the answer is yes, then the Court should determine why Juror 5o nevertheless answered\n“no” to Question 48. Finally, the Court should ask such questions as to permit it to make the\nhypothetical determination posed by McDonough’s second prong: If Juror 5o had accurately\nanswered Question 48, would the Court have struck him for cause?\n\nOn this last subject, the defendant claims that had Juror 5o answered Question 48 in the\naffirmative, the Court and the parties would have “probed” him about various topics, which the\ndefendant suggests are <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> topics of examination. (Def. Mem. at 44). The record refutes\nthat assertion, and inquiry along the lines proposed by the defendant is not <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>.\n\nThe defendant argues that the Court would have inquired whether Juror 5o was able to\nassess the credibility of a witness claiming sexual assault or abuse just like he would any other\nwitness. (/d.). As an initial mater, Juror 5o already stated in the juror questionnaire that he could\nassess the credibility of a witness claiming sexual assault or abuse just like he would any other\nwitness. (Def. Ex. l, Question 47). Moreover, the Court did not ask jurors who answered Question\n48 in the affirmative any follou up questions about Question 47. Accordingly, there is no need to\ninquire about this subject any further at a hearing, beyond perhaps reaffirming that Juror 5o’s\nanswer to Question 47 was correct.\n\n‘6 The Court need not inquire about the details of the victim’s sexual abuse, just as the Court did\nnot probe such details with respect to other jurors who answered Question 48 affirmatively. (See\nNov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l8-l9, 52-57, 2oo, 2o7-o8, 259, 293, 532, 635). In the event the Court\nbelieves that details need to be elicited, beyond those few details Juror 5o has provided publicly,\nsuch inquiry should be conducted at sidebar or in camera. See Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544; Shakur,\n723 F. Supp. at 928.\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9834\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009837.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 39 of 49\nMem. at 44). Instead, the questioning of Juror 5o should be limited to only what is strictly\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to determine the relevant issues.\n\n3. There Is No Basis to Call Any Other Juror as a Witness\n\nThere is no basis to call any other witness at a hearing aside from Juror 5o. The questioning\nof Juror 5o is sufficient to address the only questions as to which the rigorous standard for an\nevidentiary hearing has been met.\n\nThe defendant nevertheless proposes calling each of the twelve jurors for testimony about\nwhether they have experienced sexual abuse. (Def. Mem. at 5o, 57). It would be difficult to\nimagine a spectacle more damaging to the jury process than requiring each of the jurors to return\nto court weeks or months after their service was complete to testify about such a deeply personal\nand sensitive subject. The defendant’s request is exactly the sort of “fishing expedition” that\npresents the “evil consequences” of which the Second Circuit has repeatedly warned. See\nTanniello, 866 F.2d at 543; Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234.\n\nThe defendant’s request for such an inquisition is based on a single sentence in a newspaper\narticle, which reports that an anonymous “second juror described in an interview with The New\nYork Times having been sexually abused as a child.” See\nhtps://www.nytimes.com/2o22/ol/o5/nyregion/maxwell-trial-jury-inquiry.html.'7 It is\nquestionable that this report itself may be considered under Rule 6o6(b), insofar as the next\nsentence refers to the juror’s experience in the context of jury deliberations, so it is not clear from\nthe article whether the anonymous juror made any statements to the reporter that were separate\nThe defendant’s motion also states that Juror 5o has made public statements about another juror\nwho discussed experiences with sexual abuse in the context of deliberations. Rule 6o6(b)\nprecludes the Court from considering this. See Warger, 574 U.S. at 43 (affirming denial of motion\nfor a new trial under McDonough, where the only evidence of juror dishonesty was an affidavit\nfrom another juror regarding statements a juror had made during deliberations).\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9837\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009838.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 4o of 49\n\nfrom his or her discussion of deliberations. But even if it were properly considered, this one-\nsentence, hearsay report of an anonymous speaker is not a sufficient basis for dragging the entire\njury in for questioning at a hearing in an effort to root out the identity of this particular juror. As\nnoted, a hearing is warranted only where there is “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible\nevidence that a specific, non-speculative impropriety has occurred.” Stewart, 59o F.3d at l33-34\n(quotation omited). “Gossip and anonymous tips do not satisfy this standard.” United States v.\nStewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d 432, 443 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo4), aff'd, 433 F.3d 273, 3o6 (2d Cir. 2oo6). The\nSecond Circuit and courts in this district have thus repeatedly found that a hearing is not <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>\non similar facts.\n\nFor example, in United States v. Guzman Loera, a magazine article published shortly after\nthe verdict stated that an unnamed juror alleged that jurors folloued media coverage of the trial in\nviolation of the court’s instructions, and that they heard prejudicial information not admited\nduring the trial, including that the defendant had drugged and raped underaged girls. No. l9-2239,\n2o22 WL 2ll99, at *l2 (2d Cir. Jan. 25, 2o22). During trial, the district court had repeatedly\ninstructed the jury to avoid media coverage and on two occasions had canvassed the jury and spoke\nwith jurors individually about particular articles. /d. One juror acknouledged seeing the relevant\nheadline before turning away and another acknouledged seeing part of a headline before closing\nthe application. /d. & n.l5. The anonymous juror’s statements in the magazine article, houever,\nsuggested that the extent of juror exposure to this prejudicial media information was far more\nextensive, and that some jurors had discussed lying to the judge when he inquired about their\nexposure to that coverage. See Brief for Appellant, 2o2o WL 575793o, at *l57-*6l (2d Cir. Sept.\n4, 2o2o) (quoting article). Nevertheless, the district court concluded that the defendant had failed\nto meet his burden to establish that an evidentiary hearing was warranted, and the Second Circuit\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9838\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009841.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 43 of 49\n\nto become a “fishing expedition” but rather must limit the scope of any inquiry “to only what is\nabsolutely <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to determine the facts with precision.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543-44. It is\nhard to imagine a request more likely to “subject[] juries to harassment” and “inhibit juryroom\ndeliberation,” id. at 543, than the defendant’s request to compel production of a juror’s emails and\nother writen communications, as well as content from his Facebook, Twiter, LinkedIn, Instagram,\nand other social media accounts. (Def. Mem. at 48-49). Not surprisingly, the defendant cites no\nprecedent for this sweeping and invasive request. The Court should reject it.\n\nMoreover, each specific request is improper. Requests l(b) and l(c) call for\ncommunications between jurors and communications “about Juror No. 5o’s jury service,” and thus\ncall for information that, if it exists, is almost certainly inadmissible under Rule 6o6(b). Moreover,\nthe fact that Juror 5o made some public statements about his jury service does not give the\ndefendant license to compel the production of any statements he may have made to anyone—such\nas a friend or loved one—about his jury service. This is a classic fishing expedition and should\nnot be permited. Request l(a) calls for communications with victims and witnesses, but this too\nis a fishing expedition: Juror 5o’s public comment on a victim’s public Twiter post after trial does\nnot give the defense license to compel his private communications in the vague hope that, contrary\nto the Court’s instructions, he had some improper communications before or during trial. And\nRequest l(d) calls for communications about any payment Juror 5o received for media interviews,\nbut even if he received compensation for post-trial interviews that says nothing whatsoever about\nwhether the Court would have struck him for cause before trial based on his alleged experience\nwith sexual abuse.\n\nRequests 2(a) and 2(b) ask the Court to direct numerous social media companies to produce\nall communications to and from Juror 5o about his jury service and all posts or comments regarding\n4]\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo984l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009862.jpg": "l/26/22, 3:3oPM Case l:2o-cr-Oo@Makihfexwell @Ceays evitlefied Beaincedphad se Wd A2predatdr ADpay Malone\nISEMENT —_ Maxwell faced six counts relating to sex trafficking signed an earlier £37o,ooo ($5oo,ooo) legal setlement\nwhich centered on the stories of four victims. with pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, the duke's friend.\nA fifth victim, Kate, was called only to shou a patern of Miss Raberts, a6, ene af the bllkernsatn Sex effanicer’s\n. . : . . . most high-profile victims, claims she was trafficked by\ngrooming behavior and was not directly implicated in him and girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell to have sex with\nany of the counts.

Ms. Maxwell need not\nprove a deliberate falsehood. Jd.\n\nThe government all but ignores Stewart, relying on United States v. Shaoul, 4l F.3d 8ll\n(2d Cir. l994), in an effort to minimize Langford. The government’s invocation of Shaoul fails.\n\nFirst, Shaoul did not reject the argument Ms. Maxwell makes here. Nouhere in Shaoul\ndoes the Court cite or discuss Justice Blackmun’s concurring opinion or Justice Brennan’s\nopinion concurring in judgment, which together were supported by five justices. See Shaoul, 4l\nF.3d at 8l5-l7. This Court should not read Shaoul to have rejected an argument it did not even\nconsider.\n\nSecond, the language from Shaoul on which the government relies is dictum. That’s\nbecause the Shaoul Court held that the defendant could not “satisfy the second part of the\nMcDonough test—that the juror could have been challenged for cause.” /d. at 8l6. The Court’s\ndiscussion of deliberate-versus-inadvertent false answers thus was not <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to its\nconclusion, and this Court is not bound by it. Jama v. Immigr. & Customs Enf’t, 543 U.S. 335,\n352 n.l2 (2oo5) (“Dictum setles nothing, even in the court that uters it.”’).\n\nThird, if the government’s reading of Shaoul were correct, then Shaoul is inconsistent\nwith Langford, not to mention McDonough. Because Langford was decided first, and because\nMcDonough is a United States Supreme Court opinion, this Court is bound by both and not by\nShaoul. Compare United States v. Wilkerson, 36l F.3d 7l7, 732 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (one panel of the\nCourt of Appeals is “bound by the decisions of prior panels until such time as they are overruled\neither by an en banc panel of our Court or by the Supreme Court”), with Indep.

Juror No. 5o’s answers were deliberately false.\n\nEven so, the record more than supports the conclusion that Juror No. 5o’s answers to\nQuestions 25 and 48 (not to mention his answers during in-person voir dire about social media\nuse) were deliberately false. Juror No. 5o knew he was the victim of a crime. He was a\nprospective juror in a case where the accused was on trial for alleged sexual misconduct with\nminors. As the childhood victim of a sex crime, answering questions in a case about a childhood\nsex crime, there is no plausible explanation for why Juror No. 5o did not answer Question 25,\n“Yes.” The only believable answer is that he knew that answering that question “Yes” would\nlead to further questions like, what was the crime, which would then lead to questions about what\nhappened to him, which would end with his disqualification.\n\n® Greer, 285 F.3d at l73.\n\n7 A deliberately false answer by a juror in voir dire is thus neither <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> nor sufficient\nto entitle a defendant to a new trial. It’s not <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> because, if a biased juror actually serves\non a jury, structural error occurs, and a new trial is required even if the juror did not provide a\ndeliberately false answer during voir dire. Martinez-Salazar, 528 U.S. at 3l6; McDonough, 464\nUS. at 556-57 (Blackmun, J., concurring); id. at 557-58 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment);\nSmith, 455 U.S. at 2l5-l6; id. at 22o-24 (O’Connor, J., concurring); Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3;\nGreer, 285 F.3d t l7l-72; Langford, 99o F.2d at 68.

The cases relied on by the government are inapposite as none reach\nthe issue of whether a juror was dishonest in response to voir dire questions regarding whether\nthey had been the victim of the same type of crime at issue. See Resp. at 38-39. Importantly, the\ngovernment cites only to cases where the only evidence that a juror had engaged in misconduct\nwas a news article to that effect. Here, there are two pieces of evidence: one, the New York\nTimes article, and two, Juror No. 5o’s media statement that a second juror disclosed that they\nwere also a victim of childhood sexual abuse. Where there is \"clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence\" of juror misconduct, a hearing on that issue is required. United States\nv. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o2-o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6).\n\nThe government paints a parade of horrors to try to dissuade the Court from pursuing this\nsecond clear instance of a juror’s inaccurate voir dire statement on a critical issue in this case.\nResp. at 37. Yet simply asking the other ll jurors one question, whether they were the victim of\nchildhood sexual abuse is not the intrusion the government suggests; the juror apparently felt\ncomfortable sharing that information both during deliberations and also to the New York Times.\n\n4. Ms. Maxwell is entitled to Discovery\n\nThe government cites no authority for its request to foreclose discovery in advance of the\nhearing, nor could they given that such discovery is often <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to establish the very\nmisconduct at issue. The government’s complaints center on their view that the requested\ndiscovery is either overbroad or violative of Rule 6o6(b). The government intentionally mis-\nreads the defendant’s request. Obviously, Ms. Maxwell would be requesting communications\nthat occurred outside of deliberations. It is also surprising that the government thinks that there\nwill be a \"high volume\" of social media material during the \"relevant time frame,\" l.e., between\nwhen Juror No. 5o stated he had closed all of his accounts (a week before trial) and his\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9898\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009917.jpg": "Cas6 2k OCs PAB name r= ate FRO LSA Pa Peeper sib.

Conrad was admited to the practice of law in the State of New York by the Se-\ncond Judicial Department on January 26, 2ooo, and, at all times relevant to this proceeding, has maintained an office\nfor the practice of law within the First Judicial Department.\n\nIn a previous order dated December l8, 2oo7, this Court suspended respondent from the practice of law for fail-\nure to respond to requests made by the Departmental Disciplinary Commitee pursuant to its investigation of two\ncomplaints made against her (22 NYCRR 6o3.4[e][l][i] ). After receiving a response by respondent six months later\nseeking an opportunity to respond to the complaints, the Commitee conducted an investigation. Based upon re-\nspondent's admited problem with alcohol dependency, which she acknouledged was connected to her failure to\ncooperate and the underlying conduct, the Commitee obtained a psychiatric evaluation of respondent in November\n2oo9, and a subsequent re-evaluation in May 2olo. The psychiatrist determined that respondent's prognosis is good,\nbut did not go as far as to assert that she is nou fit to re-commence the practice of law.\n\nThe Departmental Disciplinary Commitee nou moves for an order suspending respondent from the practice of\nlaw on the ground that she suffers from a “disability by reason of physical or mental infirmity or illness” (22 NY-\nCRR 6o3.l6{c][l] ). In her cross motion respondent seeks to convert the current suspension to a medical suspension\nnunc pro tunc, but further seeks an order vacating the suspension and reinstating her to the practice of law, due to\nher year-long sobriety.\n\nThe Commitee's motion, and the first branch of respondent's cross motion, are granted to the extent that the\nprior finding of non-cooperation is vacated and an order **l89 of suspension based upon the atorney's medical dis-\nability is granted nunc pro tune (see Mater of Kaplan, 65 A.D.3d 287, 883 N.Y.S.2d l82 [2oo9]: Mater of Fusco,\nl8 A.D.3d 8l, 798 N.Y.S.2d 364 [2oo5] ).\n\n[l][2] Houever, that branch of respondent's cross motion seeking immediate reinstatement is denied at this\ntime. The cross motion itself concedes the existence of the alcohol dependence rendering her unfit to practice law;\nadditionally, she acknouledged during her deposition that her failure to cooperate and *l7o her underlying conduct\nwas related to alcoho! dependency. To support her cross motion, respondent implies that the examining psychiatrist\nfailed to satisfy an obligation to establish that she continues to be unfit to resume her practice, Houever, to be enti-\ntled to reinstatement, since the initial infirmity has been conceded, it is respondent who must prove her fitness to be\nreinstated (see 22 NYCRR 6o3.l6[f] ), and that burden is not satisfied here by her oun self-assessment (see Mater\nof Stewart, 47 A.D.3d 43, 846 N.Y.S.2d l3 [2oo7] ). The branch of respondent's cross motion seeking reinstatement\nto the practice of law therefore must be denied at this time, without prejudice to a further application, supported by\nan evaluation by a mental health provider atesting to her current fitness to re-commence the practice of law (see\nMater of Supino, 23 A.D.3d ll, l4, 8o6 N.Y.S.2d l78 [2oo5] ).\n\nAccordingly, the Commitee's motion and respondent's cross motion should be granted to the extent that the pri-\nor order's finding of non-cooperation is vacated, and respondent is suspended from the practice of law for an indefi-\n© 2ol] Thomson Reuters.

Also relevant is New York Rule 3.5(d), which provides: |\nA lawyer shall reveal promptly to the court improper conduct by a member\nof the venire or a juror, or by another touard a member of the venire or a juror or a\nmember of his or her family of which the lawyer has knouledge.\n9. Each of these rules requires knouledge on the part of the lawyer, and that knouledge\nmust be “actual” knouledge. The standard is a subjective one. New York Rule l.o(k) contains\nthis definition:\n_ Knouingly, knoun, knou, or knous denotes actual knouledge of\nthe fact in question. A person’s knouledge may be inferred from circumstances. !\nlo. A leading Second Circuit case addresses the knouledge requirement. In Doe v. Federal\nGrievance Commitee, 847 F.2d 57 (2™ Cir. l988), a district judge in Connecticut disciplined a\nlawyer who did not report his belief that an opposing witness had lied in a deposition. The\nConnecticut (and the New York) rule at the time required a “lawyer who receives information\nclearly establishing that...[a] person other than his client has perpetrated a fraud upon a tribunal\n* | have also been asked to address the potential relevance of Rule 8.4(d) of the New York Rules, which\nsays that a “lawyer or law firm shall not...engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the\nadministration of justice.” This rule should not be read to expand Rule 3.3’s mens rea\nrequirement of knouledge. When the New York Rules of Professional Conduct were adopted to\nreplace the Code of Professional Responsibility, the courts chose the standard of “knouledge,”\nthe same standard as in the ABA Model Rules, to replace “clearly established,” which the Second\nCircuit had already interpreted to mean “knouledge” (see l lo-ll infra). When a specific and\nconsidered rule requires knouledge, another and general rule should not be interpreted to\nimpose a duty based on a louer standard. There would be obvious notice and fairness interests\nimplicated in doing so. ;\nDOJ-OGR-ooolol28\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010185.jpg": "CaSasP2COAR CES DARN l Beno rraniGaee® o Fibs PAPO? ab ate eH dfll/l 7\nA-593o\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o4 _ Filed o3/l6/l3 Page l of l4\n7 4l85 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS 3lST FLOOR\nNEW YORK, NY loo36-26o3\ny.

Stated differently,\nthe government agrees that if the jury found that Ms. Maxwell intended for Jane or the other\nvictims of the Mann Act conspiracies to engage in sexual activity in some place other than New\nYork, such as New Mexico, that would not be sufficient, by itself, to convict Ms. Maxwell of the\nMann Act counts. (Opp. at 6-7 (“As the defendant correctly states ... ‘it was <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to prove\nthat [the defendant] enticed or caused underaged girls to travel to New York, or conspired to do\nthe same, with the intent that they would engage in illegal sexual activity that violated New York\nlaw.’” (quoting Mot. at l) (emphasis in original)).\n\nSimilarly, the government does not dispute that, for purposes of a constructive\namendment analysis, Ms. Maxwell’s intent to have Jane or the other victims of the Mann Act\nconspiracies engage in sexual activity within the state of New York that violated New York law\nwas an “essential element” of Counts One, Three, and Four, and part of the “core of criminality”\nfor those charges. (Opp. at 6 (“That is the core of criminality charged in the S2 Indictment, and\nit is what the Government proved at trial and the Court captured in its jury instructions.”’)). The\nonly dispute is whether “the evidence or jury instructions at trial created a substantial likelihood\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo27l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010274.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 647 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 8of24\nUnder the second element of Count Four, can the defendant be found guilty if the\ndefendant’s intent was for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico and if\nthe defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s return flight from New Mexico,\nbut not the flight to New Mexico?\n\nHence, the question posed by the Jury Note contained two parts. The jury wanted to knou if it\nwas sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count Four if it found (l) that Ms. Maxwell’s\nintent was for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, and (2) that Ms. Maxwell\nassisted with Jane’s return flight from New Mexico, but not her flight to New Mexico. That is\nthe straightforward, common sense reading of the Jury Note.\n\nThe answer to the first part of the jury’s question is an unequivocal no. The jury\ninstruction for the second element of Count Four charged that the government had to prove\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Ms. Maxwell “knouingly transported Jane in interstate\ncommerce with an intent that Jane engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged\nwith a criminal offense in violation of New York law.” (Instr. No. 2l (emphasis added)). It was\ntherefore not sufficient to satisfy this element if the jury found that Ms. Maxwell intended for\nJane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico. Any sexual activity that occurred in New\nMexico could not, by definition, be a violation of New York law.\n\nAccordingly, the Jury Note revealed that the jury had a fundamental misunderstanding of\nthe intent requirement under Count Four. The jury needed to be given a supplemental instruction\nclarifying that to convict under Count Four, they needed to find that Ms. Maxwell intended for\nJane to engage in sexual activity in New York and that any sexual activity that occurred in New\nMexico, while it was potentially relevant evidence, could not have violated New York law. The\nCourt’s decision to simply refer the jury to the existing jury instruction for the second element of\nCount Four did nothing to cure the misunderstanding because the jury already had those\ninstructions and was still evidently confused about the proof <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to satisfy Count Four. As\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo274\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010277.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Pagellof 24\nnote asking a similar question about Annie Farmer’s testimony. See Court Exhibit # 9 (“Can we\nconsider Annie’s testimony as conspiracy to commit a crime in Counts One and Three?”). But\nthe Jury Note did not say that, nor did it contain the phrase “in part.” Instead, the Jury Note\nasked a much more specific question about whether the jury could convict Ms. Maxwell on\nCount Four if it found that she (l) intended for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico\nand (2) aided with Jane’s return flight from New Mexico, but not her flight to New Mexico. The\ngovernment’s speculation about what the jury may have meant cannot alter the clear text and\nmeaning of the Jury Note, which revealed that the jury fundamentally misunderstood the intent\nrequirement <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for Count Four and needed to be given a supplemental instruction to\nremedy the confusion.?\n\nB. The Court Erred When It Declined to Give the Jury a Supplemental\n\nInstruction Clarifying the Intent Requirement for Count Four.\n\nThe Court further erred when it declined to give the jury a supplemental instruction, as\nrequested by the defense, clarifying the intent requirement for Count Four — namely, that the\ngovernment had to prove that Ms. Maxwell intended for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New\nYork. The Jury Note shoued not only that the jury had a mistaken understanding of the law\nconcerming intent, but also indicated that the jury might convict Ms. Maxwell on Count Four\nbased an alternative theory of guilt not charged in the Indictment. At that point, it was the\nresponsibility of the Court to give the jury a supplemental instruction “to enable it to assess the\nevidence within the proper legal framework and to reach a rational verdict” and to avoid a\nconstructive amendment of the charges. Parker, 9o3 F.2d at lol; see also Gross, 2ol7 WL\n3 The government chides the defense for engaging in speculation about what the jury may have been thinking before\nsending the Jury Note. (Opp. l7-l9). The defense engaged in that discussion to explain why the proof at trial may\nhave led the jury to focus on Jane’s testimony about the conduct in New Mexico with respect to Count Four. But the\nCourt need not rely on that analysis. The Jury Note speaks for itself. The jury was focused on Jane’s abuse in New\nMexico and misunderstood the intent requirement <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to convict under Count Four.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo277\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010279.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Pagel3 of 24\nwithin the state of New York. (See Instr. No. l7, l9, 2l). To lawyers, that may seem obvious\nbecause we are familiar with the concept of jurisdiction and understand the limited territorial\nreach of state criminal statutes. But to a juror who does not have legal training, it is not so\nobvious. Based on the jury instructions they had been given, the jury could have easily (but\nmistakenly) determined that the sexual abuse Jane described in New Mexico was “sexual activity\nfor which any person can be charged with a criminal offense in violation of New York law,” as\nlong as it met all the elements of Section l3o.55, even though all of the conduct took place in\nNew Mexico. It follous, then, that the jury could have mistakenly believed that if they found\nthat Ms. Maxwell intended for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, as opposed to\nNew York, that was sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count Four.\n\nUltimately, it is not <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to determine why the jury was confused on this point. The\nconfusion was clear on the face of the Jury Note and needed to be corrected. The defense’s\nproposed supplemental instruction would have clarified this very issue. It stated in relevant part:\n\nAs to the second element of Count Four, you must determine whether the\n\nGovernment has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant transported\n\nJane with the intent that Jane would engage in sexual activity within the state of\n\nNew York in violation of New York Penal Law l3o.55.\n\nDkt. 566 (emphasis added). The defense further explained that the instruction needed to be\ngiven because, according to the Jury Note, the jury did not understand that Count Four “requires\nan intent to violate New York law, and you can’t violate this section of New York law in New\nMexico.” (Tr. 3l54) (emphasis added). But the Court declined to give this instruction, even\nthough neither the Court nor the government questioned its accuracy. (Tr. 3l48-54).+ The\n* The Court disagreed with the appropriateness of the first paragraph of the defense’s proposed instruction and\nquestioned the accuracy of the third paragraph. But neither the Court nor the government challenged the accuracy of\nthe second paragraph, which is quoted above. (Tr. 3l48-54). Moreover, even if the Court disagreed with the entire\ntext of the defense’s proposed instruction, it was the Court’s responsibility to give the jury an appropriate instruction\nthat clarified the intent requirement and prevented a constructive amendment.\n\n9\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo279\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010309.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 649 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Page3ofl2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Juror 5o had answered\n“No.” (/d.). Although Juror 5o initially claimed that this was an accurate response because he\ndid not consider his stepbrother a “family member,” Juror 5o eventually admited that this was\nnot an accurate answer and that the truthful answer was “Yes (friend or family member)”\nbecause a stepbrother is a family member and Juror 5o’s mother reported the stepbrother’s sexual\nabuse to the police when Juror 5o disclosed it to her several years after it happened. (Tr. 8-9, ll-\nl3).\n\nAccordingly, the record is clear that several of Juror 5o’s voir dire responses were false,\nsatisfying the first prong of the McDonough test. See United States v.

Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 556 (l984)).'\n\nII. Had Juror 5o Answered the Questions Truthfully, He Would Have Been Struck for\n\nCause\n\nThe Court must next consider whether the correct responses to the voir dire questions\nwould have provided Ms. Maxwell with a valid basis to challenge Juror 5o for cause. See\nStewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3. The Court must determine whether Juror 5o was capable of being an\nimpartial, unbiased juror “capable and willing to decide the case solely on the evidence before\nl Ms. Maxwell reiterates her position that it is not <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for the false statement to be intentional or deliberate to\nsatisfy the first prong of the McDonough test. See Motion at 23-28; Reply at 9-lo. Nevertheless, the record\nestablishes that Juror 5o’s false statements were intentional. (See discussion infra). Even if the Court determines\nthat they were not, and that Af/cDonough requires an intentional false statement, Ms. Maxwell is still entitled to a\nnew trial based on Juror 5o’s bias. See Skaggs v.

In an\nOpinion & Order dated February 25, 2o22, the Court denied the Defendant’s motion for a new\ntrial on the current record and determined that a hearing was <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to resolve the motion.\nThe Court ordered an evidentiary hearing limited to instances supported by clear, strong, and\nincontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety had occurred—namely, a\nfalse statement during jury selection. The hearing was also limited by Federal Rule of Evidence\n6o6, which bars the Court from receiving evidence of a juror’s statements regarding what\noccurred during jury deliberations. Fed. R.

As he repeatedly explained, he never expected or even hoped to\nbe selected. The Court finds Juror 5o’s testimony to be credible, forthright, and responsive and\ndoes not find as a factual mater that Juror 5o deliberately lied in order to be selected as a juror.\n\nThe Defendant’s reliance on Sampson v. United States, 724 F.3d l5o (lst Cir. 2ol3), is\nsimilarly unavailing. See Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at ll. There, a juror failed to disclose that\nher husband had previously threatened her with a shotgun during jury selection for a bank\nrobbery case in which the defendants threatened the bank tellers at gunpoint. Houever, the juror\nhad told a “litany of lies” during voir dire bearing on a number of issues, including her\ndaughter’s incarceration and her oun substance abuse issues. /d. at l6l-62, l68. By contrast,\nJuror 5o’s inadvertent nondisclosure, while implicating multiple questions on the questionnaire,\nstems only from his experience of sexual abuse.\n\nSecond, the Defendant contends that Juror 5o was biased due to the “similarities between\n[his] personal experiences . . . and the issues being litigated.” Maxwell Br. at 3o (quoting\nDaugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472). She expressly disavous arguing “that every person who has\nbeen a victim of sexual assault or sexual abuse was subject to a ‘mandatory’ challenge for cause\nbased on implied bias.” Maxwell Reply at l7. Distancing from that position is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>—\nagain, it is not the law that an individual with a history of sexual abuse cannot serve as a fair and\nimpartial juror. Rather, the Defendant finesses the argument by saying that Juror 5o’s personal\nhistory is sufficiently similar to the issues at trial so as to warrant a mandatory finding of implied\nbias, or alternatively, a discretionary finding of inferred bias, and points to Juror 5o’s testimony\nand post-trial statements as evidence that these purported similarities made him biased.

Nor\nwas the jury asked to make a specific finding as to the end date of the offense conduct.

Ms. Maxwell has\nalready learned a painful lesson from her arrest and prosecution, has lost her marriage and her\nstepchildren, and has been harshly punished during pre-sentence incarceration. Ms. Maxwell\nhas already shoun that she will not reoffend and does not need to be further deterred from\ncommiting crimes in the future.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo465\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010466.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 _ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 2o of 77\n\nNor can general deterrence be used to justify a harsh sentence for Ms. Maxwell. Probation\nidentifies two groups of potential offenders who will purportedly be deterred from commiting\nfuture crimes as a result of Ms. Maxwell’s sentence: (l) sexual predators who exploit and degrade\nminor victims and (2) “untouchable individuals who feel their privilege and affluence entitle them\nto victimize others without fear or consequence.” PSR at 67. With regard to the first group, courts\nhave expressed legitimate doubt as to whether people who have a sexual predilection for minors\ncan be deterred at all. See, e.g., United States v. D.M., 942 F. Supp. 2d 327, 346 (E.D.N.Y. 2ol3)\n(“[T]he compulsive behavior and disorders motivating many offenders is less susceptible to\ngeneral deterrence.”). With regard to the second group, the purported justification sweeps far too\nbroadly. Rather than identify a particular class of similarly situated defendants who will be\ndeterred from commiting specific crimes, Probation essentially makes the sweeping assertion that\na harsh sentence for Ms. Maxwell is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to deter rich people from exploiting poor people.\nSee PSR at 67. That is not the purpose of general deterrence and should not be given any weight\nin determining the appropriate sentence.\nA Belou Guidelines Sentence Would Provide Just Punishment, Promote Respect for the\nLaw, and Avoid Unwarranted Sentencing Disparities\n\nWhile the offense conduct is indisputably serious, the record reflects that Epstein was the\nmain offender. Given the foregoing discussion, a shorter term of incarceration for Ms. Maxwell\nbest serves the long-term goals of punishment. A significantly belou-guidelines sentence in this\ncase would also promote respect for the law by demonstrating that the justice system considers\neach person who comes before the Court as an individual. A sentence tailored to Ghislaine\nMaxwell’s particular circumstances—would appropriately distinguish between this defendant and\nmore culpable individuals similarly charged. See United States v. Dorvee, 6l6 F.3d l74, l87 (2d\nCir. 2olo) (“[C]Jourts must guard against unwarranted similarities among sentences for defendants\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo466\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010481.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document663_ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 35of 77\n\nmore than prisoners in mainstream conditions, it follous that proportionality requires the severity\nof confinement be factored into sentencing. Courts sentence convicted offenders to prison as\npunishment. Courts order pretrial defendants detained to safeguard the community and to ensure\npresence at court proceedings, not for punishment. In evaluating the nature and extent of\npunishment, it is important to factor in the actual impact of the hardship on the defendant. If\ndetention imposes an additional burden on a certain category of defendants, it is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to\nincorporate the actual total burden of the punishment into sentencing calibrations.\n\nThe principle of proportionality requires that the additional burden experienced by Ms.\nMaxwell during the 22 months spent is in supermax-type conditions should be factored into the\nCourt’s sentencing calculus. Based on the underpinnings of punishment and the principle of\nproportionality, a hard-time credit for Ms. Maxwell’s unusual detention is warranted.\nImprisonment in any form is a severe hardship. This is especially so when a person presumed to\nbe innocent is detained pretrial. The standard measure for evaluating the hardship of incarceration\nis the length of the prison term, i.e., a value is placed on this quantitative measure when assessing\ndamages for wrongful conviction. Regardless of whether there is an objective mathematical\nformula for Ms. Maxwell’s unique situation, a meaningful credit is warranted.’\n\nThere is a manifestly stark qualitative difference in the degree of deprivation, restriction,\nand punishment between the first 22 months of Ms. Maxwell’s detention and her current detention\nin general population. Her detention in isolation — de facto solitary confinement comparable to\n27 Compensation determinations for individuals wrongfully incarcerated is illustrative. Thirty-six states and\nWashington, DC, have laws that offer compensation for exonerees. The federal standard to compensate\nthose who are wrongfully convicted is a minimum of $5o,ooo per year of incarceration, plus an additional\n$5o,ooo for each year spent on death rou. See htps://www.congress.gov/bill/] l7th-congress/house-\nbill/4ol9/text?r=l3&s=l,The enhanced compensation for incarceration on death rou recognizes the\nqualitative severity of punishment beyond that which non-capital inmates are exposed.\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo48l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010558.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 23 oof55\nemployees was unnecessary. The book is authentic, and the defendant offers no basis for\nconcluding otherwise.”\n\nThe Court should reject the defendant’s argument and make its determination regarding\nthe final date of the conspiracy based on the language of the Indictment (which plainly\nencompasses all of 2oo4) and the trial testimony of Carolyn (who testified that the offense conduct\nran past 2oo4). The 2oo4 Manual applies.\n\n3. The Court Should Apply the 2oo4 Manual\n\nThe defendant also claims that the “goals of sentencing are not served” by applying the\n2oo4 Manual. (Def. Mem. 8 (capitalization removed)). Not so. The law plainly provides that the\n2oo4 Manual applies here, and it would be unjust to provide a substantial break in the Sentencing\nGuidelines for a defendant who engaged in an extensive child exploitation scheme, especially\nwhen both Congress and the Sentencing Commission have since further increased the applicable\npenalties for these offenses.\n\nMoreover, the Court should not credit the defendant’s claim that she broke away from\nEpstein in 2oo2, based on the testimony of a sole defense witness who said that the defendant had\n“moved on” in 2oo2. (Def. Mem. 9).

It is well established that hearsay is admissible at sentencing.\nSee United States v. Martinez, 4l3 F.3d 239, 242 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (“the right of confrontation does\nnot apply to the sentencing context and does not prohibit the consideration of hearsay testimony\nin sentencing proceedings.”).\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo558\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010562.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 27 of 55\n\n82 (2d Cir. 2oo8) (same). Specifically, when evaluating whether the “otherwise extensive” prong\napplies, the sentencing court must consider “(i) the number of knouing participants; (i) the\nnumber of unknouing participants whose activities were organized or led by the defendant with\nspecific criminal intent; (ill) the extent to which the services of the unknouing participants were\npeculiar and <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to the criminal scheme.” Carrozzella, lo5 F.3d at 8o3-o4. In seting out\nthese factors, the Circuit emphasized that “[t]he number of knouing participants” is “relevant” to\nthe analysis “because a criminal scheme with four knouing participants that is aided by unknouing\nparticipants is more likely to be ‘otherwise extensive’ than a scheme with a single knouing\nparticipant.” Jd. at 8o4. Additionally, when evaluating the number of unknouing participants, the\nCircuit emphasized distinguishing between service providers, such as taxi drivers, from individuals\nwho function more like knouing participants who receive direction from a defendant “with the\nspecific intent” to further the criminal activity.\n\nIn this analysis, the Circuit did not articulate or rely on any requirement that a defendant\nmust have supervised at least one knouing participant. Jd. Rather, the Court expressly\ncontemplated that the enhancement might apply to an organization involving multiple unknouing\nparticipants. See id. Consistent with that understanding, and contrary to the defense’s proposed\ninterpretation, the Circuit has affirmed the application of § 3Bl.l under the “otherwise extensive”\nprong to two defendants who were themselves the only two knouing participants identified in the\nscheme. Rubenstein, 4o3 F.3d at 99. That outcome makes clear that the Circuit does not require\na defendant to supervise any other knouing participant in the scheme. Of particular note, the\nRubenstein case applied the “otherwise extensive” enhancement” where the two knouing\nparticipants worked together, with one serving as a “right-hand man” to the other, while they\norganized “as many as seven participants who were unknouing,” who worked under the\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo562\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010563.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 28 of 55\ndefendants’ direction. Rubenstein, 4o3 F.3d at 99. The same analysis applies with equal force\nhere. Even if the defendant and Epstein were the only two knouing participants—which, as\ndiscussed belou, they were not—their joint supervision and organization of a large array of\nunknouing participants created an otherwise extensive organization that qualifies for the\nenhancement under U.S.S.G. §3Bl.l.\n\nHere, the defendant acted as an organizer and leader of a massive operation that spanned\nmany years. In operating as the lady of the house and as Epstein’s right hand, the defendant was\nresponsible for overseeing and organizing extensive logistics involved in facilitating the sexual\nabuse of multiple minors and ensuring a culture of silence that prevented that scheme from being\nuncovered. Epstein and the defendant were two knouing participants who took the lead in\nidentifying, enticing, and grooming minor girls to be abused. Additionally, Sarah Kellen, who\nhandled the responsibilities of scheduling sexualized massages and took nude photographs of\nCarolyn (PSR § 66; Tr. l554-55), constituted a third knouing participant, which number the\nCircuit has found sufficient, together with additionally <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> unknouing participants, to be\nsufficient for the enhancement. See Archer, 67l F.3d at l66.\n\nBeyond those three knouing participants, Virginia and Carolyn both recruited other minor\ngirls to provide paid sexualized massages to Epstein, thereby furthering the scheme and filling a\ncrucial role in the scheme’s later pyramid phase. Juan Alessi provided an essential role\ntransporting Jane and Virginia to see Epstein, as well as scheduling appointments for massages,\ncleaning up the massage room after Epstein received sexualized massages, and puting away sex\ntoys in the defendant’s bathroom after Epstein received sexualized massages. (PSR 9] 24, 57; Tr.\n836-38). Those duties were essential both to the continued functioning of the scheme, by ensuring\nthat minor girls were available to be abused, and to the avoidance of detection by ensuring that\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo563\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010564.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 29 of55\nsomeone who had been trained not to ask questions and who worked in a culture of silence carried\nout those <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> tasks. Both Larry Visoski and David Rodgers played the essential role of\ntransporting minor victims to different locations, providing a discreet means of ensuring that\nEpstein had access to minor girls for his sexual gratification when he traveled. The defendant\norganized all of those individuals by telling Virginia to shou Carolyn what to do, by scheduling\nCarolyn’s appointments, by giving Alessi innumerable directions, and by providing instructions to\nboth pilots. (PSR [fj 24, 62, 66). Additionally, the defendant supervised all of Epstein’s staff for\nyears, thereby running an extensive operation. Those individuals more than satisfy the definition\nof an extensive operation in which the defendant served as an organizer.\n\nIn any event, this enhancement applies even under the defense’s interpretation of U.S.S.G.\n§ 3Bl.l because Maxwell also supervised at least one other knouing participant in Sarah Kellen.\nLarry Visoski testified that he understood Sarah Kellen to be one of Maxwell’s assistants. (Tr.\nl4o). Even if he was not certain that Kellen had that precise title, his understanding is consistent\nwith Maxwell’s role as second in command beneath Epstein over all other employees. (Tr. l39).\nConsistent with Visoski’ s recollection, David Rodgers testified his understanding was that “Sarah\nwas more of Ghislaine’s assistant, but actually she was probably both,” an assistant to the\ndefendant and an assistant to Epstein, again confirming that the defendant supervised Kellen. (Tr.\nl89o). Rodgers also testified that Maxwell was “number two” belou Epstein among Epstein’s\nemployees. (Tr. l8o9-lo). Alessi testified that he did not knou exactly what Kellen’s job\nresponsibilities were, but Kellen took over the “scheduling of massages” in approximately 2oo2.\n(Tr. 833). Carolyn also recalled that even after Kellen took over calling to schedule massages,\nMaxwell was still present inside the Palm Beach residence when Carolyn arrived for massage\nappointments. (Tr. l527). Moreover, the household manual makes clear that as of 2oo5, Maxwell\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo564\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010577.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 42 of 55\nexplained: “This toxic combination of being sexually exposed and exploited, feeling confused and\nnaive, blaming myself all resulted in significant shame.”\n\nKate has explained that “the consequences of what Ghislaine Maxwell did have been far\nreaching for me.” In a leter to the Court in connection with sentencing, Kate shared: “I have\nstruggled with, and eventually triumphed over, substance use disorder. I have suffered panic\natacks and night terrors, with which I still struggle. I have suffered lou self esteem, loss of career\nopportunities. I have batled greatly with feeling unable to trust my oun instincts, in choosing\nromantic relationships.”\n\nCarolyn’s testimony at trial made clear that she, too, has suffered greatly as a result of the\ndefendant’s crimes. Over her years of abuse at Epstein’s hands, Carolyn fell deeper into drug\naddiction, and she has experienced significant struggles with mental health and addiction\nthroughout her adult life. (PSR §] 59). When explaining the trauma she experienced, Carolyn\nexpressed, “my soul is broken and so is my heart.” (Tr. l678). Her pain was palpable on the\nwitness stand as she described the horrifying years of abuse she suffered.\n\nAs the foregoing makes clear, the defendant played an essential role in a child exploitation\nconspiracy that caused lasting harm to many young girls. The defendant preyed on vulnerable\nyoung girls, manipulated them, and served them up to be sexually abused by Epstein, a prolific\npredator and abuser of children. Years of sexual abuse, multiple victims, devastating\npsychological harm: none of this could have happened without Maxwell. A Guidelines sentence\nis <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to reflect the gravity of the offense conduct and the pain and trauma the defendant\ninflicted upon her many victims.\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo577\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010580.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page 45of55\nfor exactly what it is: a desperate atempt to shift the blame for her oun crimes and distract from\nthe gravity of her offense conduct.\n\nIn short, the defendant has lied repeatedly about her crimes, exhibited an uter failure to\naccept responsibility, and demonstrated repeated disrespect for the law and the Court. The\ndefendant’s history and characteristics weigh in favor of a Guidelines sentence.\n\n3. The Need to Promote Respect for the Law and to Afford Adequate Deterrence\n\nThe importance of promoting respect for the law and affording adequate deterrence further\nsupports imposing a sentence within the Guidelines range. Given the magnitude, breadth, and\nsophistication of the conduct in this case, those interests are best served by a significant term of\nimprisonment. The defendant’s patern of exploitative conduct, and her lies to evade responsibility\nfor her crimes, should be met with punishment that holds her accountable for the full measure of\nher criminal conduct and the abuse and horror for which she is responsible.\n\nA Guidelines sentence would also deter those who would facilitate sexual abusers in\npositions of pouer. As the Government has emphasized throughout this case, Jeffrey Epstein\ncould not have commited these crimes without the defendant. The defendant, an adult woman,\nwas able to provide a cover of respectability to Epstein that lulled the victims and their families\ninto a false sense of security. This case sends the important message that those who would conspire\nwith sexual predators will be held responsible for their significant role in these crimes.\nAccordingly, a Guidelines sentence is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to afford deterrence.\n\nThe lenient sentence the defendant seeks would send the message that there is one system\nof laws for the rich and pouerful, and another set for everyone else. It would also send the message\nto victims that, even if they have the courage to report their abusers and undergo the excruciating\nexperience of testifying in court, there will be no meaningful accountability.

I worked at Henri Bendel until graduation.\n\nIn the fall semester of my senior year at FIT Ghislaine Maxwell came into the store, where\nshe was a frequent customer. Her usual salesperson wasn’t there so I helped her. Ghislaine was\nelectrifying and we hit it off immediately. In this first meeting we spoke of our mutual love of fashion,\nof difficult fathers and formal upbringings, of boyfriends and of hou we both saw New York as a\nchance to start over. She told me that her boss (who I later came to understand was Jeffrey Epstein)\nwas Close friends with Les Wexner, the CEO and Founder of The Limited, which ouned Henri Bendel\nat the time. When she completed her purchases, I offered to deliver them to her, so she didn’t have\nto carry them around all day. This was a courtesy I frequently extended to my high-end clients. Later\nthat day, I called her office for delivery instructions and was told to bring them to the Pierre Hotel\nclose by the store. When I arrived, the hotel concierge told me Ms. Maxwell was in the bar and wanted\nme to meet someone. It was Jeftrey Epstein. That night in the hotel was the first of many times they\nsexually assaulted me.\n\nAfterwards, I tried to pretend everything was normal.

Pyramid Co. v. Onondaga,\n435 F.3d llo, l2l (2d Cir. 2oo6). Once the right ataches, it is overcome\nonly by a shouing that there are “countervailing factors” that outweigh the\npublic’s right to monitor judicial proceedings.\nDefendant’s Motion for New Trial.

The juror questionnaires are judicial documents\nbecause they are relevant and useful to the performance of a judicial\nfunction: selecting a jury, a <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> component of a criminal trial. Here,\nthe presumptive right to access to these questionnaires is at its apex. In\neffect, the sealing of the questionnaires is the equivalent of barring the\npublic from the oral voir dire. Defendant’s motion requests a new trial\nbecause of alleged juror misconduct—and specifically, that “a juror failed\nto answer honestly a material question on voir dire.” Dkt. 57o. Juror 5o’s\nquestionnaires will thus, as Defendant recognizes, id., necessarily and\ndirectly affect the Court’s decision on whether the existing finding of guilt\nshould be vacated and whether a new trial is appropriate—fundamental\nArticle III determinations. See Amodeo I, 44 F.3d at l45. The\nquestionnaires for the remaining seated jurors are integral to determining\nwhether this is a lone or recurring incident.\nAny original need for sealing the questionnaires for the seated jurors—for\ninstance, that they might be subject to atempts to influence their\ndeliberations—has nou passed. The trial is over, and the jurors have been\ndismissed.\nThe First Amendment Right of Access\nAn independent First Amendment right of access ataches where public\naccess to a document has historically been available (the “experience”\nprong) and would be valuable to the process in question (the “logic”\nprong).

As set forth above,\nFlatley’s testimony does not constitute expert opinion, and thus no notice was required. But even\nif some aspect of Flatley’s testimony were considered expert opinion, the Government’s notice\nwas sufficient, for the reasons set forth above. Furthermore, the purpose of Rule l6’s expert notice\nrequirement is to “minimize surprise that often results from unexpected expert testimony, reduce\nthe need for continuances, and to provide the opponent with a fair opportunity to test the merit of\nthe expert’s testimony through focused cross-examination.” Fed. R. Crim. P. l6(a)(l)(G),\n(b)(l)(C), l993 Amend. Here, the Government’s notices have clearly served the purpose of the\nrequirement. The defendant cannot seriously claim surprise: When the Government first provided\nnotice of Flatley’s testimony in September, the defendant did not object to its sufficiency or file a\nmotion to preclude, but instead noticed her oun counter-expert to Flatley on November l, 2o2l,\nstating that he would testify about substantially the same subjects. Moreover, the first time the\ndefendant raised any complaint about notice, the Government responded in great detail within\nthree days, and the defense then chose to wait until the night before Flatley’s testimony to raise\nany further complaint with the Court.

That\nsupplement was untimely. Thus, we intend to object at trial to the admission of any opinions\nfrom Mr. Flatley not included in your September l5, 2o2l disclosure. This supplement for\nMr. Kelso does not purport to respond to anything contained in your Flatley supplement.\n\nWe anticipate that Mr. Kelso will testify about the meaning of certain pieces of\nmetadata associated with computers and computer files, such as “Authors,” “Last saved by,”\n“Registered Organization,” and “Registered Owner” and potentially others. Mr. Kelso will\ntestify about where the data contained in these types of metadata fields originates and hou it\npropagates. Mr. Kelso will testify that a particular value in one or more of these metadata\nfields, such as a version of person’s name, does not necessarily mean that person authored the\nunderlying documents or had any interaction with the documents. This testimony may cover\nany exhibits offered by the Government.\n\nMr. Kelso's testimony may also encompass the metadata associated with defense\nexhibits, including testimony about the values contained in certain metadata fields and their\nmeaning. Because the defense cannot anticipate at this juncture which exhibits may be\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>, depending upon evidence offered by the government during its case in chief, the\ndefense reserves the right to disclose the metadata testimony from Mr. Kelso at the same time\nit identifies any particular exhibit that it will introduce as impeachment or rebutal exhibits.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll95\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011211.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o3 Filed o7/l2/22 Page6of7\n\nThird, this failure to disclose has caused prejudice to the Government.

Again, before her testimony, Kate had told the government two different stories\nabout where Ms. Maxwell lived in l994—at a home in the Kensington neighborhood, or at the\nKinnerton Street home in the Belgravia neighborhood.

The government’s complaints are overwrought. For one thing, the\ngovernment had investigators in the United Kingdom investigating Ms. Maxwell’s college\nrecord.

Here, to the extent the\n“ther” in Ms. Moe’s email refers to Jane, Jane gives no such informed consent.

They are relevant because they\n\n8 confirm that Epstein's practice was, in fact, to prefer girls\n\n9 dressed as schoolgirls and to have people wear schoolgirl\n\nlo outfits. So it is directly corroborative of Kate's testimony\nll on that score.\n\nl2 They're additionally relevant because they confirm an\nl3 issue, which defense has put it, in dispute in this case, that\nl4 Jeffrey Epstein did, in fact, have a sexual preference for\n\nl5 schoolgirls. That point has been vigorously disputed at trial.\nl6 These exhibits confirm that that in fact was the case and\n\nl7 corroborates the testimony of Kate that she was in fact asked\nl8 to wear such an outfit.\n\nl9 Similarly to the Court's ruling with respect to Jane's\n2o testimony and the descriptions of the massage room, here, it's\n2l not <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for a witness to talk about the particular\n22 details of a schoolgirl costume.

As to Counts Two, Four, and\n\niy Six, therefore, the defendant can be convicted either if she\n\n6 commited the crime herself or if another person commited the\n7 crime and the defendant aided and abeted that person to commit\n8 that crime.\n\n9 Under the federal aiding and abeting statute, whoever\nlo \"aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, or procures\" the\n\nll commission of an offense is punishable as a principle.

I am to take into account the kinds of\n\nl7 sentences available, as I have said, the guideline range, any\nl8 pertinent policy statement, the need to avoid unwarranted\n\nl9 sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who\n2o have been found guilty of similar conduct, the need to provide\n2l restitution as appropriate under the law to any victims of the\n22 offense.\n23 I am required to impose a sentence sufficient, but no\n24 greater than <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>, to comply with the purposes I have just\n25 described.

(“MSW Media”), I respectfully submit this leter motion\nto intervene in the above-captioned case for the purposes of partially supporting and partially\nopposing the Government’s motion to unseal the transcripts of grand jury testimony in this case,\nfiled as Docket No. 785.\n\nMSW Media (htps://mswmedia.com/) operates numerous podcasts and blogs about\nfederal government operations, including Mueller She Wrote, SpyTalk, Daily Beans, and Jack. It\nclearly qualifies as a representative of the news media.\n\nMSW Media has standing to intervene in this case for the follouing reason. On l7 July\n2o25, after President Donald Trump publicly instructed Atorney General Pam Bondi to seek the\nCourt’s permission to release “any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, we filed a Freedom of\nInformation Act (“FOIA”) request with the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) for transcripts of all/\ngrand jury testimony from this case and United States v. Epstein, No. l9-49o (S.D.N.Y.). We are\nconcerned with the modifier “pertinent” in President Trump’s instruction, and that concern\nseemed vindicated when the Government advised this Court that it intended to “make\nappropriate redactions of victim-related information and other personal identifying information\nprior to releasing the transcripts.” (Dkt. #785 at 2 (emphasis added).)\n\nTo be clear, we have no interest in victim-related information, and this Motion does not\npertain to that information. Houever, we do have concerns that the Government seems to be\nimplicitly seeking this Court’s permission to withhold other personally identifiable information,\nsuch as information about Defendant’s partners in crime or clients. Accordingly, while we join\nthe Government in requesting that these transcripts be released, we accordingly make this narrou\nindependent request to the Court: Please do not weigh in on the appropriateness of withholding\npersonally identifiable information unrelated to victims.

The Maxwell grand\njury met on June 29, 2o2o, July 8, 2o2o, and March 29, 2o2l.\n\nThird, the Government has provided the Court with all substantive exhibits from the grand\njury presentations in each of the Epstein and Maxwell cases that it currently has in its possession.\nThe Government respectfully submits under seal to Judge Berman one additional grand jury\nexhibit from the Epstein case that it referenced in its leter to the Court but did not have readily\navailable at that time.\n\nFourth, in connection with this leter, the Government respectfully submits to Judge\nEngelmayer under seal and ex parte a version of the Maxwell grand jury transcripts that\nspecifically identifies which information in the transcripts is not, as far as the Government is aware,\npublicly available. As previewed in the Government’s submission of July 29, 2o25, many of the\nvictims and witnesses testified at trial consistent with the accounts offered in the grand jury by\ninvestigating law enforcement witnesses. The enclosed, annotated transcripts shou that much of\nthe information provided during the course of the grand jury testimony—with the exception of the\nidentities of certain victims and witnesses—was made publicly available at trial or has otherwise\nbeen publicly reported through the public statements of victims and witnesses. !\n\nFifth, the substantive grand jury exhibits are not currently part of the public record. The\nGovernment, houever, is undertaking to identify for the Court any specific portions of the grand\njury exhibits that are reflected in the public record. In doing so, the Government endeavors to\ncompare the exhibits against the voluminous public and sealed exhibits offered at the Maxwell\ntrial and to review certain relevant civil litigation dockets of which the Government is aware to the\nextent such dockets are publicly available. The Government respectfully requests leave of the\nCourt to supplement this leter no later than August 8, 2o25, in order to respond to item 4 of Judge\nBerman’s Order and item 2 of Judge Engelmayer’s Order.\n\nSixth, the nolle prosequi filed in the Epstein case does not impact the proposed disclosure.\nWhile the Supreme Court has noted—in a different context—that a Court’s “jurisdiction end[s]”\nwhen “a nolle prosequi [is] entered,” Ex parte Wilson, l4o U.S. 575, 583 (l89l), it did so in the\ncontext of a court having the ability to enter a judgment. To the contrary, at least one court has\nexplicitly held that a nolle prosequi does not deprive a court of the authority to determine whether\nto disclose sealed grand jury minutes. United States v. Byoir, 58 F. Supp. 273, 274 (N.D. Tex.),\n' Although there was no public trial of Epstein, the Government is prepared to do a similar\nanalysis regarding the Epstein grand jury transcripts if Judge Berman believes it would assist in\nthe Court’s analysis of the /n re Craig factors related to the Government’s motion in Epstein.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o8l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015082.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8oo _ Filed o8/o5/25 Page4of4\n\nHon.

Bartels, 532\nF. Supp. 973, 978-79 (S.D.N.Y. l982) (ordering limited disclosure of sealed grand jury testimony\nafter entry of a nolle prosequi). Houever, the fact that Epstein passed away—which was the basis\nfor the entry of the nolle prosequi—is a factor to be considered. See Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo6\n(2d Cir. l997) (noting that “the current status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings and\nthat of their families” is a factor “that a trial court might want to consider when confronted with\nthese highly discretionary and fact-sensitive ‘special circumstances’ motions”).\n\nSeventh, regarding the Government’s approach to victim notification of the instant\nproceedings, as noted in its July 29 submission, the Government has provided notice of the\nunsealing motions to all but one of the victims who are referenced in the grand jury transcripts at\nissue in the motions. The Government still has been unable to contact that remaining victim. With\nrespect to victims who are not identified in the grand jury transcripts but who have previously\nreceived victim notifications in the Maxwell and Epstein maters, the Government will over the\ncoming days alert those victims to the fact of the unsealing motions.\n\nFinally, in light of the Government’s ongoing efforts to ensure that that the interests of\nvictims and other third parties are appropriately considered, as well as the multifaceted nature of\nthese and other relevant proceedings, it may be <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> or appropriate for the Government to\nmodify or supplement the information provided today, and the Government commits to doing so\nas promptly as practicable.\n\nAs always, the Government is available to answer any questions the Court may have.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n\nPAMELA J.

Ms.\nFarmer is thankful for the Court’s invitations to state the victims’ positions, and supports the\nunsealing of the grand jury transcripts, as well as the accompanying grand jury exhibits, with\nredactions only as <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to protect victims’ names, likenesses, and identifying information.\nTransparency is critical to justice, and the public has a legitimate interest in understanding the full\nscope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, particularly where those actions caused lasting harm to\nothers. While it was not the victims’ decision to seek disclosure of the grand jury transcripts alone\n(as opposed to the much larger volume of information available in the “more than 3oo gigabytes\nof data and physical evidence” in the Government’s possession that should be disclosed as well),\nthe instant motion for unsealing will help expose the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes.\n\nIn this case that involved a decades-long, systematic criminal scheme that shocked the\nconscience of the public, caused lasting harm to survivors, and raised credible concerns about the\nfailures of institutional accountability, there is an especially compelling interest in transparency.\nUnsealing the grand jury transcripts will illuminate the scope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s abuse,\nprovide additional insight into those who enabled his abuse, and bring light to hou these crimes\nwere investigated and prosecuted. While grand jury secrecy serves important purposes, it is not\nabsolute and under these circumstances the balance tilts in favor of disclosure.\n\nl. Given the Magnitude and Abhorrence of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s Crimes, the\n\nUnsealing of the Grand Jury Transcripts Is Appropriate.\n\nThe Second Circuit has recognized that there are special circumstances when the release\nof grand jury records is appropriate based on the courts’ supervisory authority over the grand juries\nthey empanel and that the trial court has “wide discretion ... in evaluating whether disclosure is\nappropriate.” In re Petition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2, lo4 (2d Cir. l997). In Craig, the Second\nCircuit outlined a non-exclusive list of factors that a trial court may consider when deciding\nwhether “special circumstances warrant the release of grand jury transcripts.

Why Disclosure Is Being Sought in Particular Case\n\nGrand jury secrecy may serve legitimate purposes in ordinary cases, but this is no ordinary\ncase. In addition to the public interest that the Government identifies, Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 4-5,\ndisclosure of the grand jury transcripts in this case serves the interest of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s\nvictims in bringing light to Epstein’s and Maxwell’s horrific crimes. This transparency and\naccountability is a form of justice. Epstein is the world’s most notorious sex offender, and his\ncrimes span decades, with thousands of victims. Epstein was a calculated predator who preyed on\nminors and young women using wealth, deceit, and manipulation. Maxwell, his righthand woman,\nplayed a central role in recruiting, grooming, and trafficking Epstein’s victims, oftentimes\nparticipating in the abuse. Her participation, and the complicity and participation of others,\nenabled Epstein to conduct a decades-long sex-trafficking scheme.\n\nGiven the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein and Maxwell’s crimes, unsealing the grand\njury transcripts is not just appropriate, it is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to understand the full scope of the abuse and\nthose who enabled it. For years, victims of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes have been silenced,\nfearful of the repercussions of exposing the many pouerful individuals in Epstein’s network, many\nof whom have not yet been named or investigated. Unsealing the grand jury transcripts would\nallou additional important information to emerge without requiring the victims to expose\nthemselves to the same ridicule, retaliation, and humiliation they would face if they were the ones\nto expose such information. The Government itself acknouledged that there are “over one\nthousand victims,” ? yet only a small fraction—approximately one-fifth—have received\ncompensation, underscoring the continuing lack of full accountability for Epstein, Maxwell, and\ntheir co-conspirators. The interests of the victims should therefore weigh in favor of disclosure.\nSee Mater of Aiani v. Donovan, 98 A.D.3d 972, 974 (2d Dep’t 2ol2) (ordering disclosure of\nbanking records requested in connection with grand jury proceedings based on the interests of the\nvictims).\n\nB. Whether Witnesses to the Grand Jury Transcripts Who Might Be Affected by\n\nDisclosure Are Still Alive\n\nThis factor considers whether individuals who may be affected by the disclosure of grand\njury materials may be adversely impacted by unsealing. This case presents a rare and compelling\ncircumstance where the victims seek transparency, not secrecy. In In re National Security Archive,\nfor example, where the proceedings held substantial historical importance and the living witnesses\ndid not express any objection to the release, the Court found that the release of grand jury testimony\nwas appropriate. 2oo8 WL 8985358, at *l-2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2oo8). The victims represented\nby the undersigned counsel who are still alive do not just passively support unsealing, but\n3 See U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Memorandum (July 6, 2o25),\n\n: htps://www.justice.gov/opa/media/l4o7ool/dl?inline.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oool5lo5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015111.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o4 _ Filed o8/o6/25 Page l6 of 27\nHonorable Paul A. Engelmayer\nCase No.: l:2o-cr-oo33o (PAE)\n) Page 3\n\nsome, the Maxwell conviction is the only meaningful measure of criminal accountability;\n\nits erosion would be devastating.’\nOf significant concern, the same government that failed to provide notice to the victims before\nmoving this Court to unseal the grand jury materials is nou the government representing to this Court\nthat it has provided appropriate notice to the victims or their counsel and has conducted a proper\nreview and redaction of the materials it seeks to release. Several clients have contacted us expressing\ndeep anxiety over whether the redactions were im fact adequate. Consequently, we requested\nyesterday that the government identify which of our clients were referenced to the grand jury. The\ngovernment responded promptly and provided clarification. Houever, we have strong reason to\nbelieve that additional individualsk-whom we also represent—were likely referenced in those\nmaterials but were not identified to us by the government.\nIt remains unclear whether notice was mstead provided to prior counsel, whether their omission was\na government oversight, whether the government does not consider them to be victims, or whether\nthese individuals were, in fact, not mentioned to the grand jury. Regardless of the explanation, this\nambiguity raises a serious issue that must be resolved before any materials are publicly released.\nAgainst this backdrop, any disclosure of grand jury material—especially material that could expose\nor help identify victims in any way—directly affects the CVRA’s fairness, privacy, conferral, and\nprotection guarantees. To ensure those rights are protected, it is essential that the protocol outlined\nmn the relief requested belou is adopted by this Court.\n\nII. Rule 6(e) and Eleventh Circuit Authority Require Heightened Caution and Narrou\n\n‘Tailoring.\nGrand jury secrecy is a “long-established policy” safeguarded by Rule 6(e). Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol\nStops Nw., 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l9-23 (l979). Even where disclosure may be considered, the movant\nmust establish a particularized need that outweighs the countervailing interests in secrecy, and any\ndisclosure should be no broader than <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>. /d. at 222-23. The Eleventh Circuit has further\nheld that district courts Jack mberent authority to order grand jury disclosure outside the exceptions\nin Rule 6(e). Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d l226, l237-388 (llth Cir. 2o2o) (en banc); see also\nMcKeever v. Barr, 92o F.3d 842, 845-46 (D.C. Cir. 2ol9).\nHere, even if the Court were to find a Rule 6(e) path to limited disclosure, victims’ CVRA rights and\nthe traditional interests protected by grand jury secrecy converge in favor of extraordinary care:\nrigorous judicial screening, robust redactions, minimization of any risk of re-identification, and\nmeaningful victim participation before anything is made public. Related privacy provisions reinforce\n' Several victims have already died by suicide, drug overdose, or under tragic circumstances tied directly to\nthe trauma caused by Epstein and Maxwell. The psychological toll of this abuse is ongoing. A pardon, issued\nm silence or secrecy, would reignite deep trauma, destabilize the already-fragile healing process of many\nsurvivors, and could result in further irreparable harm—including loss of life. It would suggest to victims\n\n\\ everywhere that pouerful predators are once agai above the law.\nDOJ-OGR-Ooool5ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015112.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o4 _ Filed o8/o6/25 Page l7 of 27\nHonorable Paul A.

Requested Relief\nIn light of the foregoing, the victims respectfully request that the Court:\n\nl) Require Conferral and Notice (CVRA §§ 377l(a)(5), (c)\\(l)): Direct the Government to\nconfer with victims’ counsel and provide reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard\nbefore any ruling on unsealing or public release of grand jury materials.\n\n2) Judicial In Camera Review: Conduct a comprehensive in camera review of the grand jury\nmaterials to determine whether the proponent has shoun a Rule 6(e)-compliant basis for any\ndisclosure and, if so, the narrouest scope of disclosure consistent with Douglas Oil\n\n3) Victims’ Counsel Pre-Release Review (Under Protective Order): Permit designated victims’\ncounsel to review the government’s proposed redactions and any index of materials under a\nstrict protective order, to allou victims’ counsel to identify and prevent: (a) direct identifiers,\n(b) combinations of data pomts that could reasonably lead to re-identification or harassment\nof victims, and (c) to propose all additional redactions <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>.\n\n4) Dispute Resolution before Unsealing or Release: If the government does not agree with\nadditional proposed redactions from victims’ counsel, provide victims’ counsel the\nopportunity to be heard on any dispute before ruling on unsealing or public release.\n\n5) Defer or Deny Without Prejudice if Safeguards Cannot Be Assured: If adequate safeguards\ncannot be implemented consistent with Rule 6(e), Prech, and the CVRA, deny disclosure\nwithout prejudice.\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nThe survivors support transparency when it can be achieved without sacrificing their safety, privacy,\n\nor dignity. But transparency cannot come at the expense of the very people whom the justice system\n\nis sworn to protect—particularly amid contemporaneous events that magnify risk aud trauma: the\n\npublic platforming of Ms. Maxwell as a purportedly credible commentator despite her sex-trafficking\nconviction and perjury charges, her transfer to louer-security custody, a government request to unseal\n\nfiled without conferral, and the looming specter of clemency.\n\nThese survivors have already endured profound violations of their rights and dignity, both during\n\nthe years of Epsteim’s abuse and in the years follouing.

Several schoolgirl outfits were recovered from\n\na Jeffrey Epstein's residence in 2ol9.\n\n6 Here, the fact that they were schoolgirl outfits is\n\n7 obvious from Looking at them. They are relevant because they\n\n8 confirm that Epstein's practice was, in fact, to prefer girls\n\n9 dressed as schoolgirls and to have people wear schoolgirl\n\nlo outfits. So it is directly corroborative of Kate's testimony\nll on that score.\n\nl2 They're additionally relevant because they confirm an\nl3 issue, which defense has put it, in dispute in this case, that\nl4 Jeffrey Epstein did, in fact, have a sexual preference for\n\nl5 schoolgirls. That point has been vigorously disputed at trial.\nl6 These exhibits confirm that that in fact was the case and\n\nl7 corroborates the testimony of Kate that she was in fact asked\nl8 to wear such an outfit.\n\nl9 Similarly to the Court's ruling with respect to Jane's\n2o testimony and the descriptions of the massage room, here, it's\n2l not <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for a witness to talk about the particular\n22 details of a schoolgirl costume.

The\nDefendant’s request is DENIED on this basis.\n\nIndeed, good cause for the requested modification of the protective order is further\nlacking because, as far as this Court can discern, the facts she is interested in conveying to the\njudicial decisionmakers in the Civil Cases are already publicly available, including in the\nGovernment’s docketed leter on this issue. See Dkt. No. 46. In the opening paragraph of her\nreply leter dated August 24, 2o2o, the Defendant states that she is essentially seeking to disclose\nunder seal to certain judicial officers the follouing factual information:\n\nl. Grand jury subpoenas were issued to an entity (“Recipient”) after the Government\nopened a grand jury investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and his possible co-\nconspirators;\n\n2. The Recipient concluded that it could not turn over materials responsive to the grand\njury subpoena absent a modification of the civil protective orders in the civil cases;\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oool926o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019271.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 5-2, o9/o9/2o2o, 2927755, Page8 of l2\n\nthe United States may access the live audio feed by calling 2l4—4l6—o4oo and using\nthe same access code and PIN.

RRPSS/L872oe PAGE 2 of 3\nThe Honorable Debra C. Freeman\nMay l8, 2o2o\nPage 2\n\nFurther, Maxwell has provided no information about the subject mater of the criminal\ninvestigation into Epstein’s co-conspirators, the status of the investigation, or even disclosed\nwhether she herself is a target of the Southern District’s investigation. When Plaintiff’s counsel\nasked Maxwell’s counsel for information about the criminal investigation during their meet and\nconfer, Maxwell’s counsel refused to provide any details. “A civil defendant urging such a stay\n[pending a parallel criminal prosecution] bears the burden of establishing its need.” Rex & Roberta\nLing Living Tr. v. B Commce’ns Ltd., 346 F. Supp. 3d 389, 4oo (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8) (internal quotation\nmarks omited). Maxwell therefore cannot use the existence of a criminal investigation to dodge\nher discovery obligations in this mater, particularly while at the same time refusing to provide any\ndetails or reasons as to why the investigation is a reason to stay the action under the law of this\nCircuit.\"\n\nSecond, the potential claims resolution program does not justify a stay of discovery. As\nthis Court knous, the program cannot go forward due to the current criminal activity lien on Jeffrey\nEpstein’s Estate in the U.S. Virgin Islands (“USVI”). See Tr. of Feb. ll, 2o2o Conf. at 36:l5-l8\n(“[T]he two cases where discovery has been stayed, in light of what’s happening in the Virgin\nIslands, they may end up unstayed.”). But even if the lien were lifted and the program could go\nforward tomorrou, both Epstein’s Estate (Maxwell’s co-defendant) and this Court have recognized\nthat victims would still not be required to stay discovery in their cases in order to participate in the\nprogram. Tr. of Feb ll, 2o2o Conf. at 6:lo—l8 (Estate explaining that staying litigation is not\nrequired in order to participate in the program); Tr. of Feb ll, 2o2o Conf. at l7:2-3 (Court\nrecognizing that Defendants cannot ask victims to stay their cases in order to participate in the\nprogram); Tr. of Nov. 2l, 2ol9 Conf. at 26:lo—ll (“The default in this Court is that it does not\nstay discovery.”). Accordingly, this Court has not stayed any other action against Jeffrey Epstein’s\nEstate in light of a potential claims administration program unless all the parties agreed to such a\nstay, and there is no reason to treat this case differently merely because Maxwell is named as a\nDefendant in addition to the Estate. Further, this Court has recognized that some discovery might,\nin fact, be <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to inform the claims resolution program. Tr. of Nov. 2l, 2ol9 Conf. at\n27:8—ll (“[I]t may be that you need discovery in the litigation to have in hand certain discovery\nbefore you can figure out the right setlement for a particular case.”).\n\nMaxwell also contends that if the program moves forward and Plaintiff chooses to\nparticipate, Maxwell will be released from liability for sexually assaulting Plaintiff when she was\na child. But, again, the contours of the program have not been finalized. Even if the program\nmoves forward and even if Plaintiff chooses to participate, it is not clear that Maxwell would be\nreleased for her torts against Plaintiff. In fact, the scope of the release that participants in the\nprogram would be required to sign is the very issue, and the sole issue, that the USVI Atorney\nGeneral and Epstein’s Estate are still negotiating. See Co-Executors’ Corrections to Atorney\nl The pending criminal investigation did not inhibit Maxwell from filing her oun lawsuit\nagainst the Estate for indemnification, even though her criminal conduct would be directly at issue\nin that case, and the case would require discovery concerning such conduct. Maxwell v. Estate of\nJeffrey E. Epstein, et al., ST-2o-CV-l55 (V.I. Super. Ct.); Willie v. Amerada Hess Corp., 66 VI.\n23, 92 (Super. Ct. 2ol7) (common law indemnification is only available “where an innocent party\nis held vicariously liable for the actions of the true tortfeasor” (emphases in original) (internal\nquotation marks and citations omited)).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool93l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019319.jpg": "Case £49% 9ol 6495.osustent Bodine 72o, RRPSS/L872oe PAGE 3 of 3\nThe Honorable Debra C.

The claims resolution program is therefore not a\nvalid basis to stay this action without Plaintiffs consent.”\n\nThird, Maxwell contends that her motion to dismiss is “strong and warrants a stay of\ndiscovery pending its resolution.” Plaintiff has already addressed the merits of Maxwell’s motion\nto dismiss in her response to Maxwell’s leter requesting a pre-motion conference on that motion.\nECF No. 48. Judge Schofield’s words at the pre-motion conference—in which she suggested that\nMaxwell’s counsel not file a motion to dismiss—speak for themselves, and demonstrate that\nMaxwell’s motion to dismiss is anything but “strong”: “I’ve reviewed the leter from defendant\nMaxwell’s counsel, and this particular motion doesn’t strike me as any more meritorious” than the\none previously contemplated by the Estate, which eventually filed an Answer in lieu of a motion\nto dismiss after a similar pre-motion conference before Judge Schofield. Tr. of Apr. l6, 2o2o\nConf. at 3:22—24. Further, this Court has explicitly stated that the default in this Court is that\ndispositive motions do not stay discovery, which is also consistent with Judge Schofield’s\nindividual rules. Tr. of Nov. 2l, 2ol9 Conf. at 26:lo—l2; Judge Schofield’s Individual Rule HI.C.2.\n(“Absent extraordinary circumstances, the Court does not stay discovery or any other case\nmanagement deadlines during the pendency of a motion to dismiss.”). Maxwell’s anticipated\nmotion to dismiss should not stay discovery in this mater, just as the Estate’s motions to dismiss\nhave not stayed discovery in any other mater against it in this District.\n\nThe Court should deny Maxwell’s motion for a pre-motion conference, and deny her\nanticipated motion to stay discovery in this mater in its entirety.

Ghislaine Maxwell, No. l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP)\nDear Judge Preska:\n\nI write in response to the Court’s Order of August 3, 2o2o (Doc. lo69), the Order and\nProtocol for Unsealing Decided Motions (Doc. lo44) (“Protocol”), and to raise with the Court\nthe legal effect of new information that came to the atention of counsel for Ms. Maxwell on\nFriday, August 7, 2o2o.\n\nNew information: On Friday, August 7, 2o2o, counsel for Ms. Maxwell learned of\ncritical new information that impacts both this action and U.S. v. Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n(the “Criminal Action”). The information implicates Ms. Maxwell’s right to due process and\nfairness in this civil action and affects the Second Circuit’s review of the Court’s unsealing\norder of July 23, 2o2o. Additionally, the information implicates her rights as a criminal\ndefendant guaranteed under the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\n\nCounsel makes the representations about implications of the new information as an\nofficer of this Court. At this time, counsel is not at liberty to disclose the information because\nit is subject to a protective order in the Criminal Action, which forbids its use “for any civil\nproceeding or any purpose other than the defense” of the criminal action absent “further order\nof the Court.” Protective Order, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN) at {¥ l(a), l8 (Exhibit A). As required by\nthat Protective Order and Judge Nathan’s Individual Practices in Criminal Cases, counsel\ninitiated a conferral with the U.S. Atorney’s Office over the weekend concerning a\nmodification of the Protective Order to share the information with this Court and the Second\nCircuit. Barring agreement, Ms. Maxwell intends to seek modification of the Protective Order\nin the Criminal Action from Judge Nathan forthwith to permit sharing the information with\nthis Court, ex parte and in camera if <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>, and with the Second Circuit (likewise under\nseal if <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool932l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019322.jpg": "Cas@ nS 2i-O7aA Bose Buceim ae l7oo2 Filed2o3/9B/2agPage 2 of 3\nHonorable Loreta A.

Subject to Ms. Maxwell’s request to temporarily pause the process as described\nabove, defense counsel has agreed to several potential modifications of the Protocol which we\nhope will ease the burden on the parties and the Court going forward, should the unsealing\nmove ahead. Of note, and as Plaintiff will explain to the Court, the parties have agreed to\nnotify all of the Non-Parties at once so that we can understand which Non-Parties object to the\nunsealing before deciding hou to proceed with future redactions. Although this will give the\nCourt and the Original Parties more information about the scope of objectors, there are\nlimitations to the extent to which it will expedite the process. As counsel has made clear in\nthe past, it will take significant effort by the Original Parties and their staff to put together the\nexcerpts for any Non-Party who requests them because each Non-Party will be entitled to see\nhis or her oun information (but not that of other Non-Parties). After receiving a request from\na Non-Party, we anticipate it will take up to a week per Non-Party to agree to the excerpts to\nsend to them for review. But on balance we agree that having a sense of the number of\nparticipating Non-Parties will aid the Court in conducting future proceedings, we have agreed\nto Plaintiff's suggestion on that front. The parties can submit a proposed modification of the\nProtocol and Notice to the Court to reflect this agreement.\n\nWe also have agreed, as the Court suggested, to shorten the time period for the\nOriginal Parties to object and to respond from l4 to 7 days. This would impact paragraphs\n2(d), 2(e) and 2(f) of the Protocol. The parties can also submit a proposed modification of the\nProtocol to the Court. The parties also agreed to leave the time for Non-Parties to object at l4\ndays given some practical considerations applicable to them.\n\nAlthough the parties were able to reach some agreement, we cannot agree to all of\nPlaintiff's proposals and write separately to explain the basis for our disagreements.\n\nFirst, we carefully considered the Court’s suggestion to reduce the number of pages of\nbriefing to ten pages per side. /d. Our initial Objection (DE lo57) was l4 pages long;\nPlaintiff’s Response was l9 pages. The Court concluded that our Objection was, in many\nrespects, not specific enough. We would ask leave to at least have l5 pages to object to the\nfive motions proposed belou, with any response limited to the same. We will endeavor to\nkeep it shorter than that, but also allou for more space to provide specifics to the Court.\n\nSecond, we have obtained new contact information for Doe l from a separate civil\nsuit. We believe that Doe l retains a right to notification and participation. We suggest\n\nDOJ-OGR- oool9322\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019330.jpg": "Casmat2ooc8oo33o- culm eDoeaneil GLORleADHA2/ CP agagebot 5\ncase in other civil proceedings.

But after fourteen single-spaced pages of heated\nrhetoric, the Defendant proffers no more than vague, speculative, and conclusory assertions as to\nwhy that is the case. She provides no coherent explanation of what argument she intends to\nmake before those courts that requires the presentation of the materials received in discovery in\nthis criminal mater under the existing terms of the protective order in this case.

In sum, the\narguments the Defendant presents to the Court plainly fail to establish good cause. The\nDefendant’s request is DENIED on this basis.\n\nIndeed, good cause for the requested modification of the protective order is further\nlacking because, as far as this Court can discern, the facts she is interested in conveying to the\njudicial decisionmakers in the Civil Cases are already publicly available, including in the\nGovernment’s docketed leter on this issue. See Dkt. No. 46. In the opening paragraph of her\nreply leter dated August 24, 2o2o, the Defendant states that she is essentially seeking to disclose\nunder seal to certain judicial officers the follouing factual information:\n\nl. Grand jury subpoenas were issued to an entity (“Recipient”) after the Government\nopened a grand jury investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and his possible co-\nconspirators;\n\n2.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully request that the Court enter a\nprotective order in the form atached hereto as Exhibit A.\n\nThe government has indicated that it requires the entry of a protective order before\nproducing any discovery material to Ms. Maxwell. On July 9, 2o2o, the government provided\ndefense counsel with an initial draft of a proposed protective order. Since that time, the parties\nhave conferred several times on conference calls and by email, and have been able to reach\nagreement on almost all of the provisions of the proposed protective order.\n\nTwo key disputes remain, houever, which require the Court’s guidance. First, the\ndefense believes that potential government witnesses and their counsel should be subject to the\nsame restrictions as the defense concerning appropriate use of the discovery materials—namely,\nif these individuals are given access to discovery materials during trial preparation, they may not\nuse those materials for any purpose other than preparing for trial in the criminal case, and may\nnot post those materials on the Internet. Second, the defense believes it should not be restricted\nfrom publicly disclosing or disseminating the identity of any alleged victims or potential\nwitnesses referenced in the discovery materials who have already identified themselves by\nspeaking on the public record.\n\nAs set forth belou, we believe that the proposed protective order contains appropriate\nrestrictions that are no broader than <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to protect the privacy interests of individuals\n\nApp.o39\nDOJ-OGR-oool9498\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019499.jpg": "OGsedl AZADA S BOs ATT thd MAE 2o2 F ib 2AY/PagPkyefi2l ab4\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 27, 2o2o\nPage 2\nreferenced in the discovery and guard against prejudicial pretrial publicity, while still ensuring\nthat Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel may adequately prepare and present a full defense at trial.\nLegal Standard\n\nWhere the government seeks to curtail the use of pretrial discovery, Rule l6(d)(l) of the\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires that it “shou good cause for the issuance of a\nprotective order.” United States v. Annabi, No. lo Cr. 7 (CM), 2olo WL l25322l, at *l\n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2olo). To establish that good cause exists for proposed restrictions in a\nprotective order, the government must shou that disclosure will cause “a clearly defined and\nserious injury.” United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d l94, 2ll (3d Cir. 2oo7). A finding of harm\n“must be based on a particular factual demonstration of potential harm, not on conclusory\nstatements.” United States v. Gangi, l998 WL 226l96, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 4, l998) (citations\nand internal quotations omited). “Broad allegations of harm, unsubstantiated by specific\nexamples or articulated reasoning, do not support a good cause shouing.” Wecht, 484 F.3d at\n2ll.\n\nCourts must be careful not to impose a protective order that is “broader than is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>”\nto accomplish its goals. United States v. Lindh, l98 F. Supp. 2d 739, 742 (E.D. Va. 2oo2)\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited). Thus, courts are instructed to “weigh the\nimpact” of requested protections and their extent against a defendant’s “due process right to\nprepare and present a full defense at trial.” Jd.\n\nDiscussion\n\nl. Restrictions on Use of Discovery Materials\n\nThe government and the defense agree that the protective order should include a\nrestriction prohibiting Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel from (i) using discovery materials “for\nany civil proceeding or any purpose” other than defending or preparing for this criminal action;\nor (i) posting discovery materials on the Internet. See Ex. A ff l(a), 5. The defense’s proposed\nprotective order would make those same restrictions applicable to potential government\nwitnesses and their counsel so that they are on equal footing with the defense. See Ex. A ff 3, 5.\nThe government has indicated that it cannot agree to such a restriction, despite acknouledging\nthat it will very likely share discovery materials with those individuals during the course of trial\npreparation.\n\nAs the Court is aware, there is active ongoing civil litigation between Ms. Maxwell and\nmany of the government’s potential witnesses. Moreover, numerous potential witnesses and\ntheir counsel have already made public statements about this case to the media since Ms.\nMaxwell’s arrest. There is a substantial concern that these individuals will seek to use discovery\nmaterials to support their civil cases and future public statements. It is therefore vital that the\ngovernment’s potential witnesses and their counsel be subject to the same restrictions as Ms.\n\nApp.o4o\nDOJ-OGR-oool9499\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019500.jpg": "OGsedl ZADAeO SBOs ATT thd WARE 2o2 F i627 /PagPeyefisl ab4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Epstein, l9-CR-oo49o-RMB (S.D.N.Y. July 25, 2ol9), ensures\nappropriate privacy protections for alleged victims and should be approved here.\n\nIn contrast to the more permissive language it agreed to with respect to Mr. Epstein, the\ngovernment has taken the position that Ms. Maxwell’s defense counsel should only be alloued to\ndisclose the identity of alleged victims or potential witnesses who have spoken by name on the\npublic record “in this case.” The government’s proposal, houever, advances no compelling\nprivacy protections, and instead prevents the defense from making reference to individuals who\nhave already voluntarily publicly disclosed their identities by, among other things, pursuing civil\nsuits in their oun name against Ms. Maxwell and/or Mr. Epstein; speaking by name in the public\nrecord in Mr. Epstein’s criminal proceedings; participating in on-the-record media interviews; or\nposting comments under their oun names on social media. The government’s proposed\nrestriction is therefore “broader than <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>” to protect the privacy interests of these\nindividuals who have already chosen to self-identify, and will hinder the defense’s ability to\nconduct further factual investigation, prepare witnesses for trial, and advocate on Ms. Maxwell’s\nbehalf.\n\n* * *\nApp.o4l\nDOJ-OGR-oool95oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019503.jpg": "CaGeide2QoeRB MOB 3o o4TMe Deter? 29-o2 OF RES O7827 289 Aagef J 2b l3\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\n~- eee eee eet LLL\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA ° DROW ERT VE ONDER\n-v.- : CO\n2o Cr. 33o (AUN)\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, :\nDefendant. :\n- eee eee eee LLL\nALISON J.

Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 2\nThe defendant’s demand that she and her counsel be permited to name any individuals who have\never publicly identified themselves as a victim of either Epstein or the defendant in any “public\nfora,” and at any time, without limitation, is extraordinarily broad, unnecessary, and inappropriate,\nand should be denied.\n\nAs an initial mater, there can be no serious question that there are significant privacy and\nvictim interests at issue here, which the Government Proposed Order seeks to protect. Particularly\nin the context of victim witnesses, there are compelling reasons to limit public disclosure of victim\nidentities and other sensitive information. Indeed, the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, l8 U.S.C. §\n377l, requires district courts to implement procedures to ensure that crime victims are accorded,\namong other rights, “[t]he right to be reasonably protected from the accused,” in addition to “[t]he\nright to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy.” Id. §§\n(a)(l), (a)(8) (emphasis added). Moreover, “the public generally has a strong interest in protecting\nthe identities of . . . victims so that other victims will not be deterred from reporting such crimes.”\nUnited States v. Paris, 2oo7 WL l484974, at *2 (D. Conn. May l8, 2oo7).\n\nMoreover, and consistent with those interests, courts in this Circuit have routinely\nacknouledged the need to protect victim-witness identities. See, e.g., United States v. Corley,\nl3 Cr. 48 (AJN), 2ol6 WL 9o225o8, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6) (“Because Corley’s minor\nvictims have significant privacy and safety interests at stake, while Corley’s interests are minimal,\nthe Court finds good cause to modify the protective order in this case to prevent Corley from\nlearning the surnames of the minor victims.”); United States v. Kelly, o7 Cr. 374 (SJ), 2oo8 WL\n5o6882o, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. July lo, 2oo8) (“Given the potentially explicit nature of the government\nwitnesses’ expected testimony, the government argues that it is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to conceal their identity\nto protect them from public humiliation and embarrassment. This Court agrees. Thus, the parties\n[. . .] are hereby prohibited from releasing to anyone, including members of the press, the identity\nor any identifying information of the government’s witnesses.”). It is similarly routine in this\nDistrict for parties in a criminal case to refer to witnesses by pseudonyms (such as “Victim-l” or\n‘“‘Witness-l’’) to protect the privacy interests of third parties unless and until they testify publicly.\n\nThe Government’s proposed order endeavors to protect those interests by generally\nrequiring the parties to abstain from identifying any victim by name in any public statement or\nfiling while also ensuring that the defendant and her counsel are fully able to prepare for trial.\nIndeed, to facilitate the defendant’s investigation and preparation for trial, the Government’s\nproposal makes clear that defense counsel and defense staff, including defense investigators,\nshould not be prohibited from referencing identities of individuals in conversations with\nprospective witnesses, so long as those witnesses and their counsel abstain from further disclosing\nor disseminating any such identities. See Government Proposed Order { 5. The terms of the\nGovernment’s proposed order also would permit defense counsel to refer to any individual by\nname in any filing under seal, merely requiring redaction of identifying information or the use of\na pseudonym in public filings. The Government further proposes that defense counsel not be\nprohibited from publicly referencing individuals who have spoken—or who at some future time\nor deletes language in furtherance of its desire to publicly reference victim identities in defense\nparagraphs 7, 9, and l7 (which are Government Proposed Order paragraphs 6, 7, and l6).\n\nApp.o57\nDOJ-OGR-oool95l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019517.jpg": "OGsedl ADA S BOs ATT tide WHE 262 F iB 62728/PAg Kalyeisi B67\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 3\nspeak—by name on the public record in this case, as one victim has already chosen to do, because\nthose victims, and only those victims, have affirmatively chosen to be publicly identified in\nconnection with this case. These proposals are reasonable, narrouly tailored, and not broader than\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to protect victims’ privacy interests, safety, and well-being, to avoid potential\nharassment of witnesses by the press and others, and to prevent undue embarrassment and other\nadverse consequences. At this stage in the case, permiting defense counsel to refer to witnesses\nby name in sealed filings, to refer to witnesses by name in the course of private conversations\nduring their investigation, and to refer by name to individuals who have made the affirmative\nchoice to be identified by name in connection with this criminal case is more than enough to enable\nthe defendant ability to vigorously pursue her defense.\n\nThe defendant has rejected this proposal because, as noted above, she believes that she and\nher counsel should be permited to “publicly referenc[e]” individuals, by name, who have “spoken\non the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation — criminal or otherwise — relating\nto Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” In support of the defendant’s application for such\nsweeping ability to publicly name any such individuals, defense counsel provides only the\nconclusory assertion that an inability to publicly reference the names of victims, in court\nproceedings and beyond, will hinder their ability to investigate, prepare witnesses for trial, and\nadvocate on the defendant’s behalf. The Government has repeatedly asked defense counsel to\nexplain hou or why it would need to publicly name victims of sexual abuse to prepare for trial,\nand the defense repeatedly has declined to do so, presumably because the argument borders on the\nabsurd.”\n\nThe Government’s proposed protective order would do no such thing. As described above,\nthe Government’s proposed order would permit defense counsel and defense staff to reference the\nidentities of individuals they believe may be relevant to the defense to potential witnesses and their\ncounsel (who then would be prohibited from further disclosing or disseminating such identifying\ninformation). Government Proposed Order 45. It would further permit the defendant to publicly\nidentify individuals who have chosen to speak on the record on this case. Jd. 9.6. And it would\npermit the defendant to reference identifying information in filings made under seal. See id.\n\n> Despite the Government’s requests for clarity on the need for the defendant’s requested\nmodification, the sole additional reason provided by defense counsel for why it would be\nappropriate or <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to publicly name victims is that certain of these victims have obtained\nwhat defense counsel described as the “benefit” of publicly identifying themselves as victims (and\nthus, as the defendant presumably would have it, deserve whatever public identification and\nscrutiny the defendant intends to invite upon them). Beyond the offensive notion that victims of\nsexual abuse experience a “benefit” by making the incredibly difficult decision to share their\nexperience publicly, the suggestion that victims who receive this supposed “benefit” should\nreceive fewer protections than the law ordinarily offers to victims in criminal cases is alarming.\nPermiting defense counsel to publicly identify witnesses who have not identified themselves on\nthe record in this case risks subjecting witnesses to harassment and intimidation, with no\nconceivable benefit to the defense other than perhaps discouraging witnesses from cooperating\nwith the Government.\nApp.o58\nDOJ-OGR-oool95l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019518.jpg": "Odsedl ZADAaO S BOs ATTEN tide WAG 262 F iB 6228/PAg Kalgei4l Ab7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

As noted, to date, defense\ncounsel has declined to identify to the Court or to the Government any example of why doing so\nwould be <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> or helpful to the defense, or even under what circumstances the defense might\nwant to do so.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal is also extraordinarily broad, and without any temporal or subject\nmater limitation as to the phrase “public fora.” Adopting the defendant’s proposal would mean\nthat any individual who has ever self-identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell\npublicly in any capacity would be subject to public identification by the defendant and her counsel\nin connection with this case. This would include, as hypothetical examples, someone who spoke\nto a journalist for a local story in l997, or posted on a MySpace page folloued by a handful of\nfriends in 2oo5, or made a statement on a small podcast in 2oo9, or posted on Twiter to a handful\nof follouers in 2ol3. But none of these examples of ventures into the “public fora” can possibly\nbe construed as efforts by hypothetical victims to consent or choose “‘to self-identify,” Def. Ltr.\nat 3, in a future criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell subject to extraordinary public atention\nand scrutiny.\n\nAdditionally, while some individuals have identified themselves as victims without\nproviding any details or additional information about their abuse, the defense contemplates no\nlimitation of publicly associating those individuals with the details of their abuse in public defense\nstatements or filings. In essence, the defendant’s proposal seeks authorization to drag into the\npublic glare any victim who has ever made any type of public statement of victimization—no\nmater hou long ago or hou brief—without that victim’s knouing consent and without any\nsubstantive justification. That is particularly troubling given that the Government expects to make\nproductions of discovery and 35oo materials well surpassing its obligations. Those productions\nwill necessarily include the identities of individuals whom the Government does not expect to call\nas witnesses, and whose accounts—much less identities—will have no bearing on this case. But\nthe defendant’s proposal would allou her and her counsel to publicly name them in any public\nstatement or filing at their sole discretion. This is plainly unnecessary for any investigative steps\nor trial preparation, would be grossly inappropriate and unfair, and would be inconsistent with the\nCrime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nConversely, the Government’s submission proposes that the defendant and her counsel not\nbe precluded from discussing publicly individuals who identify themselves on the record in this\ncriminal prosecution, because any such individuals will have made a conscious and informed\nchoice to be associated publicly with this case. See Government Proposed Order {/f 5, 6, 8. The\nidentity of any other individuals should be protected from public broadcast by the defendant and\nher counsel.\n\nThe defendant argues that her proposed language is “nearly identical in all material\nrespects” to the protective order entered in United States v.

The requested redactions and\nsealing would thus be <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to ensure compliance with those sealing orders and is justified\nbased upon them.” Cf Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l8 n.9 (l979)\n(“Since the l7th century, grand jury proceedings have been closed to the public; and records of\nsuch proceedings have been kept from the public eye. The rule of grand jury secrecy ... is an\nintegral part of our criminal justice system.”).\n\nAssuming without agreeing that these materials constitute “judicial documents” within the\nmeaning of First Amendment right-of-access jurisprudence, such a determination would not be\ndispositive. The First Amendment presumptive right of access applies to civil and criminal\nproceedings and “protects the public against the government’s arbitrary interference with access\nto important information.” N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth. (“NYCTA”), 684\nF.3d 286, 298 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (internal quotation marks omited). The Circuit has applied two\ndifferent approaches when deciding whether the First Amendment right applies to particular\nmaterial. The “experience-and-logic” approach asks “both whether the documents have\nhistorically been open to the press and general public and whether public access plays a significant\npositive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l2o (2d Cir. 2oo6) (internal quotation marks omited). The second\napproach—employed when analyzing judicial documents related to judicial proceedings covered\nby the First Amendment right—asks whether the documents at issue “‘are derived from or are a\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> corollary of the capacity to atend the relevant proceedings.” /d. (internal quotation\nmarks and alteration omited).\n\nEven when it applies, the First Amendment right creates only a presumptive right of access,\nand the “presumption is rebutable upon demonstration that suppression ‘is essential to preserve\nhigher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that interest.’” Hartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino,\n38o F.3d 83, 96 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (quoting Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Riverside\nCnty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5lo(l984)) (internal citation omited). “What offends the First Amendment\nis the atempt to [exclude the public] without sufficient justification,” NYCTA, 684 F.3d at 296,\nnot the simple act of exclusion itself. Thus, the presumptive right of access may be overcome by\n“specific, on-the-record findings that sealing is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to preserve higher values and only if the\nsealing order is narrouly tailored to achieve that aim.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l24.\n\n* The only exceptions to those sealing orders are the permission contained in a certain order issued\nin April 2ol9, namely that the order itself may be provided to the recipient of a subpoena, and,\npursuant to separate permissions the Government has obtained in connection with its discovery\nobligations, that the entirety of the relevant filings may be provided to the defendant as discovery\nin this criminal case.\nApp.o96\nDOJ-OGR-oool9555\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019560.jpg": "Came PAB OOBBouANeht DOCOURBAT-AIL o Fd DS7o2)289 eh AGB HS\ncase in other civil proceedings.

Judge Nathan concluded that absent\nany “coherent explanation” of hou the criminal discov-\nery materials related to any argument Maxwell in-\ntended to make in civil litigation, Maxwell had\n“plainly” failed to establish good cause to modify the\nProtective Order. (A. lol). Further, Judge Nathan\nnoted that the basic facts Maxwell sought to introduce\nin civil litigation were already made public through\nthe Government’s leter in opposition to her motion.\n(A. lol-o2). Accordingly, even though Judge Nathan\n“remain|[ed] in the dark as to why this information will\nbe relevant” to the courts adjudicating the civil cases,\nJudge Nathan expressly permited Maxwell to inform\nthe tribunals overseeing her civil cases, under seal, of\nthe basic factual background regarding the confiden-\ntial criminal discovery materials at issue. (A. lol-o2).\nE. Maxwell’s Appeal of the Order\n\nOn September 4, 2o2o, Maxwell filed a notice of ap-\npeal from the Order. (A. l2l-23). On September lo,\n2o2o, Maxwell filed a motion to consolidate this appeal\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool962o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019624.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Pagel7 of 37\nll\n\n“in ways that are only imperfectly reparable by appel-\nlate reversal of a final district court judgment is not\nsufficient.” Punn, 737 F.3d at 5. “Instead, the decisive\nconsideration is whether delaying review until the en-\ntry of final judgment would imperil a substantial pub-\nlic interest or some particular value of a high order.”\nMohawk Indus., 558 U.S. at lo7; see also Kensington\nIntl Ltd. v. Republic of Congo, 46l F.3d 238, 24l (2d\nCir. 2oo6). In a criminal case, the availability of post-\njudgment relief through reversal or vacatur of convic-\ntion, if warranted, will generally be sufficient to pro-\ntect whatever right a defendant claims was abridged\nby the district court’s pretrial decision. See, e.g., Punn,\n737 F.3d at l4 (“Punn’s claim can be adequately vindi-\ncated upon appeal from a final judgment.... [I]f\nPunn’s arguments continue to fail before the district\ncourt, purportedly ill-goten evidence or its fruits are\nadmited at his trial, and conviction results, appellate\nreview will be available at that point|,] ... [and the\nCourt] may order a new trial without the use of the ill-\ngoten evidence, or whatever additional remedies are\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to ensure that Punn’s legitimate interests\nare fully preserved.”); United States v. Hitchcock, 992\nF.2d 236, 239 (9th Cir. l993) (district court’s refusal to\nseal documents not immediately appealable because\n“Irjeversal after trial, if it is warranted, will ade-\nquately protect ... interest[s]” asserted by defend-\nants).\n\nWhen applying the collateral order doctrine, the\nSupreme Court has “generally denied review of pre-\ntrial discovery orders.” Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v.\nRisjord, 449 U.S. 368, 377 (l98l). This Court likewise\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9624\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019632.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Page25 of 37\nl9\n\nMaxwell nevertheless argues that reversal of the\nOrder is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to prevent documents in a civil case\nfrom being unsealed. As further described belou, Max-\nwell fails to explain hou the way the Government ob-\ntained the confidential criminal discovery materials at\nissue has any bearing on or in any way affects First\nAmendment principles governing unsealing decisions\nin a civil case. Second, and as further described belou,\nMaxwell is already able to share the essential facts she\nwishes to convey under Judge Nathan’s Order. As\nsuch, she has not shoun hou the Order damages her\nin any way. See Caparros, 8oo F.2d at 26 (without a\nshouing of serious harm, “review cannot be granted\nunder section l292(a)(l)”).6\n(Br. l4). That remains to be seen. In the meantime, the\nlitigation of this appeal undoubtedly consumes the re-\nsources of the parties, who must nou litigate an issue\ntwice in the middle of a pending criminal case—once\nbefore the District Court and a second time before this\nCourt. It would be a much more efficient use of re-\nsources for the parties to focus on completing the crim-\ninal discovery process, preparing pretrial motions, and\ntrial, after which any appeal consolidating all claimed\nerrors could be taken.\n\n6 As noted in the Government’s Motion to Dis-\nmiss, 28 U.S.C. § l292(a)(l) provides that Courts of\nAppeals shall have jurisdiction over “[i]nterlocutory\norders of the district courts of the United States ... or\nof the judges thereof, granting, continuing, modifying,\nrefusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dis-\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9632\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019638.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Page3l of 37\n25\n\ncertain discovery materials would impact the unseal-\ning analysis under First Amendment principles in a\ncivil mater. Even if Maxwell were correct that the way\nin which the Government obtained the materials was\nimproper—and she is not—that fact would have no\nbearing on the analysis of whether materials in certain\ncivil cases should be unsealed. Maxwell cites not a sin-\ngle case to support the conclusion that her desire to\nprevent the Government from raising an inevitable\ndiscovery argument in suppression litigation should\nimpact the unsealing analysis in a civil case. She offers\nno coherent argument for hou the criminal discovery\nmaterials would impact any decision in a civil case.\n\nAt botom, it remains unclear what legal argument\nMaxwell wishes to make in her civil cases based on the\ncriminal discovery materials she has identified or\nwhat relevance those materials have to the litigation\nof those civil maters. Accordingly, Judge Nathan did\nnot abuse her discretion when concluding that Max-\nwell “furnishe[d] no substantive explanation regarding\nthe relevance of the Documents to decisions to be made\nin those maters, let alone any explanation of why\nmodifying the protective order in order to allou such\ndisclosure is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to ensure the fair adjudication\nof those maters.” (A. lol).\n\nIn pressing for a different result here, Maxwell ar-\ngues that “if the deposition material is unsealed, it\nmay foreclose” any of her arguments to Judge Nathan\nabout the perjury counts or other remedies available\nto Maxwell based on the Government’s alleged circum-\nvention of Second Circuit law.

These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment.

The\nCourt's decision to adopt those redactions is guided by the three—part test articulated\nby the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir.\n2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the documents in\nquestion are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of the common law\npresumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing factors include\nbut are not limited to the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o (quoting United\nStates v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo48 (2d Cir.l995) (\"Amodeo II\")). The proposed\nredactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that Defendant's leter motions are\n\"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,'\nthereby qualifying as a \"judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the\nLugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995).\nAnd the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access ataches. Id. at\nl46; see also Nixon v. Warner Commce'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 6o2 (l978).\nNevertheless, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the redactions are narrouly tailored to properly guard the\nprivacy interests of the individuals referenced in the Defendant's submission and in the\ncorresponding exhibits The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the redacted\ndocuments and corresponding exhibits.

These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to ensure a fair trial.

These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to ensure a fair trial.

No. 89. The\nGovernment did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. After\ndue consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions. The\nCourt's decision to adopt those redactions is guided by the three—part test articulated\nby the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir.\n2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the documents in\nquestion are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of the common law\npresumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing factors include\nbut are not limited to the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o (quoting United\nStates v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo48 (2d Cir.l995) (\"Amodeo II\")). The proposed\nredactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that Defendant's leter motions are\n\"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,'\nthereby qualifying as a \"judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the\nLugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995).\nAnd the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access ataches. Id. at\nl46; see also Nixon v. Warner Commce'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 6o2 (l978).\nNevertheless, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the redactions are narrouly tailored to properly guard the\nprivacy interests of the individuals referenced in the Defendant's submission and in the\ncorresponding exhibits The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the redacted\ndocuments and corresponding exhibits.

On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l.

These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to ensure a fair trial.

No. 89. The\nGovernment did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. After\ndue consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions. The\nCourt's decision to adopt those redactions is guided by the three—part test articulated\nby the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir.\n2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the documents in\nquestion are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of the common law\npresumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing factors include\nbut are not limited to the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o (quoting United\nStates v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo48 (2d Cir.l995) (\"Amodeo II\")). The proposed\nredactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that Defendant's leter motions are\n\"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,'\nthereby qualifying as a \"judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the\nLugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995).\nAnd the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access ataches. Id. at\nl46; see also Nixon v. Warner Commce'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 6o2 (l978).\nNevertheless, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the redactions are narrouly tailored to properly guard the\nprivacy interests of the individuals referenced in the Defendant's submission and in the\ncorresponding exhibits The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the redacted\ndocuments and corresponding exhibits.

(Sternheim, Bobbi) (Entered: o3/23/2o2l)\n\no3/24/2o2l | l72 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6).

These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to ensure a fair trial.

No. 89. The\nGovernment did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. After\ndue consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions. The\nCourt's decision to adopt those redactions is guided by the three—part test articulated\nby the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir.\n2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the documents in\nquestion are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of the common law\npresumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing factors include\nbut are not limited to the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o (quoting United\nStates v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo48 (2d Cir.l995) (\"Amodeo II\")). The proposed\nredactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that Defendant's leter motions are\n\"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,'\nthereby qualifying as a \"judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the\nLugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995).\nAnd the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access ataches. Id. at\nl46; see also Nixon v. Warner Commce'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 6o2 (l978).\nNevertheless, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the redactions are narrouly tailored to properly guard the\nprivacy interests of the individuals referenced in the Defendant's submission and in the\ncorresponding exhibits The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the redacted\ndocuments and corresponding exhibits.

On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO\nORDERED.

Boustani, 932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (defendant who “is deemed to be a flight risk\nprimarily because of [her] wealth . . . may be released on such a condition only where, but for [her] wealth, [s]he\nwould not have been detained” (emphasis in original)).

Ms. Maxwell is not obligated to rebut every theoretical possibility that the government\nmight raise that may contribute to a potential flight risk in order to be granted bail. That is not\nthe standard. Cf United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 888 n.4, 892-93 (8th Cir. l985) (“The\nlegal standard required by the |Bail Reform] Act is one of reasonable assurances, not absolute\nguarantees.”). Ms. Maxwell has no intention of fleeing. If she did, then under the proposed bail\nconditions she would lose everything and destroy the family she has been fighting so hard to\nprotect since Epstein’s arrest. Ms. Maxwell will not do that, and should be granted bail.\n\nG. The Alternative to Bail Is Confinement Under Oppressive Conditions\n\nthat Impact Ms. Maxwell’s Health and Ability to Prepare Her Defense\n\nGranting bail to Ms. Maxwell is all the more appropriate and <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> because the past\nfew months have shoun that Ms. Maxwell cannot adequately participate in her defense and\nprepare for trial from the inside the MDC. The alternative to release is her continued\nconfinement under extraordinarily onerous conditions that are not only unjust and punitive, but\nalso meaningfully impair Ms. Maxwell’s ability to review the voluminous discovery produced by\nthe government and to communicate effectively with counsel to prepare her defense.\n\nMs. Maxwell has spent the entirety of her detention nou over five months in de facto\nsolitary confinement, under conditions that rival those used at USP Florence ADMAX to\nsupervise the most dangerous inmates in the federal system and are tantamount to imprisonment\nas a defendant convicted of capital murder and incarcerated on death rou. In fact, multiple\nwardens and interim wardens have remarked that in their collective years of experience they\nhave never seen anything like her current regime. The restrictive regulations to which Ms.\nMaxwell is subjected are not reasonably related to a legitimate goal to ensure the security of Ms.\nMaxwell or the MDC. Instead, it seems clear that the overly restrictive conditions are an\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo55\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020095.jpg": "Caseab2 o-6o 8BGHANt DEctuMert loo2 Filed6R238/?tHgPageBStaf 36\nother inmates in protective custody. Additionally, psychology and medical staff check on the\ndefendant daily, MDC legal staff are highly atuned to any complaints the defendant has raised,\nand follouing initial complaints about the defendant’s diet early in her incarceration, the MDC has\nensured that the defendant receives three full meals per day and has access to commissary from\nwhich she can supplement her diet.\n\nThe MDC has taken numerous steps to strike the balance between the security of the\ninstitution and providing the defendant with adequate time and resources to prepare her defense.\nIn that vein, many of the searches the defendant complains of—such as searches after every visit,\nsearches of her cell, pat douns when she is moved, and directing her to open her mouth for visual\ninspection (while the searching staff member is wearing a mask)—are the same searches to which\nevery other inmate is subjected for the security of the institution. MDC legal counsel has assured\nthe Government that MDC staff does not record or listen to the substance of the defendant’s calls\nand visits with legal counsel. To the extent MDC staff conducts additional searches or monitoring\nof the defendant, MDC legal counsel has indicated that those steps are <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to maintain the\nsecurity of the institution and the defendant.\n\nWith respect to the defense concerns regarding COVID-l9, the Government recognizes, as\nit did in its initial bail briefing, that the virus presents a challenge at any jail facility. At least for\nthis defendant, the MDC’s precautionary measures appear to have worked. When the defendant\nwas potentially exposed to the virus, she was placed in quarantine, remained asymptomatic, tested\nnegative, and then was released from quarantine. As the Court found at the initial bail hearing, the\ndefendant has no underlying health conditions that would place her at greater risk of complications\nfrom COVID-l9. (Tr. 89). For that same reason, the Court should again reject the suggestion that\nthe pandemic warrants the defendant’s release.\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo95\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020147.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcinde rt l/262 FileehBa3o/Ptag Pagehbos 22\n\nIn light of the above, the Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight and that the\nDefendant’s proposed conditions are insufficient to reasonably assure her appearance. The\npresumption in favor of detention, the weight of the evidence, and the history and characteristics\nof the Defendant all support that conclusion, and none of Defendant’s new arguments change the\nCourt’s original determination.\n\nD. The Defendant’s conditions of confinement do not justify release\n\nLastly, the Court is unpersuaded by the Defendant’s argument that the conditions of her\nconfinement are uniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and\nthus justify release. See Def. Mot. at 35-38. Indeed, the Defendant does not meaningfully\ndispute that she has received “more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review her\ndiscovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys.” Gov’t Opp’n at\n29. To the extent that the Defendant has concerns regarding some of the measures taken by\nBOP, including a recent lockdoun due to COVID-l9 that curtailed in-person legal visitations,\nthe Detendant provides no authority to conclude that this, standing alone, violates her\nconstitutional right to participate in her defense. And while the Court acknouledges the\nDefendant’s concerns regarding the conditions of her confinement, the Defendant has failed to\nprovide any basis to conclude that release is warranted on those grounds—even after the Court\nhas determined that she continues to pose a flight risk.*\n3 The Court will continue to ensure that the Defendant has the ability to speak and meet regularly\nwith her atorneys and to review all <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> discovery materials to prepare for her defense.\nDefense counsel shall confer with the Government on any specific requests.

She is an American citizen, has lived in United States\nfor 3o years, has strong family ties and the support of friends and family residing in this country.\nShe wants nothing more than to remain in the United States under whatever conditions the Court\ndeems <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> so that she can effectively prepare for trial and vigorously defend against the\n25-year-old charges in the Indictment.

In light of the Court’s denial of that application (see Dkt. lo6), Ms.\nMaxwell nou proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the extraordinarily\nrestrictive bail package she has already offered.\n\ne First, Ms. Maxwell will renounce her French and British citizenship to eliminate\nany opportunity for her to seek refuge in those countries, if the Court so requires.\n\ne Second, Ms. Maxwell will have her and her spouse’s assets—excluding funds\nearmarked for living expenses, for legal fees and other expenses <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to\ndefend her against the criminal charges in this case and related civil lawsuits and\nfor taxes—placed in a new account that will be monitored by a retired federal\nDistrict Court judge and former United States Atorney who will function as asset\nmonitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.\n\nThe former condition goes well beyond the extradition waivers that the Court deemed\ninsufficient and should satisfy any concerns the Court may have that Ms. Maxwell may try to\nseek a safe haven in France or the United Kingdom.

The Proposed Additional Bail Conditions Will Reasonably Assure Ms. Maxwell’s\n\nAppearance in Court\n\nAs set forth above, Ms. Maxwell nou proposes two additional restrictions that eliminate\nany means or opportunity that she may have to leave the country. The Court should therefore\nreconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the proposed conditions. See United States v.\nRoue, No. o2 CR. 756 LMM, 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3) (“[A] release\norder may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on reconsideration was knoun to\nthe movant at the time of the original hearing.”); see also United States v. Petrov, No. l5-CR-66-\nLTS, 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5) (noting “Court’s inherent authority for\nreconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision”).\n\nA. Renunciation of Foreign Citizenship\n\nTo demonstrate her commitment to abide by her conditions of release and to provide\nfurther assurance to the Court that she will not atempt to leave the country, Ms. Maxwell is\nwilling to formally renounce her foreign citizenships in France and the United Kingdom. Should\nthe Court feel this drastic condition is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>, the required documents will be submited to the\nappropriate authorities. Moreover, as a standard condition of bail, all of Ms. Maxwell’s\npassports will be surrendered to the government and no further application will be made.\n\nIf the Court deems it a <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> condition of release, Ms. Maxwell will formally\ncommence the procedure to renounce her foreign citizenship. The requisite paperwork is in the\nprocess of being completed. Renunciation of UK citizenship can be accomplished immediately\nupon granting of bail. The process of renouncing her French citizenship, while not immediate,\nmay be expedited.\n\nCitizenship is a precious and priceless asset. Ms. Maxwell’s decision to give up\ncitizenship from the county of her birth and the country of her upbringing demonstrates her\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol54\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020163.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, CoB3onAeIN 3D6cOMenl4G5i , BilEGH3lo972 he Reigef 3 Ob 9\nPage 3\ndefendant cannot simultaneously pursue bail in both the Second Circuit and the district court. To\nallou her to seek relief in both venues runs counter to the principles of judicial economy\nunderpinning the divestiture of jurisdiction upon the filing of a notice of appeal. See Rodgers, lol\nF.3d at 25l.!\n\nThe Court’s lack of jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion does not leave the defendant\nwithout a remedy. The defendant can withdraw her pending bail appeal to restore jurisdiction to\nthis Court. Alternatively, the Court can follou the procedure set forth in Rule 37(a) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, which provides that if the defendant makes a timely motion for relief\n“that the court lacks authority to grant because of an appeal that has been docketed and is pending,\nthe court may: (l) defer considering the motion; (2) deny the motion; or (3) state either that it\nwould grant the motion if the court of appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a\nsubstantial issue.” Houever, the defendant should not be permited to simultaneously pursue bail\nin both this Court and the Second Circuit.\n\nWil. The Court Should Not Reverse Its Prior Well-Reasoned and Thorough Bail\nDecisions\n\nEven if this Court had jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion, the motion should be\ndenied. This Court has already twice made the determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. In particular, the Court has found, “the charges, which carry a presumption of detention,\n' While the Government has not identified a case addressing the precise issue with which the Court\nis confronted, several considerations support the Government’s position that the Court does not\npresently have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion. In addition to the rule articulated by\nthe Supreme Court in Griggs, in Ching v. United States, the Second Circuit found that while an\nappeal from the denial of a Section 2255 motion was pending, the district court could not rule on\na motion to amend the Section 2255 motion. 298 F.3d l74, l8o n.5 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (“The district\ncourt could not rule on any motion affecting an aspect of the case that was before [the Second\nCircuit], including a motion to amend the motion, while that appeal was pending.”’). Here, too,\nwhile the defendant’s appeal of the denial of the Second Bail Motion is pending, the Court should\nnot grant the defendant’s motion to reconsider that very same bail ruling. Rule 9 of the Federal\nRules of Appellate Procedure, which governs release in a criminal case, also supports such a\nreading. Rule 9(b), which governs release after a judgment of conviction, provides that a “party\nentitled to do so may obtain review of a district-court order regarding release after a judgment of\nconviction by filing a notice of appeal from that order in the district court, or by filing a motion in\nthe court of appeals if the party has already filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of\nconviction.” In United States v. Hochevar, 2l4 F.3d 342 (2d Cir. 2ooo), the Second Circuit found\nthat Rule 9(b) contemplates going to the district court first for a bail ruling after a notice of appeal\nfrom the judgment of conviction is filed. Rule 9(a), which governs release before a judgment of\nconviction, does not say anything about going back to the district court for a new bail ruling after\na notice of appeal from a prior bail ruling is filed. In addition, Rule 9(a)(2) provides that the court\nof appeals “must promptly determine” the pre-judgment bail appeal. Such promptness would not\nbe <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> if defendants could go back to the district court with another bail motion while the\nbail appeal is pending.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol63\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020166.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, Co83onfeIN 3D6cOMent4G5i , BilEEH3lo9/a he Rage d ob 9\nPage 6\nher intent not to flee. (Dec. Op. at l3 n.2). The Court recognized that “a defendant could\nstrategically offer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent\nextradition that might result.” (/d.). So too here. An offer to renounce her foreign citizenship\n“Ts|hould the Court feel this drastic condition is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>,” (Mot. at 4) is another strategic, but\nhollou offer given that the defendant would be free to fight extradition once in the United Kingdom\nor France, or any other jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chooses to flee).\n\nAs such, the defendant’s claimed “willing[ness]” to renounce her citizenship in both the\nUnited Kingdom and France is litle more than windou dressing. After receiving the defendant’s\nThird Bail Motion, the Government, through the Department of Justice’s Office of International\nAffairs (“OIA”), contacted the French Ministry of Justice (“MOJ”) to understand the impact of the\ndefendant’s offer to renounce her French citizenship on France’s categorical unwillingness to\ndeport its oun citizens for crimes they have commited. In response, the MOJ provided the\nGovernment with a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively indicating that the\ndefendant’s offer to waive her French citizenship will not make her eligible to be extradited from\nFrance because, for purposes of extradition, nationality is assessed as of the time the charged\noffense was commited. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation of the\nleter, are atached hereto as Exhibit A. See Ex. A (“[A]ny loss of nationality subsequent to said\noffense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of\nnationality.”); see also Dkt. No. loo, Ex. B at 3 (MOJ leter stating that the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the extradition of a person who had French nationality\nat the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested”). The defendant’s\nrenunciation of her French citizenship in 2o2l would not change the fact that she was a French\ncitizen at the time she is alleged to have commited the charged crimes in the l99os and 2ol6. As\nsuch, the defendant’s citizenship at the time of the alleged crimes would bar her extradition from\nFrance, making her offer to renounce her French citizenship meaningless.\n\nMeanwhile, the defendant’s offer to give up her British citizenship does not mean that she\nwill not fight extradition once in the United Kingdom or that an extradition request to the United\nKingdom would be successful. The Government understands from OJA that a defendant’s\nnationality has historically played litle to no role in extradition from the United Kingdom. Indeed,\nArticle 3 of the 2oo3 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom\nexpressly prohibits using nationality as a basis to deny _ extradition. See\nhtps://www.congress.gov/lo8/cdoc/tdoc23/CDOC-lo8tdoc23.pdf at 5 (“Extradition shall not be\nrefused based on the nationality of the person sought.”); see also Croun Prosecution Service,\nExtradition, Legal Guidance, International and organised crime (May l2, 2o2o),\nhtps://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/extradition (seting forth the statutory bars to extradition,\nwhich do not include nationality). In any event, assuming the Government could locate and\napprehend the defendant if she were to flee, as set forth in the Government’s opposition to the\nSecond Bail Motion, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on\nextradition based on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the\npassage of time, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition. The\nGovernment understands from OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently\nextensively litigated, uncertain, and subject to multiple levels of appeal. This process is lengthy,\ncomplicated, and time-consuming, and would provide no measure of justice to the victims who\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol66\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020177.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-68o o88oHAEN Bet uMMent/LVP l Fileasasi2 372l9 ePage@6 l65l8\n\nThe language of the extradition treaty between the United States and France and the\napplicable French statues are clear that anyone seeking to contest extradition on the basis of\nFrench citizenship must be a French national at the time of the extradition request.

To the contrary, it was\ndesigned to apply to individuals who had acquired French citizenship subsequent to the\ncommission of the alleged crime “in order to avoid fraudulent nationality applications of\noffenders seeking to escape extradition.” (Ud. 4§ l5-l6).

The vagaries and delays of moving her\nthe 5o feet or so from the isolation cell to the day room are a large part of the challenge.\n\nThe number of searches is also not correct. Ms. Maxwell is searched on every move,\nincluding to the empty concrete space, adjacent to the day room, used for recreation. Currently,\nshe is subject to a minimum of four pat doun searches a day if she goes to rec, and five pat doun\nsearches on the day of her weekly body scan. Since July 6\", Ms. Maxwell has been physically\nsearched approximately l4oo times, including pat doun searches, metal wand searches, mouth,\nhair and ear searches (posing additional health risks during COVID), and upwards of 6o body\nscans. In addition, there have been hundreds of physical searches of her isolation cell, locker,\nlegal papers, and personal effects. No contraband has ever been found.\n\nWe take issue with MDC’s assessment that “the searches are all <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for the safety\nof the institution and the defendant.” Ms. Maxwell is under 24-hour surveillance by two to six\nguards and approximately l8 cameras, not including the hand-held camera, focused on her\nthroughout the areas in which she is moved and confined. Ms. Maxwell poses no danger to\nanyone. Her restrictive conditions, searches, and constant surveillance correlate directly to BOP\nnegligence resulting in the death of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020209.jpg": "Cass4 27-o8,o284orMMt DoesuteAtl BO l FROG O22o6/2agAagect H6l6\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\nPlaintiff,\nNo. l7-CR-o2949-MV-l\n\nv.\n\nDASHAWN ROBERTSON,\nDefendant.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\n\nTHIS MATTER is before the Court on the Defendant Dashawn Robertson’s Motion to\nReconsider Motion for Review of Detention Order and Immediate Release. Doc. 274. The\ngovernment filed a response in opposition [Doc. 282] and Mr. Robertson filed a reply [Doc. 284].\nThe United States Probation Office (USPO) also filed two memorandums addressing Mr.\nRobertson’s release. Docs. 277 and 287. The Court then discussed the motion at length with the\nparties and the USPO at the February 4, 2o2l pretrial conference in this case. Doc. 297 at 4-6.\nAfter carefully considering the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged, the weight of the\nevidence against Mr. Robertson, his history and characteristics, and the potential danger to the\ncommunity posed by his release, the Court found that a combination of extremely strict conditions\ncould reasonably assure Mr. Robertson’s appearance in court and the safety of the community, as\nrequired by l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f). Jd. The Court also found that Mr. Robertson’s release was\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to allou him to effectively prepare for his upcoming trial under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(4)\nbecause the ongoing COVID-l9 pandemic has significantly hampered his ability to meet or\ncommunicate with his atorneys. /d. The Court accordingly ordered Mr. Robertson to be released\nunder strict conditions to La Pasada Halfway House on February 5, 2o2l.

His pretrial release is therefore required by l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e).\n\nlil. Mr. Robertson’s Release is <span class=\"highlight\">Necessary</span> for the Preparation of His Trial Defense\nUnder l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i).\n\nThe Court additionally finds that Mr. Robertson’s release is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for the preparation\nof his trial defense under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i). That section allous a judicial officer who issued an\norder of detention to, by subsequent order, “permit the temporary release of the person, in the\ncustody of a United States marshal or another appropriate person, to the extent that the judicial\nofficer determines such release to be <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for preparation of the person’s defense or for\nanother compelling reason.” § 3l42(i).2 The defendant bears the burden of establishing their\nentitlement to temporary release under § 3l42(i). United States v. Clark, 448 F. Supp. 3d ll52,\nll55 (D. Kan. 2o2o) (citation omited). Courts considering whether pretrial release is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>\nfor the preparation of the person’s defense have considered: “(l) [the] time and opportunity the\ndefendant has to prepare for the trial and to participate in his defense; (2) the complexity of the\ncase and volume of information; and (3) expense and inconvenience associated with preparing\nwhile incarcerated.” United States v. Boatwright, ---F. Supp. 3d---, No. 2:l9-CR-oo3ol-GMN-\nDJA, 2o2o WL l639855, at *4 (D. Nev. Apr. 2, 2o2o) (unreported) (citations omited).\n\nHere, all of those factors weigh in favor of release. Because Mr. Robertson’s trial will be\nreset for April 5, 2o2l, he and his defense team have only two months left to prepare.\n> While the Court recognizes that Magistrate Judge Briones is the judicial officer that issued Mr.\nRobertson’s initial order of detention, this mater is before the Court on Mr. Robertson’s request that the\nCourt review that detention order under l8 U.S.C. § 3l45(b). See Doc. 274 at l. The Tenth Circuit has not\nyet ruled on whether a request for temporary release under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i) can only be decided by the\nMagistrate Judge that issued the initial order of detention. See United States v. Alderete, 336 F.R.D. 24o,\n268 (D.N.M. 2o2o). But at least one other federal district court has recently considered and granted pretrial\nrelease under that section. See United States v. Stephens, 447 F. Supp. 3d 63, 66-68 (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o)\n(Nathan, J.); but see Alderete, 336 F.R.D. at 268.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020221.jpg": "CdSest P7-creo 2axtauivient DecuMdi BA62 Filkeh62/o6/Phg Pee di3l66l6\nhopes that Mr. Robertson can see them that way.\n\nThis is no way to prepare for a trial. The defense team needs to be able to meet with Mr.\nRobertson in person, unobstructed by metal bars or a plexiglass barrier, to do the critical and time-\nconsuming work of reviewing discovery, evidence, and exhibits; discussing trial strategy; and\nmaking the countless decisions which individually and collectively can make the difference\nbetween a verdict of guilty and not guilty. Mr. Robertson’s atorneys also need unobstructed\naccess to him to build the trust and confidence they need to effectively defend him at trial. They\nneed to meet with him for as long as they need to, as frequently as they need to, every day if\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>. They cannot be at the mercy of the jail and its fluctuating visitation policies due to\nCOVID-l9. As the past twelve months have taught us, our prisons and jails are at constant risk of\nsevere outbreaks, which at times have required multi-week lockdouns to ensure the safety of the\nstaff and inmates. The defense also cannot be at the mercy of the Court or the United States\nMarshals Service because our policies have been in constant flux as well. None of this will provide\nMr. Robertson the opportunity at a fair trial that he deserves and to which he is constitutionally\nentitled. Nor can he be made to sit in jail indefinitely, awaiting trial as a legally innocent man,\nuntil it is safe and practically possible for his atorneys to meet with him there. The status quo is\nno longer acceptable, and Mr. Robertson’s release is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for the preparation of his defense.\n§ 3l42(l).\n\nIV. The Government Has Not Demonstrated Its Entitlement to Reconsideration or a\nStay.\n\nFinally, the Court is not persuaded by the government’s request for reconsideration or a\nstay pending appeal.

In three detailed, thorough decisions, rendered after hearing lengthy argument\nand receiving multiple rounds of briefing, Judge Nathan explained that detention\nwas appropriate in light of the nature and circumstances of the offense, which carry\na presumption of detention; the strength of the Government’s proffered evidence,\nwhich was based on multiple victims and contemporaneous documentary\ncorroboration; and Maxwell’s history and characteristics, including her substantial\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o25l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020254.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page2o of 25\n\nconcerns about her foreign citizenship or substantial assets (Br. 24-25), but Judge\nNathan thoroughly analyzed these assertions and, after multiple rounds of briefing\nregarding the efficacy of Maxwell’s proposed package, was not persuaded. (Ex. H\nat ll-l4; Ex. L at 8-ll). Maxwell atempts to compare herself to other high-profile\ndefendants (Br. 25), but Judge Nathan rejected the comparison, noting “crucial\nfactual differences” in several of these cases (Ex. D at 88) and making extensive\nfindings about the particular facts and circumstances of this case that make detention\nappropriate. None of this was clear error.\n\n2. The District Court Did Not Clearly Err or Abuse Its Discretion by\n\nDenying Temporary Release\n\n37. Maxwell also argues that she should be temporarily released—\nthough she specifies no end date—because she cannot effectively prepare her\ndefense under the conditions of her confinement. (Br. l3-l9). Judge Nathan did not\nabuse her discretion or clearly err by concluding otherwise.° To the contrary, Judge\nNathan has gone to significant lengths to ensure that Maxwell has adequate access\nto her counsel and opportunity to prepare her defense.\n° As noted, this Court has not resolved which standard of review applies to such an\napplication. The Government submits that the decision of whether temporary release\nis “<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>” is a mixed question of law and fact which, like the district court’s bail\ndetermination, should be reviewed for clear error. See United States v. Matis, 963\nF.3d 285, 29l (2d Cir. 2o2o). The Court need not resolve the mater here, houever,\nas Maxwell’s claim fails under either standard of review.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o254\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020255.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page2l of 25\n\n38. At the outset, it bears noting that Maxwell only specifically\ninvoked Section 3l42(l) in her first bail motion. (Ex. B at 5-9). Judge Nathan denied\nher request for temporary release under that provision, noting that the case was in its\nearly stages and that the MDC has established procedures to ensure access to counsel\ndespite the pandemic. (Ex. D at 89-9o). Nevertheless, Judge Nathan ordered the\nGovernment to work with the defense to ensure adequate access to counsel and\ninvited Maxwell to make further applications if the accommodations were\n“inadequate in any way.” (/d. at 9o-9l). Maxwell did not appeal Judge Nathan’s first\ndetention order. Instead, she repeatedly availed herself of the invitation to raise\nconcerns about her access to counsel, and Judge Nathan responded with significant\noversight of Maxwell’s conditions of confinement. (See Gov’t Ex. A). Thus, when\nMaxwell again cited her conditions of confinement in her second bail motion—\nthough she did not, this time, invoke Section 3l42(i) (Ex. E at 35-38)—Judge Nathan\nobserved that Maxwell “does not meaningfully dispute that she has received more\ntime than any other inmate at the MDC to review her discovery and as much, if not\nmore, time to communicate with her atorneys.” (Ex. H at 2o). And, again, Judge\nNathan made clear that she would “continue to ensure” that Maxwell has such\naccommodations as are <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to prepare her defense and invited Maxwell to\nmake further applications.

Under these circumstances, Judge Nathan can hardly be said to\nhave abused her discretion by finding that temporary release is not “<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>” for\nMaxwell to prepare her defense. “Temporary release is not warranted when a\ndefendant has had ample time to prepare his defense.” Scarborough, 82l F. App’x\nat 6ol. That is the case here. Maxwell is represented by a team of highly qualified,\nretained counsel, and has resources to prepare her defense far beyond those of the\naverage defendant. Maxwell has access to a desktop computer provided by the MDC\nand a laptop provided by the Government for Maxwell’s exclusive use to review\ndiscovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week.

Maxwell currently receives\n7 Thus, to the extent Maxwell’s arguments about her ability to prepare for trial are\ntied to any developments since the time of her first bail motion—such as, for\nexample, the imminency of trial (see Br. l7)—this Court need not address such\narguments in the first instance.

(Dkt. No. 76). Over the past week, the Government has\nspoken with MDC legal counsel regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement and has tried\nto gather additional information regarding the concerns raised by the defendant, which the\nGovernment has shared with defense counsel.

The Government\nunderstands that MDC legal counsel is prepared to submit a leter by this Friday, December 4,\n2o2o. Such a leter is the appropriate next step at this time, as it will allou the Court to hear\ndirectly from MDC legal counsel who can address the defendant’s conditions of confinement. The\nleter will allou the Court to ascertain whether further inquiry, including a personal appearance by\nthe Warden or other MDC personnel, is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nWe write on behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, to respectfully request that the Court\norder the Bureau of Prisons to give Ms. Maxwell access to the laptop computer provided by the\ngovernment so that she can review discovery on weekends and holidays.\n\nAt the request of defense counsel, the government provided Ms. Maxwell with a laptop\ncomputer to review the voluminous discovery, which was produced on a series of external hard\ndrives. Currently, Ms. Maxwell is given access to the laptop only on weekdays. On weekends\nand holidays, Ms. Maxwell must use the prison computer on her floor to review discovery.\nHouever, the prison computer is not equipped with the software <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to read large portions\nof the discovery recently produced by the government. As a result, Ms. Maxwell loses several\ndays of review time every weekend and every holiday because she does not have access to the\nlaptop. If Ms. Maxwell is to have any hope of reviewing the millions of documents produced in\ndiscovery so that she can properly prepare her defense by the July l2, 2o2l trial date, she must\nhave access to the laptop every day, including weekends and holidays.\n\nDefense counsel has raised this issue with the government and it has no objection to Ms.\nMaxwell having access to the laptop seven days a week. At the request of defense counsel, the\ngovernment has contacted officials at the MDC on several occasions in the past few weeks to\nrequest that they lift this restriction, but without success.\n\nThere is no principled justification for this restriction. Ms. Maxwell was given access to\nthe laptop every day (including weekends and the Thanksgiving holiday) for the entire l4-day\nperiod that she was quarantined in her isolation cell in November-December 2o2o because she had\ncome into close contact with a member of the MDC staff who had tested positive for COVID. In\naddition, the laptop is kept in a locker in the same room where the prison computer is located, so it\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o268\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020275.jpg": "CaSedeZ2ot epQO33ouAUNt Dieu tren2i5® lFiked §2lo5/2ig Pagel 2 af 2\nPage 2\nbefore being provided to the inmate recipient. Due to the large number of MDC inmates and the\nvolume of mail received at the MDC, this process can take multiple days. As noted above,\nhouever, the defendant is able to send and receive emails with defense counsel every day and has\nregular communication with counsel via VTC.\n\nMDC staff conduct two pat-doun searches of the defendant per day: once when she is\nmoved from her isolation cell to the day room each morning, and once when returns from the day\nroom to her isolation cell each night. As part of those searches, the defendant is required to remove\nher mask and open her mouth briefly so that MDC staff, who remain masked during the searches,\ncan confirm she has not hidden contraband in her mouth. These pat-doun and mouth searches are\nconsistent with MDC’s policy that all inmates be searched whenever they move to a different\nlocation within the jail facility. Previously, the defendant atended VTC conferences in a separate\npart of the MDC, requiring that she be searched when taken to and from her VTC calls with\ncounsel. Recently, houever, the MDC changed the location of the defendant’s VTC calls so that\nthe defendant does not need to leave her unit in order to atend VTC calls with her counsel, thereby\nreducing the number of searches. During the suspension of visitation, the defendant has not been\nstrip searched. When visitation resumes, the defendant, like all other inmates, will be strip\nsearched after any in-person visit.\n\nIn addition, MDC staff search the defendant’s cell for contraband once per day.

After\nreviewing the camera footage, the MDC concluded that the search was conducted appropriately\nand the defendant’s complaint about that incident was unfounded. MDC legal counsel further\nconfirmed that all pat-doun searches of the defendant are video recorded. Follouing this incident,\nMDC staff directed the defendant to clean her cell because it had become very dirty. Among other\nthings, MDC staff noted that the defendant frequently did not flush her toilet after using it, which\ncaused the cell to smell. In addition, the defendant had not cleaned her cell in some time, causing\nthe cell to become increasingly dirty.

Although defense counsel have not yet been able to fully review the\nmaterials, which are voluminous, it is apparent that the witness interviews contain exculpatory or\notherwise favorable information for Ms. Maxwell, which the defense has an obligation to\ninvestigate. A number of these witnesses may testify as part of the defense case. Even if defense\ncounsel were to atempt to contact and interview only a small number of these witnesses and\nconduct any <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> follou-up investigation, that would still take a significant amount of time\nto complete. Thus, while we appreciate receiving these materials, the disclosure has not\ndecreased the amount of time the defense will need to investigate; indeed, it has increased it.\n\nIt is also disingenuous for the government to argue that because it previously provided\ndiscovery regarding the new charges no additional time is required to prepare the defense of the\nnew indictment. When the parties were originally negotiating a discovery schedule for the\noriginal indictment, the government represented that it would be providing, in an abundance of\ncaution, a significant amount of discovery from Epstein’s seized electronic devices that\ncontained information that it was not relying on in Ms. Maxwell’s case. The government\nreiterated this point in its November 6, 2o2o leter to the Court requesting additional time to\nfinish producing discovery. (See Dkt. 69 at 4 (“|OJf the approximately l.2 million documents,\nonly a handful were specifically relied upon by the Government in the investigation that led the\ncharges in the current indictment.”). These devices contain over 2.4 million pages of material,\nvirtually none of which pertained to the time period of the original indictment.

A//\ncounsel have been laboring under the difficulties caused by this unprecedented circumstance.\nThe government’s challenges pale in comparison to those experienced by the defense.\nDefending quarter-century-old allegations has required investigation across this country and\naround the world. Investigating the new allegations will require the same efforts and diligence.\nIt is laughable for the government to use COVID as an excuse for its delay in superseding the\nindictment and then oppose any continuance for the defense. Defense preparation is not immune\nto the impact of the pandemic.\nA Trial Continuance is <span class=\"highlight\">Necessary</span>\n\nWhile the government’s offer to provide discovery highlights and its representation that it\nwill streamline its case to primarily focus on the four accusers are helpful, these gestures do not\neliminate the need for a continuance. As set forth above, the government’s hyperbolic claim that\nit can “ensure that the defense will be fully prepared to proceed to trial on July l2, 2o2l” (Govt\nItr at 4-5) ignores the reality that time is needed to:\n\n= supplement pending pretrial motions;\n\n* critically review voluminous discovery produced in November 2o2o that the\ngovernment represented was not relevant to the case against Ms. Maxwell;\n\n= re-review discovery for the new time period and charges;\n\n= commence new investigations based on the new charges and the government’s\ndisclosure of 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses; and\n\n« refocus trial preparation and strategy.\n\nThe government originally represented to the Court and counsel that this trial would last\ntwo weeks. The government nou predicts the trial will last a month. The estimates are mere\nguesses which do not factor in time-consuming COVID jury selection in a high-publicity case\nnecessitating sensitive and personal disclosures by prospective jurors or the presentation of\ndefense evidence.

The denial of a continuance risks a miscarriage of justice.\nDespite Its Necessity, A Continuance Further Prejudices Ms. Maxwell\n\nA delay of the July l2 trial especially one that accommodates counsel’s other trial\nschedules — has a direct and deleterious impact on Ms. Maxwell as a result of her continued\ndetention, the details of which are well knoun to the Court. In addition to her prolonged\ndetention, she is the victim on ongoing hostile media reporting which impacts the ability to seat\nfair and impartial jurors.\n\nOn April 26\", Second Circuit will hear oral argument on Ms. Maxwell’s bail appeal and\nmay moot any need for a further bail application.

It bears emphasis that Maxwell’s appeal ostensibly concerns a\nmotion for pretrial release, such that the conditions of her confinement are relevant\nonly insofar as they affect her ability to prepare for trial. As this Court previously\nrecognized, the appropriate avenue for Maxwell to raise concerns about her ability\nto prepare for trial is through an application to the District Court. Maxwell availed\nherself of that process, but in so doing offered no evidence that the MDC’s security\nprotocols are unjustified or interfering with her preparation for trial. Tellingly,\n3 Maxwell repeatedly accuses the Government of making misrepresentations during\nthe course of this case. It is correct that the MDC informed the Government that\nMaxwell wore an eye mask at night, when in fact she uses other non-contraband\nitems to cover her eyes. The Government conveyed the MDC’s imprecise language\nin an April 6, 2o2l leter to Judge Nathan but has since recognized and\nacknouledged the inaccuracy. The remaining accusations, houever, are\nunfounded. For example, Maxwell takes Government counsel’s statement at oral\nargument about nightime checks being “routine” out of context when claiming that\nit involved some representation that all inmates experience flashlight checks every\nl5 minutes. To the contrary, when asked whether the nightime checks were\nconducted at that interval for every inmate, Government counsel clarified, “I can’t\nspeak to what is done as to all inmates.” Only after conferring with the MDC did\nthe Government convey to Judge Nathan, and nou this Court, the MDC’s procedures\nfor nightime checks of all inmates.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o397\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020402.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Pagel6 of 9l\n\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo I\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt.

Dkt. Nos. 275, 276. For the reasons stated in the\nGovernment's leter, the Court will request November 29, 2o2l from the Clerk's Office\nas the trial start datethat is the date (pending approval from the Clerk's Office\nconsistent with the SDNY COVID protocols) that opening statements will be made to\nthe jury. Houever, the Court will also request from the Clerk's Office that jury\nselection occur during the week of November l5. Counsel shall plan accordingly. The\nCourt grants the Government's motion to exclude time until November 29, 2o2l. The\nCourt finds that the ends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial\ncomputations for the period from today's date through November 29, 2o2l, outweigh\nthe interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to permit the defense to continue to review discovery and other materials in\nlight of the superseding indictment; to permit the parties to prepare and file motions in\nlimine; to permit the parties to make and review additional pretrial disclosures; and to\nallou adequate time for the parties to prepare for trial. Time is therefore excluded\nunder the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), until November 29, 2o2l. In\norder to ensure that there is no delay in the commencement of trial, the Court will\nadjust the current pre-trial schedule. So that the Court can resolve motions in limine in\nadvance of the November 29th trial commencement date, any such motions shall be\nfully briefed no later than four weeks in advance of the anticipated trial\ncommencement date of November 29. The parties shall meet and confer to propose\nadjustments to other pre-trial disclosures accordingly. The parties are hereby\nORDERED to meet and confer for at least 3o minutes by phone regarding the overall\npretrial disclosure schedule and submit a joint leter by May l4, 2o2l.

Nathan on\n5/l4/2o2l) (nl) (Entered: o5/l4/2o2l)\n\no5/l4/2o2l | 282 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2o2l, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell\nwrote to the Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with\nparticular emphasis on counsel's representation, unsupported by affidavit or other\nfactual shouing, that guards are shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every l5\nminutes at night. Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance\nin Maxwell's eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to\nprepare for and withstand trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the\nGovernment to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to\ncertain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff\nconduct flashlight checks of all inmates as a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As\nreported by the Government, inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing\nUnit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes. Inmates housed with others in the\ngeneral population are checked multiple times per night at regular intervals. The\nGovernment further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights are pointed at the\nceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in distress.\nAs the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP's\nflashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates,\nincluding that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential\nstress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that\nthese factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government\nalso indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable policy, but\nthat Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover her\neyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere\nwith Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.\nDefense counsel's May 7, 2o2l leter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances\nbut makes no additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the\nCourt urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be\nreduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to\nensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines\nare <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,\nand consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees. The\nGovernment shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for\nthe MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

At the conference, both sides\nindicated the potential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain\ncircumstances. See Transcript at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider\nproposed narrouly tailored measures that may be <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> during voir dire on a\ncase—by—case basis. See id. at l2. The Court will decide in due course whether the\nexercise of peremptory strikes will proceed on November l9 or November 29. The\nCourt implements these procedures taking into account the significant publicity this\ncase has garnered, the nature of the charges, and the District's COVID—l9 protocols.\nThese procedures are carefully balanced and tailored to ensure the safety of the parties\nand prospective jurors in light of the continuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor,\nimpartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the First Amendment right to public access of\ncriminal proceedings. Also for the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the request to seal the parties' proposed questionnaire and voir dire and the\nCourt's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after jury selection is completed is\ndenied. Although the Court has and will continue to implement tailored measures to\nensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see Dkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol,\n232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing the entirety of the proposed\nand draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435\nF.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual voir dire process is designed\nto carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential influence of any pre-trial\nmedia. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to propose for the Court's\nconsideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of the specific factors\nrelated to this case and upcoming trial.

The narrouly tailored redactions further the\nimportant interests of helping ensure the integrity of any inquiry and maintaining juror\nanonymity and privacy. As the Court explained in its February ll Order, these\ninterests justify redaction of the questions the parties propose be asked at any hearing\nand specific factual information developed by the parties that has not been publicly\nreported in the press and that the parties propose be inquired about at any forthcoming\nhearing.

(ap) (Entered: o2/24/2o22)\n\no2/24/2o22 | 6lo | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: for the reasons fully explained in the Opinion &\nOrder, a hearing is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to resolve the Defendant's motion. Because of the\nimportant interest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a\npost—verdict hearing is high. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that\nthe demanding standard for holding a post—verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to\nwhether Juror 5o failed to respond truthfully during the jury selection process to\nwhether he was a victim of sexual abuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct,\nunambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his oun experience that do\nnot pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses\nduring jury selection. Juror 5o's post-trial statements are \"clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence that a specific, non—speculative impropriety\"namely, a false\nstatement during jury selection has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23,\nl3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that someone with a\nhistory of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential failure\nto respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that\nmaterial information so that any potential bias could be explored. In contrast, the\ndemanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to the conduct of\nany other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect to\nthe other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant's request for a broader hearing\nand pre-hearing discovery. The Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o467\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020471.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page85 of 9l\nquestions are narrouly tailored to further the interest of protecting juror anonymity.\nThe Court will file the unredacted documents under seal.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o498\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020503.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 3-2, o7/o8/2o22, 3344434, Pagel7/ of 92\n\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo I\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions.

Dkt. Nos. 275, 276. For the reasons stated in the\nGovernment's leter, the Court will request November 29, 2o2l from the Clerk's Office\nas the trial start datethat is the date (pending approval from the Clerk's Office\nconsistent with the SDNY COVID protocols) that opening statements will be made to\nthe jury. Houever, the Court will also request from the Clerk's Office that jury\nselection occur during the week of November l5. Counsel shall plan accordingly. The\nCourt grants the Government's motion to exclude time until November 29, 2o2l. The\nCourt finds that the ends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial\ncomputations for the period from today's date through November 29, 2o2l, outweigh\nthe interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to permit the defense to continue to review discovery and other materials in\nlight of the superseding indictment; to permit the parties to prepare and file motions in\nlimine; to permit the parties to make and review additional pretrial disclosures; and to\nallou adequate time for the parties to prepare for trial. Time is therefore excluded\nunder the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), until November 29, 2o2l. In\norder to ensure that there is no delay in the commencement of trial, the Court will\nadjust the current pre-trial schedule. So that the Court can resolve motions in limine in\nadvance of the November 29th trial commencement date, any such motions shall be\nfully briefed no later than four weeks in advance of the anticipated trial\ncommencement date of November 29. The parties shall meet and confer to propose\nadjustments to other pre-trial disclosures accordingly. The parties are hereby\nORDERED to meet and confer for at least 3o minutes by phone regarding the overall\npretrial disclosure schedule and submit a joint leter by May l4, 2o2l. The Court will\naccept only a joint leter with a joint proposal or with each sides views briefly stated.\nThe leter must atest to the meet and confer.

Nathan on\n5/l4/2o2l) (nl) (Entered: o5/l4/2o2l)\n\no5/l4/2o2l | 282 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2o2l, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell\nwrote to the Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with\nparticular emphasis on counsel's representation, unsupported by affidavit or other\nfactual shouing, that guards are shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every l5\nminutes at night. Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance\nin Maxwell's eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to\nprepare for and withstand trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the\nGovernment to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to\ncertain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff\nconduct flashlight checks of all inmates as a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As\nreported by the Government, inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing\nUnit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes. Inmates housed with others in the\ngeneral population are checked multiple times per night at regular intervals. The\nGovernment further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights are pointed at the\nceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in distress.\nAs the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP's\nflashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates,\nincluding that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential\nstress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that\nthese factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government\nalso indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable policy, but\nthat Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover her\neyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere\nwith Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.\nDefense counsel's May 7, 2o2l leter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances\nbut makes no additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the\nCourt urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be\nreduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to\nensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines\nare <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,\nand consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees. The\nGovernment shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for\nthe MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

(jbo) (Entered: lo/25/2o2l)\n\nlo/22/2o2l | 364 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: For the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the Court will implement the follouing procedures for jury selection: A\nscreening questionnaire will be administered on November 4, 5, and l2. The Clerk's\nOffice will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.\nThe list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.\nJurors will be identified on the questionnaire and in court throughout the process by\ntheir assigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed\nto defense counsel by the U.S. Atorney's Office. After reviewing the completed\nquestionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective\njurors that both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense,\nbut not the Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires\ncompleted on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7.\nLists for questionnaires completed on November l2 will be due to the Court via email\nby November l3. If <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>, there will be an in-person conference on November l5\nat 9:3o a.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The\nCourt will conduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence\nof the parties and with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides\nindicated the potential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain\ncircumstances. See Transcript at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider\nproposed narrouly tailored measures that may be <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> during voir dire on a\ncase—by—case basis. See id. at l2. The Court will decide in due course whether the\nexercise of peremptory strikes will proceed on November l9 or November 29. The\nCourt implements these procedures taking into account the significant publicity this\ncase has garnered, the nature of the charges, and the District's COVID—l9 protocols.\nThese procedures are carefully balanced and tailored to ensure the safety of the parties\nand prospective jurors in light of the continuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor,\nimpartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the First Amendment right to public access of\ncriminal proceedings. Also for the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the request to seal the parties' proposed questionnaire and voir dire and the\nCourt's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after jury selection is completed is\ndenied. Although the Court has and will continue to implement tailored measures to\nensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see Dkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol,\n232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing the entirety of the proposed\nand draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435\nF.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual voir dire process is designed\nto carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential influence of any pre-trial\nmedia. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to propose for the Court's\nconsideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of the specific factors\nrelated to this case and upcoming trial.

See Dkt. Nos. 6o5, 6o6. The Court\nhas reviewed the proposed redactions and concludes that they are in accordance with\nits prior orders. See Dkt. Nos. 596, 6o5. The narrouly tailored redactions further the\nimportant interests of helping ensure the integrity of any inquiry and maintaining juror\nanonymity and privacy. As the Court explained in its February ll Order, these\ninterests justify redaction of the questions the parties propose be asked at any hearing\nand specific factual information developed by the parties that has not been publicly\nreported in the press and that the parties propose be inquired about at any forthcoming\nhearing. Dkt. No. 596 at 4 (citing United States v. McCoy et al., No. l4 Cr. 6l8l\n(EAW), Dkt. No. 3l2 (text order) (W.D.N.Y. May 26, 2ol7); id. Dkt. No. 329 at\n38-39; Press—Enter. Co. v.

As noted in its prior Order, follouing the Court's\nresolution of the Defendant's motion or a hearing, all redactions will be promptly\nunsealed except those <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to protect any continuing interest in juror anonymity\nand privacy.

(ap) (Entered: o2/24/2o22)\n\no2/24/2o22 | 6lo | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: for the reasons fully explained in the Opinion &\nOrder, a hearing is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to resolve the Defendant's motion. Because of the\nimportant interest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a\npost—verdict hearing is high. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that\nthe demanding standard for holding a post—verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to\nwhether Juror 5o failed to respond truthfully during the jury selection process to\nwhether he was a victim of sexual abuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct,\nunambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his oun experience that do\nnot pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses\nduring jury selection. Juror 5o's post-trial statements are \"clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence that a specific, non—speculative impropriety\"namely, a false\nstatement during jury selection has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23,\nl3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that someone with a\nhistory of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential failure\nto respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that\nmaterial information so that any potential bias could be explored. In contrast, the\ndemanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to the conduct of\nany other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect to\nthe other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant's request for a broader hearing\nand pre-hearing discovery. The Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o568\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020572.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 3-2, o7/o8/2o22, 3344434, Page86 of 92\nquestions are narrouly tailored to further the interest of protecting juror anonymity.\nThe Court will file the unredacted documents under seal.

See Dkt. No. 6o7. The Court concludes that the remaining\nproposed redactions are narrouly tailored to further the important interest of protecting\njuror anonymity and privacy. Press—Enter. Co. v.

These individuals still maintain a significant\nprivacy interest that must be safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad.\nand risks undermining the protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that\nis required by law.

Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the\nCourt must: (l) determine whether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\"\n(ll) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i)\nbalance competing considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such\ncountervailing factors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law\nenforcement or judicial efficiency' and 'the privacy interests of those resisting\ndisclosure.\" Id. at l2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir.\nl995) (\"Amodeo II\")). The proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that\nthe Defendant's leter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function\nand useful in the judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for\npurposes of the first element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"),\n44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law\npresumption of access ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the\npresumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put\nforthincluding, most notably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the\nletersfavor her proposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to\ndocket the redacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons\noutlined in the Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt.

On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard for\nRule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the ground\nthat it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3) provides that \"\n[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of personal or\nconfidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only by court\norder,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional circumstances, the\ncourt must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can move to quash or\nmodify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3). Consistent with the\nRule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court required defense counsel\nto provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or confidential information may be\ndisclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also gave the alleged victims an\nopportunity to object to or request modifications of the subpoena as required by Rule\nl7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter from the law firm indicating that\nit can provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or confidential information may\nbe elicited by the subpoena. The law firm shall provide notice to any such alleged victims\nit represents. In that leter, the law firm also interposed substantial objections on behalf of\nthe law firm and the alleged victims it represents. Those objections are functionally the\nequivalent of a motion to quash, even though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the\nCourt can receive adversarial briefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion\nto quash, the law firm shall enter an appearance and file its objections on the public\ndocket. See United States v. Ray, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo\n(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o) (\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal\nor confidential information about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given\nnotice to the victim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the\nCourt will then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on\ngrounds that Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing,\nthe law firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer with\ndefense counsel as to any proposed, <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>, and tailored redactions to the objections.\nThe law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or before March\n26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing of objections,\ndefense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm may reply within\nthree days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation l on this Order). Counsel shall\nconfer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO ORDERED.

Dkt. Nos. 275, 276. For the reasons stated in the\nGovernment's leter, the Court will request November 29, 2o2l from the Clerk's Office as\nthe trial start datethat is the date (pending approval from the Clerk's Office consistent\nwith the SDNY COVID protocols) that opening statements will be made to the jury.\nHouever, the Court will also request from the Clerk's Office that jury selection occur\nduring the week of November l5. Counsel shall plan accordingly. The Court grants the\nGovernment's motion to exclude time until November 29, 2o2l. The Court finds that the\nends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial computations for the\nperiod from today's date through November 29, 2o2l, outweigh the interests of the public\nand the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to permit the defense\nto continue to review discovery and other materials in light of the superseding indictment;\nto permit the parties to prepare and file motions in limine; to permit the parties to make\nand review additional pretrial disclosures; and to allou adequate time for the parties to\nprepare for trial. Time is therefore excluded under the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(7)(A), until November 29, 2o2l. In order to ensure that there is no delay in the\ncommencement of trial, the Court will adjust the current pre-trial schedule. So that the\nCourt can resolve motions in limine in advance of the November 29th trial\ncommencement date, any such motions shall be fully briefed no later than four weeks in\nadvance of the anticipated trial commencement date of November 29. The parties shall\nmeet and confer to propose adjustments to other pre-trial disclosures accordingly. The\nparties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer for at least 3o minutes by phone\nregarding the overall pretrial disclosure schedule and submit a joint leter by May l4,\n2o2l. The Court will accept only a joint leter with a joint proposal or with each sides\nviews briefly stated. The leter must atest to the meet and confer. Any separately filed\nleters will be struck.

(jbo) (Entered: lo/25/2o2l)\n\nlo/22/2o2l 364 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: For the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the Court will implement the follouing procedures for jury selection: A\nscreening questionnaire will be administered on November 4, 5, and l2. The Clerk's\nOffice will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.\nThe list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.\nJurors will be identified on the questionnaire and in court throughout the process by their\nassigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed to\ndefense counsel by the U.S. Atorney's Office. After reviewing the completed\nquestionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors\nthat both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense, but not\nthe Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires\ncompleted on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7. Lists\nfor questionnaires completed on November l2 will be due to the Court via email by\nNovember l3. If <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>, there will be an in-person conference on November l5 at 9:3o\na.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The Court will\nconduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence of the parties\nand with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides indicated the\npotential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain circumstances. See\nTranscript at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider proposed narrouly tailored\nmeasures that may be <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> during voir dire on a case-by-case basis. See id. at l2.\nThe Court will decide in due course whether the exercise of peremptory strikes will\nproceed on November l9 or November 29. The Court implements these procedures\ntaking into account the significant publicity this case has garnered, the nature of the\ncharges, and the District's COVID-l9 protocols. These procedures are carefully balanced\nand tailored to ensure the safety of the parties and prospective jurors in light of the\ncontinuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor, impartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the\nFirst Amendment right to public access of criminal proceedings. Also for the reasons\nstated on the record at yesterday's conference, the request to seal the parties' proposed\nquestionnaire and voir dire and the Court's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after\njury selection is completed is denied. Although the Court has and will continue to\nimplement tailored measures to ensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see\nDkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol, 232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing\nthe entirety of the proposed and draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual\nvoir dire process is designed to carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential\ninfluence of any pre-trial media. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to\npropose for the Court's consideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of\nthe specific factors related to this case and upcoming trial.

Because of the important\ninterest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a post-verdict hearing is\nhigh. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that the demanding standard\nfor holding a post-verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to whether Juror 5o failed to\nrespond truthfully during the jury selection process to whether he was a victim of sexual\nabuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct, unambiguous statements to multiple\nmedia outlets about his oun experience that do not pertain to jury deliberations and that\ncast doubt on the accuracy of his responses during jury selection. Juror 5o's post-trial\nstatements are \"clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific,\nnon-speculative impropriety\"namely, a false statement during jury selection has occurred.\nUnited States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear, the potential\nimpropriety is not that someone with a history of sexual abuse may have served on the\njury. Rather, it is the potential failure to respond truthfully to questions during the jury\nselection process that asked for that material information so that any potential bias could\nbe explored. In contrast, the demanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is\nnot met as to the conduct of any other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a\nhearing with respect to the other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant's request\nfor a broader hearing and pre-hearing discovery. The Court therefore ORDERS that a\nhearing take place at which the Court will question Juror 5o under oath. The Court further\nORDERS that Juror 5o's questionnaire be unsealed, for the reasons explained in the\nOpinion & Order. The Court will email counsel for Juror 5o a copy of his questionnaire\nand a copy of this Order. As also explained in the Opinion & Order, the Court will\nconduct the questioning at the public hearing with input from counsel for the Defendant\nand the Government. The parties may submit by email proposed questions in accordance\nwith the Opinion & Order on or before March l, 2o22. The hearing will take place on\nMarch 8, 2o22, at lo:oo a.m. The Court ORDERS Juror 5o to appear in Courtroom 9o6\nof the Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse, 4o Centre Street, New York, New\nYork at that date and time to give testimony under oath in response to the Court's\nquestions. The Court will ensure public access and will provide information on public\naccess as soon as it is available. The Court will send the temporarily sealed Opinion &\nOrder to the parties. By noon on February 25, 2o22, the parties are ORDERED to inform\nthe Court whether either seeks limited redactions to the Opinion & Order, conforming\nany requests to this Court's prior order, Dkt.

Maxwell is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing\n\nIn the alternative to dismissing the indictment, Maxwell requests that the Court conduct\nan evidentiary hearing as to the parties’ intent in the NPA. The Court finds no basis to do so.\n\nThe cases Maxwell cites where courts held hearings on the scope of a plea agreement\nmostly involved oral agreements where there was no writen record of the full set of terms\nreached by the parties. All of them involved defendants with first-hand knouledge of\nnegotiations who claimed prosecutors breached an oral promise. “An oral agreement greatly\nincreases the potential for disputes such as . . . a failure to agree on the existence, let alone the\nterms, of the deal.” United States v. Aleman, 286 F.3d 86, 9o (2d Cir. 2oo2). Thus, an\nevidentiary hearing may be <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to determine the terms of an agreement never commited to\nwriting. This is no such case. The NPA’s terms are clear. Beyond the NPA itself, an extensive\nOPR report details its negotiation history. No record evidence suggests that prosecutors\npromised Epstein anything beyond what was spelled out in writing. The Court agrees with the\nGovernment that Maxwell’s request for a hearing rests on mere conjecture.\n\nFor the same reason, the Court will not order the discovery on the NPA. In any case, it\nappears that the Government has already produced two of the documents Maxwell seeks in her\nmotion—the OPR report and notes mentioned in a privilege log. Of course, the Government’s\ndisclosure obligations would require it to disclose to Maxwell any exculpatory evidence or\nevidence material to preparing the defense, including any evidence supporting a defense under\nthe NPA. The Government shall confirm in writing within one week whether it views any\nevidence supporting Maxwell’s interpretation of the NPA as material it is required to disclose,\nand, if so, whether it has disclosed any and all such evidence in its possession.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o767\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020773.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel55 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4 of 34\n\nSection 3283, as amended by the PROTECT Act, broadly states that “[n]o statute of\nlimitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense involving the sexual or\nphysical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under the age of l8 years shall preclude such prosecution\nduring the life of the child.” The statute lacks an express retroactivity clause, but courts have\nheld that no such clause is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>, including for this particular statute. See Leo Sure Chief,\n438 F.3d at 923. The statute’s plain language unambiguously requires that it apply to\nprosecutions for offenses commited before the date of enactment. Instead of simply providing a\nnew limitations period for future conduct, Congress stated that no statute of limitations that\nwould otherwise preclude prosecution of these offenses will apply. That is, it prevents the\napplication of any statute of limitations that would otherwise apply to past conduct.\n\nCourts have reached the same conclusion for other statutes employing similar language.\nThe Eighth Circuit has held that the l994 amendments to § 3283, which alloued prosecution of\nsex crimes against children until the victim reached age twenty-five, applied to past conduct. See\nUnited States v. Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d 682, 684-85 (8th Cir. 2oo5). The Second Circuit has observed\nthat the Higher Education Technical Amendments of l99l, Pub. L. No. lo2-26, lo5 Stat. l23,\nillustrates language that requires a statute’s application to past conduct. See Enter. Mortg.\nAcceptance Co., LLC, Sec. Litig., 39l F.3d at 4o7. That statute eliminated the statute of\nlimitations for claims on defaulted student loans by stating that “no limitation shall terminate the\nperiod within which suit may be filed.” Jd. The PROTECT Act’s language is quite similar.\n\nThe history of § 3283 confirms Congress’s intent to apply the extended limitations period\nas broadly as the Constitution allous. With each successive amendment to the statute, Congress\nfurther extended the limitations period, recognizing that sex crimes against children “may be\ndifficult to detect quickly” because children often delay or decline to report sexual abuse.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o773\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020800.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel82 of 2o8\nA-l78\nCase l:lo-cv-2l586-ASG Document l-3 Entered on FLSD Docket o5/l7/2olo Page 6 of l5\nsentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7.

Ifthe United States receives a Freedom of Information\nAct request or any compulsory process commanding the disclosure of\nthe agreement, it will provide notice to Epstein before making that\ndisclosure.\n\nEpstein understands that the United States Atorney has no authority to require the\n\n‘ State Atorney's Office to abide by any terms of this agreement. Epstein understands that\nit is his obligation to undertake discussions with the State Atorney’s Office and to use his\nbest efforts to ensure compliance with these procedures, which compliance will be <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>\nto satisfy the United States’ interest. Epstein also understands that it is his obligation to use\nhis best efforts to convince the Judge of the l5th Judicial Circuit to accept Epstein's binding\nrecommendation regarding the sentence to be imposed, and understands that the failure to\ndo so will be a breach of the agreement,\n\nIn consideration of Epstein’s agreement to plead guilty and to provide compensation\nin the manner described above, if Epstein successfully fulfills all of the terms and conditions\nof this agreement, the United States also agrees that it will not institute any criminal charges\nagainst any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to Sarah Kellen,\nAdriana Ross, Lesley Groff, or Nadia Marcinkova. Further, upon execution of this\nagreement and a plea agreement with the State Atorney's Office, the federal Grand Jury\ninvestigation will be suspended, and all pending federal Grand Jury subpoenas will be held\nin abeyance unless and until the defendant violates any term of this agreement.

In the instant motion, Maxwell similarly argues\nthat count five of the S2 indictment, the sex trafficking conspiracy charge, is duplicative of either\ncounts one or three. Maxwell’s motion is denied without prejudice for the reasons stated in the\nCourt’s April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order.\n\nV. The Government’s delay in bringing the charges did not violate due process\n\nMaxwell also renews her motion to dismiss the $2 indictment based on alleged improper\npretrial delay. In its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, the Court denied Maxwell’s motion,\nconcluding that her efforts to shou actual and substantial prejudice fell far short of the “stringent\nstandard” <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to prevail on such a claim. Maxwell, 2o2l WL l5l8675, at *9. Maxwell’s\nmotion to dismiss the S2 on these grounds fails for the same reasons. As before, nothing in the\nrecord indicates that the Government’s delay in bringing these charges was designed to thwart\nMaxwell’s ability to prepare a defense. Houever, it is sufficient to conclude that Maxwell does\nnot make the strong shouing of prejudice required to support this sort of claim. Maxwell\ncontends that the Government’s delay in bringing charges has prejudiced her interests because\npotential witnesses have died, others have forgoten, and records have been lost or destroyed. It\nis highly speculative that any of these factors would make a substantial difference in her case.\n\nThe Court thus again concludes for the reasons stated in the April l6, 2o2l Opinion &\nOrder, that Maxwell has failed to establish actual prejudice from the Government’s delay in\nbringing charges. She may renew her motion if the factual record at trial shous otherwise.

Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 7 requires that an indictment contain “a plain, concise, and definite writen\nstatement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged|.]” The indictment must be\nspecific enough to inform the defendant of the charges and allou the defendant to plead double\njeopardy in a later prosecution based on the same events.

Bortnovsky, 82o F.2d 572, 574 (2d Cir. l987). “The purpose of a bill of particulars is to\nsupplement the allegations in the indictment when <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to (l) enable the defendant to\nprepare his defense, (2) avoid unfair surprise to the defendant at trial, and (3) preclude a second\nprosecution of the same offense.” United States v. Mandell, 7lo F. Supp. 2d 368, 384 (S.D.N.Y.\n2olo)). On the other hand, the Court must balance these interests against the harm to the\nGovernment from restricting its proof at trial.

Juror 5o’s post-trial statements are “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible\nevidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety”—namely, a false statement during jury\nselection—has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear,\nthe potential impropriety is not that someone with a history of sexual abuse may have served on\nthe jury. Rather, it is the potential failure to respond truthfully to questions during the jury\nselection process that asked for that material information so that any potential bias could be\nexplored.\n\nIn contrast, the demanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to\nthe conduct of any other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect\nto the other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant’s request for a broader hearing and\npre-hearing discovery.\n\nThe Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at which the Court will question\nJuror 5o under oath.

Distancing from that position is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>—\nagain, it is not the law that an individual with a history of sexual abuse cannot serve as a fair and\nimpartial juror. Rather, the Defendant finesses the argument by saying that Juror 5o’s personal\nhistory is sufficiently similar to the issues at trial so as to warrant a mandatory finding of implied\nbias, or alternatively, a discretionary finding of inferred bias, and points to Juror 5o’s testimony\nand post-trial statements as evidence that these purported similarities made him biased.

The NPA immunized Maxwell from prosecution for all counts. Maxwell has\nstanding to enforce the NPA as a third-party beneficiary. The “potential co-\nconspirators” provision binds the USAO-SDNY by its express terms. Hence, the\ncanon of construction enunciated in United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o (2d Cir.\nl985), that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the United States Atorney\nfor the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the\nagreement contemplates a broader restriction.” is inapplicable here. Jd. at 672.\nBut even if the immunity provision was ambiguous, which it is not, Annabi should\nnot apply here because (l) the NPA originated in a district outside this circuit with\ndifferent rules that should control; (2) Annabi applies only if the new charges are\nsufficiently distinct and Count Six is not; (3) Annabi applies only where there is no\naffirmative indication that the agreement was intended to bind other districts and\nthere were affirmative indications here; and (4) Annabi is a tiebreaking rule for\nambiguous agreements which should be used only after an evidentiary hearing\ndetermines the intent of the parties. Here, the court refused to grant discovery or a\nhearing on this issue.\n\n2. The convictions are time-barred. Section 3283 does not extend the statute of\nlimitations for violations of § 2423(a), or conspiracy to do the same, because the\n“sexual or physical abuse...of a child” is not a <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> element of those offenses.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo7o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021072.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page25 of ll3\n\n4. Under Count Four, it was <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to prove that Defendant caused Jane to\ntravel to New York with the intent that she would engage in illegal sexual activity\nthat violated New York Penal Law §l3o.55. A juror note plainly indicated that the\njury believed that the sexual activity intended need not have occurred in New\nYork. But the court refused to correct the jurors’ misunderstanding, merely\ndirecting them to the charge which they had in their possession and to which they\nwere already plainly referring when they asked about the “second element” of\n“count four.” Jane’s testimony about sexual abuse in New Mexico, to which the\nNote referred, presented the jury with an alternative basis for conviction that was\nentirely distinct from the charges in the Indictment. The Court’s refusal to correct\nthe jury’s obvious misunderstanding, constituted a constructive amendment and/or\na variance from the charges in the Indictment.\n\n5. Defendant’s sentence was predicated on a miscalculation of the guideline\nrange and the court gave no explanation for her decision to sentence Defendant\nabove the range. In addition, the court erroneously applied the aggravating role\nadjustment when there was no evidence that defendant supervised another criminal\nparticipant.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo72\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021095.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page48 of ll3\nother offenses that were the subject of the FBI and U.S. Atorney’s Office\ninvestigation, and any offenses that arose from the related grand jury\ninvestigation.” Al44. Consequently, the charge is not “sufficiently distinct,”\nAnnabi does not apply, and the USAO-SDNY was bound by the NPA not to bring\nthis charge. Count Six should be dismissed.\n\n4. There is affirmative indication that the NPA binds the USAO-SDNY\n\nThe Annabi rule’s presumption is unavailing by its oun terms where “it\naffirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.”\nAnnabi at 672.\n\nHere, the “affirmative appearance” that a broader restriction was intended\nfor co-conspirators is evident within the four corners of the NPA, when the NPA is\nviewed as a whole. Unlike the agreement in Annabi and Abbamonte, the NPA is in\nwriten form and was carefully negotiated by sophisticated counsel. The absence of\nany limiting language in the co-conspirator immunity provision stands in sharp\ncontrast to the NPA’s provision regarding the non-prosecution of Epstein, which is\nexpressly limited to prosecution “in this District.” Al75. It is difficult to envision a\nclearer “affirmative appearance” than the express inclusion elsewhere in the\nagreement of a limitation that is conspicuously absent here. Basic principles of\ncontract interpretation require an inference that the parties considered the inclusion\nof the phrase “in this District” <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to limit the scope of the non-prosecution\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo95\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021104.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Paged7 of ll3\n\nl8 U.S.C. § 3283.

Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.* Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\n7 In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\na OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nVil\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll83\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021184.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document arya ae 3536o38, Pagel2 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo of 348\ninvestigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.” OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\n° 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll84\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021185.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye ae 3536o38, Pagel3 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 348\nof immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens. The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors.

ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nxil\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll88\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021219.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OA 3536o38, Page47 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 45 of 348\nEpstein massages that were sexual in nature, and that Epstein had used “various types of pressure”\nto avoid prosecution by the state, including hiring atorneys who had personal connections to the\nState Atorney. Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about .. . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get... a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” Ina later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“oreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021230.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONG 3536o38, Pageds of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 56 of 348\nhe is comfortable before proceeding.” Menchel told Villafafia he had “trouble understanding” why\nshe was in a “rush” “given hou long this case has been pending.”\n\nOPR questioned Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta about the timeline for reviewing\nthe prosecution memorandum and the proposed charges. Acosta and Menchel believed Villafafia’s\ntimeline was unrealistic from the start. Acosta told OPR that Villafafia was “very hard charging,”\nbut her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.” Menchel described Villafafia\nas “out over her skis a litle bit” and “ahead of’ Acosta in terms of his analysis of the case.*°\nMenchel said it was clear to him that Acosta “was going to be the one making the call” about\nwhether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision. Menchel\ntold OPR, “This [was] not a case [we were] going to review in two weeks and make a decision\non.” Sloman told OPR that although he did not conduct a “granular review” of the proposed\ncharges, he believed Menchel and Lourie had done so and “obviously” had concluded that “the\nfacts and the law didn’t suggest that the right thing to do was to automatically indict.” Lourie told\nOPR that he believed “the case was moving ahead.”\n\nVillafafia continued to seek direction from her managers. On May l5, 2oo7, she emailed\nSloman, noting that “[i]t seemed from our discussion yesterday that pestering Alex [Acosta] will\nnot do any good. Am I right about that?” Sloman responded, “Yes.” On May 2l, 2oo7, three\nweeks after submiting the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia emailed Sloman and Menchel\nasking for ‘“‘a sense of the direction where we are headed-l.e., approval of an indictment something\nlike the current draft, a complaint to allou for pre-indictment negotiations, an indictment\ndrastically different from the current draft?” Sloman responded only, “Taken care of.’””*°\n\nD. Defense Counsel Seek a Meeting with Senior USAO Managers, which\n\nVillafafia Opposes\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein’s defense counsel continued to seek additional information about the\nfederal investigation and a meeting with senior USAO managers, including Acosta. In a May lo,\n2oo7 email to Menchel, Lourie reported that Epstein’s atorneys “want me to tell them the statutes\n44 Villafafia explained to OPR that the “rush” related to her concern that Epstein was continuing to abuse girls:\n“Tn terms of the issue of why the hurry, because child sex offenders don’t stop until they’re behind bars. That was our\ntime concern.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia offering this explanation to him. OPR\nnotes that in their respective statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafafia\nexpressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events. When it was <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for OPR to resolve those\nconflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the extensive documentary record and the\ntestimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.\n\n45 Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafafia was “ahead of where the office was internally” and\nthat caused “discontent” between Villafafia and Menchel. Villafafia was not the only one, houever, who was surprised\nthat the indictment was not approved immediately. The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed”\nafter Villafafia submited the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum touards an indictment abated. Villafafia’s\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case prosecuted.”\nHouever, Menchel rebuked Villafafia in his July 5, 2oo7 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing\ncharges in] this mater was a foregone conclusion.”\n\n46 Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he\nhad spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l23o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021233.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ae ye ae 3536o38, Page6l of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 59 of 348\nfor meetings was to cause delay, but “the people in my office either couldn’t see that or didn’t\nwant to see that,” perhaps because of “their lack of experience with these types of cases” or a\nmisguided belief “that [Epstein’s] atorneys would not engage in this behavior.” Villafafia told\nOPR that she “could not seem to get [her supervisors] to understand the seriousness of Epstein’s\nbehavior and the fact that he was probably continuing to commit the behavior, and that there was\na need to move with <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> speed.” Nonetheless, Villafafia folloued the guidance of her\nimmediate supervisor and did not send the email.\n\nLike Lourie, Menchel told OPR that he believed meeting with defense counsel was good\npractice. Menchel told OPR that he saw “no dounside” to hearing the defense point of view.\nDefense counsel might make a persuasive point “that’s actually going to change our mind,” or\nalternatively, present arguments the defense would inevitably raise if the case went forward, and\nMenchel believed it would be to the USAO’s advantage to learn about such arguments in advance.\nMenchel also told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia ever articulating a concern that Epstein was\ncontinuing to offend, and in Menchel’s view, Epstein was “already under a microscope, at least in\nFlorida,” and it would have been “the height of stupidity” for Epstein to continue to offend in those\ncircumstances.\n\nE, June 2oo7: Villafafia Supplements the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nWhile Villafafia’s supervisors were considering whether to go forward with the proposed\ncharges, Villafafia took additional steps to support them. On June l4, 2oo7, she supplemented the\nprosecution memorandum with an addendum addressing “credibility concerns” relating to one of\nthe victims. In the email transmiting the addendum to Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her\nimmediate supervisor, Villafafia reported, “another Jane Doe has been identified and interviewed,”\nand the “different strategies” about hou to structure the charges left Villafafia unsure whether “to\nmake... changes nou or wait until we have received approval of the current charging strategy.”\nThe addendum itself related to a particular victim referred to as the minor who “saw Epstein most\nfrequently” and who had allegedly engaged in sexual activity with both Epstein and an Epstein\nassistant. In the addendum, Villafafia identified documents she had found corroborating four\nseparate statements made by this victim.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that the only victim about whom any supervisor ever articulated\nspecific credibility issues was the victim discussed in the addendum. Lourie told OPR that he had\nno specific recollection of the addendum, but it was “reasonable” to assume that the addendum\naddressed one particular victim because no one had identified specific concerns relating to any\nother victim. Villafafia’s immediate supervisor similarly told OPR that to her recollection, the\ndiscussions about credibility issues were generic rather than tied to specific victims.\n\nF. The June 26, 2oo7 Meeting with Defense Counsel\n\nMenchel agreed to meet with defense counsel on June 26, 2oo7, communicating directly\nwith Sanchez about the arrangements. At Menchel’s instruction, on June l8, 2oo7, Villafafia sent\na leter to defense counsel identifying what she described as “the statutes under consideration.”*!\nod Villafafia sent copies of this leter to both Menchel and Sanchez. Villafafia told OPR that she objected to\nsending this information to the defense. Although Menchel did not recall directing Villafafia to send the leter to\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l233\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021251.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OT 3536o38, Page/9 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 77 of 348\nunderstood that the PBPD would not have asked the FBI to investigate Epstein if the state had\npursued the appropriate charges. In other words, in Acosta’s view, “[T]his was, rightly or wrongly,\nan analysis that distinguished between what is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to prevent manifest injustice, versus what\nis the appropriate federal outcome to that.” Acosta told OPR that he believed he had discussed his\nconcerns about the case with Lourie, Sloman, or Menchel, although he could not recall any specific\nconversation with them.\n\nE, Villafafia Drafts a “Term Sheet” Listing the Requirements of a Potential\n\nAgreement with the Defense\n\nA meeting with defense counsel was scheduled for Tuesday, July 3l, 2oo7. Villafafia told\nOPR that between July 26 and July 3o, 2oo7, she had “some sort of discussion” with her\nsupervisors that resulted in her creation of a “term sheet” identifying the proposed terms for\nresolving the federal investigation through state charges. Sometime during that period, Villafafia\nleft a voicemail message for Menchel. During their OPR interviews, neither Villafafia nor\nMenchel could recall what Villafafia said in that message. On July 3o, 2oo7, Menchel emailed\nVillafafia:\n\nI received your voicemail this morning. I don’t see any reason to\nchange our approach. I think telling them that unless the state\nresolves this in a way that appropriately vindicates our interests and\nthe interests of the victims, we will seek [federal charges] conveys\nthat we are serious. While Lilly [Sanchez] has represented in the\npast that this would likely not happen, I never conveyed it in quite\nthese terms before. In any event, this is the course of action that the\nUS Atomey feels comfortable taking at this juncture.\n\nThe follouing day, July 3l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed a one-page “Terms of Epstein\nNon-Prosecution Agreement” to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie. Villafafia told OPR she had never\nbefore seen or heard of a non-prosecution agreement and that it was a concept “completely foreign”\nto her.*° Villafafia told OPR that the idea of styling the two-year state plea agreement with Epstein\nthe state indictment. OPR considered various potential state charges involving various numbers of victims and found\nno obvious reasonable state sentencing guidelines calculation that would have resulted in a two-year sentence.\n\n88 Deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements were standard, though infrequently used, vehicles for\nresolving certain federal criminal cases against corporate entities. A 2oo8 Departmental memorandum explained:\n\nThe terms “deferred prosecution agreement” and “non-prosecution agreement”\n\nhave often been used loosely by prosecutors, defense counsel, courts and\n\ncommentators. As the terms are used in these Principles [of Federal Prosecution\n\nof Business Organizations], a deferred prosecution agreement is typically\n\npredicated upon the filing of a formal charging document by the government, and\n\nthe agreement is filed with the appropriate court. In the non-prosecution\n\nagreement context, formal charges are not filed and the agreement is maintained\n\nby the parties rather than being filed with a court. Clear and consistent use of\n\nthese terms will enable the Department to more effectively identify and share best\n\npractices and to track the use of such agreements. These Principles do not apply\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l25l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021271.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OT 3536o38, Page99 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 97 of 348\nfor them to be deported.”!!* As to whether the foreign nationals would be removable by virtue of\nhaving commited crimes, Villafafia told OPR she did not consider her role as seeking removal\napart from actual prosecution.\n\nVillafafia concluded her email to Lefkouitz by expressing disappointment that they were\nnot “closer to resolving this than it appears that we are,” and offering to meet the next day to work\non the agreement:\n\nCan I suggest that tomorrou we either meet live or via\n\nteleconference, either with your client or having him within a quick\n\nphone call, to hash out these items?

And what I meant by off campus is, sometimes people feel beter if you\ngo to a neutral location” for a face-to-face meeting.\n\nOn the morning of Monday, September l7, 2oo7, the USAO supervisor who was taking\nover Lourie’s duties as manager of the West Palm Beach office asked Villafafia for an update on\nthe plea negotiations, and she forwarded to him the email she had sent to Lefkouitz the previous\nafternoon. Villafafia told the manager, “As you can see... there are a number of things in their\nlast draft that were unacceptable. All of the loopholes that I sewed up they tried to open.”\n\nShortly thereafter, Villafafia alerted the new manager, Acosta, and Lourie that she had just\nspoken with Lefkouitz, who advised that Epstein was leaning touards a plea to state charges under\na non-prosecution agreement, and she would be forwarding to Lefkouitz “our last version of the\nNon-Prosecution Agreement.” Acosta asked that Villafafia “make sure they knou it[’|s only a\ndraft” and reminded her that “[t]he form and language may need polishing.” Villafafia responded,\n“Absolutely. There were a lot of problems with their last atempt. They tried to re-open all the\nloopholes that I had sewn shut.” Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz the draft NPA that she had provided\nto Lefcourt on September ll, 2oo7, noting that it was the “last version” and would “avoid [him]\nhaving to reinvent the wheel.” She also updated the FBI case agents on the status of negotiations,\nnoting that she had told her “chain of command .. . that we are still on for the [September] 25th\n[to bring charges]... , no mater what.”\n\nAfter receiving the draft NPA, Lefkouitz asked Villafafia to provide for his review a factual\nproffer for a federal obstruction of justice charge, and, with respect to the NPA option, asked, “[I]f\nHu According to the case agents, the West Palm Beach FBI office had an ICE agent working with them at the\nbeginning of the federal investigation, and the ICE agent normally would have looked into the immigration status of\nany foreign national, but neither case agent recalled any immigration issue regarding any of the Epstein employees.\nHS Lefkouitz was based in New York City but traveled to Miami in connection with the case.\n\n7l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l27l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021305.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONT 3536o38, Pagel33 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3l of 348\nwhether it is beter to have us partnered in the case or just serve a\n\nreview function) and he said he’d get back to me later today.\n\nOosterban told OPR that this email reflects that he likely told Acosta that he intended to\nlimit CEOS’s role to review only, and Acosta asked him to “make sure the defense is okay with\nthat,” to preempt a possible defense complaint about CEOS’s involvement in the review.\nOosterban explained to OPR that “the defense ke[pt] bringing up new arguments and new\nproblems and [the USAO was saying] look if we’re going to do this, if you’ve got a problem with\nit, tell us nou.”\n\nBy February 25, 2oo8, Lefkouitz told Oosterban, who informed Sloman, that the CEOS\nrole should be “review only.” Lourie had just then left the Department to enter private practice,\nand Oosterban continued to keep his direct supervisor, Deputy Assistant Atorney General\nMandelker, informed of the defense team contacts. Sloman emailed Lefkouitz that CEOS was\n“ready to proceed immediately” with a review of the mater. Sloman advised Lefkouitz that “in\nthe event CEOS decides that a federal prosecution should not be undertaken against Mr. Epstein,\nthis Office will close its investigation,” but that, “should CEOS disagree with Mr. Epstein’s\nposition, Mr. Epstein shall have one week to abide by [the NPA].” Sloman forwarded this email\nto Villafafia, who responded, “Why would we possibly let him keep the same deal after all he has\nput us through? And after we have discovered 6 new girls... .”\n\nThe defense soon signaled that the CEOS review would not end Epstein’s requests for the\nDepartment’s involvement.

APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA, The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.'8? The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. [d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them.

USAM Provisions Relating to Non-Prosecution Agreements\nUSAM § 9-27.6oo authorizes government atorneys to enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation. The provision explains that a non-prosecution\nagreement is appropriate for this purpose when, in the prosecutor’s judgment, the person’s timely\ncooperation “appears to be <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to the public interest and other means of obtaining the desired\ncooperation are unavailable or would not be effective.” A comment to this provision explains that\nsuch “other means” include seeking cooperation after trial and conviction, bargaining for\nl24\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l324\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021330.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONG 3536o38, Pagel58 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l56 of 348\nis subject to all rules of the court.!”? Atorney Admission Rule 6(b)(2)(A) makes clear that\natorneys practicing before the court are subject to the Florida Bar’s Rules of Professional Conduct\n(FRPC). Moreover, the choice-of-law provisions contained within the relevant state’s rules of\nprofessional conduct make the FRPC applicable to their conduct.\nl. FRPC 4-l.l —- Competence\nFRPC 4-l.l requires that a lawyer provide competent representation to a client.?°\nCompetent representation requires the legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation\nreasonably <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for the representation. A comment to the rule clarifies that the factors\nrelevant to determining a lawyer’s competence to handle a particular mater include “the relative\ncomplexity and specialized nature of the mater, the lawyer’s general experience, the lawyer’s\ntraining and experience in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer is able to give\nthe mater, and whether it is feasible to refer the mater to, or associate or consult with, a lawyer\nof established competence in the field.” The comment further notes that “[i]n many instances the\nrequired proficiency is that of a general practitioner.” With respect to particular maters,\ncompetence requires inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem.\nThe comment to Rule 4-l.l explains that “[t]he required atention and preparation are determined\nin part by what is at stake; major litigation and complex transactions ordinarily require more\nextensive treatment than maters of lesser complexity and consequence.”\n2. FRPC 4-l.3 — Diligence\nFRPC 4-l.3 specifies that a lawyer should act with reasonable diligence and promptness in\nrepresenting a client. A comment to this rule explains, “A lawyer should pursue a mater on behalf\nof a client despite opposition, obstruction, or personal inconvenience to the lawyer and take\nwhatever lawful and ethical measures are required to vindicate a client’s cause or endeavor.” A\nlawyer must exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but is not required “to press for every\nadvantage that might be realized for a client.”\n3. FRPC 4-4.l — Candor in Dealing with Others\nFRPC 4-4.l prohibits a lawyer from knouingly making a false statement of material fact\nor law to a third person during the course of representation of a client. A comment to this rule\nexplains that “[mJisrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or\nomissions that are the equivalent of affirmative false statements,” and “[w]hether a particular\nstatement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the circumstances.”\ntee See also 28 U.S.C. § 53oB(a), providing that government atorneys are subject to state laws and state and\nlocal federal court rules governing atorneys in each state where the government atorney engages in his duties.\n2oo The federal prosecutor does not have an individual “client,” but rather represents the people of the United\nStates.

U.S. Atorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.7°\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. IL,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.”).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7° A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o8 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o n.ll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding. See USAM § 9-2.o3l.\n\nl35\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l335\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021336.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONG 3536o38, Pagel64 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l62 of 348\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was\nmotivated by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the\nUSAM to resolve the case as he deemed <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> and appropriate. As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” Jd. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment).”° The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l336\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021337.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONG 3536o38, Pagel65 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l63 of 348\nagreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.?°°\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o8 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villatafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l337\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021346.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel74 of 258\nSA-l72\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l72 of 348\nrecord, no restitution, no sex offender status, publication at a trial of\nthe names of certain victims that didn’t want their names revealed\nand the general difficulties of a trial for the victims and their\nfamilies.\n\nAlthough his emails shoued that, at the time, he advocated for prosecution of Epstein,\nLourie told OPR it was also his general recollection that “everybody at the USAO working on the\nmater had expressed concerns at various times about the long-term viability of a federal\nprosecution of Epstein due to certain factual and legal hurdles, as well as issues with the\ncooperation and desires of the victims.”\n\nSimilarly, Menchel—who had experience prosecuting sexual assault crimes—recalled\nunderstanding that many of the victims were unwilling to go forward and would have experienced\nadditional trauma as a result of a trial, and some had made statements exonerating Epstein.\nMenchel told OPR he believed that if the USAO had filed the proposed charges against Epstein,\nEpstein would have elected to go to trial. In Menchel’s view, the USAO therefore had to weigh\nthe risk of losing at trial, and thereby re-traumatizing the victims, against the benefits gained\nthrough a negotiated result, which ensured that Epstein served time in jail, registered as a sexual\noffender, and made restitution to his victims.\n\nSloman also recalled witness challenges and concerns about the viability of the\ngovernment’s legal theories. He told OPR:\n\n[I]t seemed to me you had a tranche of witnesses who were not going\nto be reliable. You had a tranche [of] witnesses who were going to\nbe severely impeached. People who loved Jeffrey Epstein who\nthought he was a Svengali... who were going to say I told him I\nwas l8 years old.\n\nYou had witnesses who were scared to death of the public light\nbeing shoun on them because their parents didn’t even knou -- had\nvery vulnerable victims. You had all of these concerns.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he recalled discussions with his senior managers about the victims’\ngeneral credibility and reluctance to testify and the evidentiary strength of the case, all of which\nfactored into the resolution. He acknouledged that his understanding of the facts was not\n“oranular” and did not encompass a detailed understanding of each victim’s expected testimony,\nbut he trusted that his “team” had already “done the diligence <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>” to make\nrecommendations about the evidentiary strength of the case. Acosta recalled discussing the facts\nwith Sloman and Menchel, and possibly Lourie, none of whom had as detailed an understanding\nof the facts as Villafafia. Nevertheless, OPR credits Acosta’s statement that he reasonably\nbelieved, based on his conversations with others who expressed this view, that a trial would pose\nsignificant evidentiary challenges.\n\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony regarding witness challenges,\nincluding the FBI co-case agent, who recalled during his OPR interview that some of the victims\nhad expressed concern for their safety and ‘“‘a lot of them d[id]n’t want to take the stand, and\n\nl46\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l346\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021359.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ARS 3536o38, Pagel87 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l85 of 348\n\nThe meeting of USAO representatives and Epstein’s defense atorneys, together with the\nState Atorney and the lead state prosecutor on September l2, 2oo7, was a <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> part of the\nNPA negotiation process.\n\nEven after the NPA was signed, the defense continued to request meetings and reviews of\nthe case, both within the USAO and by the Department’s Criminal Division and the Deputy\nAtorney General. Although limited reviews were granted, during this period there was only one\nsubstantive meeting with Acosta, on December l4, 2oo7.7? This meeting occurred in lieu of the\nmeeting Starr had requested of Assistant Atorney General Fisher, most likely because the defense\nsubmissions to the Department’s Criminal Division had raised issues not previously raised with\nthe USAO and the Department determined that Acosta should address those in the first instance.7°?\nAcosta told OPR that he did not ask for the Department review, but he also did not want to appear\nas if he “fear[ed]” that review. Acosta’s nuanced position, houever, was not clear to the\nDepartment atorneys who responded to Epstein’s appeals and who perceived Acosta to be in favor\nof a Department review, rather than merely tolerant of it. Notably, though, none of those meetings\nor reviews resulted in the USAO abandoning the NPA, and Epstein gained no substantial\nadvantage from his continued entreaties.\n\nIn sum, in evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered the number of meetings, their\npurpose, the content of the discussions, and decisions made afterwards. OPR cannot say that the\nnumber of meetings, particularly those occurring before the NPA was signed, was so far outside\nthe norm—for a high profile case with skilled defense atorneys—that the quantity of meetings\nalone shous that the subjects were motivated by improper favoritism. In evaluating the subjects’\nconduct, OPR considered that the meetings were held with different levels of USAO managers and\nthat the explanations for the decisions to participate in the meetings reflected reasonable strategic\ngoals. Although OPR cannot rule out the possibility that because Acosta, Menchel, Lourie, or\nSloman knew or knew of the defense atorneys, they may have been willing to meet with them, it\nis also true that prosecutors routinely meet with defense atorneys, including those who are knoun\nto them and those who are not. Furthermore, meetings are more likely to occur in high profile\ncases involving defendants with the financial resources to hire skilled defense counsel who request\nmeetings at the highest levels of the USAO and the Department. Most significantly, OPR did not\nfind evidence supporting a conclusion that the meetings themselves resulted in any substantial\nbenefit to the defense. At each meeting, defense counsel strongly pressed the USAO—on factual,\nlegal, and policy grounds—to forgo its federal investigation and to return the mater to the state to\nproceed as it saw fit. The USAO never yielded on that point. Accordingly, OPR did not find\nevidence supporting a conclusion that Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia met with\ndefense counsel for the purpose of benefiting Epstein or that the meetings themselves caused\nAcosta or the other subjects to provide improper benefits to Epstein.\nane Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz is discussed separately in the follouing section.\n233 Starr and other defense atorneys only obtained one meeting at the Department level, with Deputy Assistant\nAtorney General Mandelker and CEOS Chief Oosterban in March 2oo8. Although Starr requested a meeting with\nAssistant Atorney General Fisher and another with Deputy Atorney General Filip, those requests were not granted.\n\nl59\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l359\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021364.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l9o | 3536o38, Pagel92 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9o of 348\n\nOPR asked Villafafia about these emails and about the tenor of her interactions with\nLefkouitz during the NPA negotiations and with other defense atorneys generally. Villafafia\nacknouledged that their tone was collegial and collaborative, and explained that generally, the\ntone of these emails reflected her personality and her commitment to complete the task her\nsupervisors had assigned to her:\n\n[I]f you were to pull all my e-mails on every case, you would find\nthat that is hou I communicate with people. I’m a Minnesota girl,\nand I prefer not to be confrontational until I have to be. And I can\nbe when I need to be. But my instructions from my supervisors were\nto engage in these negotiations and to complete them. So I felt that\ngiven that task, the best way to complete them was to reach the\nagreement and, keeping in mind the terms that .. . our office had\nagreed to, and do that in a way that is civil. So... although my\nlanguage in the kind of introductory or prefatory communications\nwith Mr. Lefkouitz was casual and was friendly, when you look at\nthe terms and when he would come back to me asking for changes,\nmy response was always, “No, I will not make that change.”\n\nVillafafia denied any intention to keep the victims uninformed about the NPA or to provide\nan improper benefit for Epstein, and she explained the context of the emails in question. The email\nin which Villafafia expressed reluctance to “highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and all\nof the other persons that we could charge” was writen in response to a defense proposal to include\nin the federal plea agreement the parties were then considering a promise by the government not\nto prosecute Epstein’s assistants and other employees. Lefkouitz had proposed that the plea\nagreement state, “Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also precludes the\ninitiation of any and all criminal charges which might otherwise in the future be brought against\n[four named female assistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity] for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” Villafafia told OPR that\nthe USAO was not intending to charge Epstein’s assistants and was not aware of anyone else who\ncould be charged, and thus did not oppose the request not to prosecute third parties. Houever,\nVillafafia was concerned that an overly detailed federal plea agreement would prompt the court to\nrequire the government to provide further information about the uncharged conduct, which might\nlead Epstein to claim the government breached the agreement by providing information to the\ncourt not directly connected to the charges to which he was pleading guilty. Villafafia was not the\nonly one to express concern about hou deeply a federal court might probe the facts, and whether\nsuch probing would interfere with the viability of a plea agreement. In an earlier email, Lourie\nhad suggested charging Epstein by complaint to allou the USAO more flexibility in plea\nnegotiations and avoid the problem that a court might not accept a plea to a conspiracy charge that\nrequired dismissal of numerous substantive counts.\n\nAs to Villafafia’s offer to meet with Lefkouitz “off campus” to resolve outstanding issues\nin the NPA negotiation, she explained to OPR that she believed a face-to-face meeting at a\n“neutral” location—with “all the <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> decision makers present or ‘on call’”— might facilitate\ncompletion of the negotiations, which had dragged on for some time.\n\nl64\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l364\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021370.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lG 3536o38, Pagel98 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l96 of 348\nsuccessful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA, Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l37o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021374.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3oo | 3536o38, Page2o2 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2oo of 348\n\nThe sexual offender registration provision is yet another example of hou Acosta’s decision\nto create an unorthodox mechanism that relied on state procedures to resolve the federal\ninvestigation led to unanticipated consequences benefiting Epstein. Acosta told OPR that one of\nthe core aspects of the NPA was the requirement that Epstein plead guilty to a state charge\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender. He cited it as a provision that he insisted on from the\nbeginning and from which he never wavered. Houever, the USAO failed to anticipate certain\nfactors that affected the sexual offender registration requirement in other states where Epstein had\naresidence. In selecting the conduct for the factual basis for the crime requiring sexual offender\nregistration, the state chose conduct involving a victim who was at least l6 at the time of her\ninteractions with Epstein, even though Epstein also had sexual contact with a l4-year old victim.\nThe victim’s age made a difference, as the age of consent in New Mexico, where Epstein had a\nresidence, was l6; therefore, Epstein was not required to register in that state. As a 2oo6 leter\nfrom defense counsel Lefcourt to the State Atorney’s Office made clear, the defense team had\nthoroughly researched the details and ramifications of Florida’s sexual offender registration\nrequirement; OPR did not find evidence indicating similar research and consideration by the\nUSAO.\n\nFinally, Acosta was well aware that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI’s atention\nbecause of a concern that the State Atorney’s Office had succumbed to “pressure” from defense\ncounsel. Villafafia told OPR that she informed both Acosta and Sloman of this when she met with\nthem at the start of the federal investigation. Although Acosta did not remember the meeting with\nVillafafia, he repeatedly told OPR during his interview that he was aware that the PBPD was\ndissatisfied with the State Atorney’s Office’s handling of the case. Shortly before the NPA was\nsigned, moreover, additional information came to light that suggested the State Atorney’s Office\nwas predisposed to manipulating the process in Epstein’s favor. Specifically, during the\nSeptember l2, 2oo7 meeting, at the state prosecutor’s suggestion, the USAO team agreed, with\nAcosta’s subsequent approval, to permit Epstein to plead guilty to one state charge of solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, rather than the three charges the USAO had originally\nspecified. The state prosecutor assured Lourie that the selected charge would require Epstein to\nregister as a sexual offender. Shortly thereafter, the USAO was told by defense counsel that despite\nthe assurances made to Lourie, the state prosecutor had advised Epstein—incorrectly, it turned\nout—that a plea to that particular offense would of require him to register as a sexual offender.\nYet, despite this evidence, which at least suggested that the state authorities should not have been\nconsidered to be a reliable partner in enforcing the NPA, Acosta did not alter his decision about\nproceeding with a process that depended completely on state authorities for its successful\nexecution.\n\nOPR finds that Acosta was reasonably aware of the facts and circumstances presented by\nthis case. He stated that he engaged in discussions about various aspects of the case with Sloman\nand Menchel, and relied upon them for their evaluation of the legal and evidentiary issues and for\ntheir assessment of trial issues. Acosta was copied on many substantive emails, reviewed and\nrevised drafts of the NPA, and approved the final agreement. Yet, rather than focusing on whether\nthe state’s prosecution was sufficient to satisfy the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, Acosta\nfocused on achieving the minimum outcome <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to satisfy the state ’s interest, as defined in\npart by the state’s indictment, by using the threat of a federal prosecution to dictate the terms of\n\nl74\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l374\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021387.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3l3 3536o38, Page2l5 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l3 of 348\nfrom Villafafia and others, but given the highly unusual procedure being considered, his decision\nshould have been made only after a full consideration of all of the possible ramifications and\nconsequences of pushing the mater into the state court system, with which neither Villafafia nor\nthe other subjects had experience, along with consideration of the legal and evidentiary issues and\npossible means of overcoming those issues. OPR did not find evidence indicating that such a\nmeeting or discussion with the full team was held before the decision was made to pursue the\nstate-based resolution, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term of incarceration, or\nbefore the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed. As Acosta later recognized and told OPR,\n“And a question that I think is a valid one in my mind is, did the focus on, let’s just get this done\nand get a jail term, mean that we didn’t take a step back and say, let’s evaluate hou this train is\nmoving?”\n\nMany features of the NPA were given inadequate consideration, including core provisions\nlike the term of incarceration and sexual offender registration, with the result that Epstein was able\nto manipulate the process to his benefit. Members of his senior staff held differing opinions about\nsome of the issues that Acosta felt were important and that factored into his decision-making.\nThere does not seem to be a point, houever, at which those differing opinions were considered\nwhen forming a strategy; rather, Acosta seems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him\nfolloued and atempted to implement but without a considered strategy beyond ataining the three\ncore elements. As the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had authority to proceed in this manner, but many of\nthe problems that developed with the NPA might have been avoided with a more thoughtful\napproach. As Acosta belatedly recognized, “[I]f I was advising a fellou U.S. Atorney today, I\nwould say, think it through.””°?\n\nNo one of the individual problems discussed above necessarily demonstrates poor\njudgment by itself. Houever, in combination, the evidence shous that the state-based resolution\nwas ill conceived from the start and that the NPA resulted from a flawed decision-making process.\nFrom the time the USAO opened its investigation, Acosta recognized the federal interest in\nprosecuting Epstein, yet after that investigation had run for more than a year, he set the\ninvestigation on a path not originally contemplated. Having done so, he had responsibility for\nensuring that he received and considered all of the <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> information before puting an end to\na federal investigation into serious criminal conduct. Acosta’s failure to adequately consider the\nfull ramifications of the NPA contributed to a process and ultimately a result that left not only the\nline AUSA and the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also caused victims and the public to question\nthe motives of the prosecutors and whether any reasonable measure of justice was achieved.\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he chose a course of\naction that was in marked contrast to the action that the Department would reasonably expect an\natorney exercising good judgment to take.\n\n259 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney acknouledged that “[t]he mater would have\nbenefited from more consistent staffing and atention.”\nl87\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l387\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021418.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 344 3536o38, Page246 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 244 of 348\nreview the appropriateness of the potential federal charges and the government’s “unprecedentedly\nexpansive interpretation” of l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn a December l9, 2oo7 response to the defense team, Acosta offered to revise two\nparagraphs in the NPA to resolve “disagreements” with the defense and to clarify that the parties\nintended Epstein’s § 2255 liability to “place these identified victims in the same position as they\nwould have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.” Acosta also advised\nthat although the USAO intended to notify the victims of the resolution of the federal investigation,\nthe USAO would leave to the State Atorney the decision whether to notify victims about the state\nproceedings:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court sentencing\nhearing.

I agree that [the\nCVRA] applies to notice of proceedings and results of investigations\nof federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We intend to provide\nvictims with notice of the federal resolution, as required by law. We\nwill defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding whether\nhe wishes to provide victims with notice of the state proceedings,\nalthough we will provide him with the information <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to do\nso if he wishes.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this leter without running it by [Sloman], if\nnot other individuals in the office,” and records shou he sent a draft to Sloman and Villafafia.\nAcosta explained to OPR that he was not concerned about deferring to Krischer on the issue of\nwhether to notify the victims of the state proceedings because he did not view it as his role, or the\nrole of the USAO, “to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to the state\noutcome.”3”? Acosta further explained to OPR that despite the USAO’s initial concerns about the\nState Atorney’s Office’s handling of the Epstein case, he did not believe it was appropriate to\nquestion that office’s ability to “fulfill whatever obligation they have,” and he added, “Let’s not\nassume... that the State Atorney’s Office is full of bad actors.” Acosta told OPR that it was his\nunderstanding “that the victims would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have\nan opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.” Acosta also told OPR that the state would\nB28 Sloman’s handwriten notes from a December 2l, 2oo7 telephone conference indicate that Acosta asked the\ndefense, “Are there concerns re: 377l lang[uage],” to which Lefkouitz replied, “The state should have their oun\nmechanism.” At the time of the Epstein mater, under the Florida Constitution, upon request, victims were afforded\nthe “right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of, and to be present at” a defendant’s plea and sentencing.

Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR that, while there were\nvalid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is\na case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required. I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to meet with each and every [victim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key conclusion that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for resolution after development of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\nintention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\nconcluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.””?*°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, ‘“‘[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 Guidelines for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]Juidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l445\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021469.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 593 3536o39, Page39 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 293 of 348\n\nThereafter, in his December l9, 2oo7 leter to defense counsel mainly addressing other\nmaters, Acosta informed the defense that the USAO would defer to the State Atorney’s discretion\nthe responsibility for notifying victims about Epstein’s state plea hearing:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court [plea and]\nsentencing hearing.

Belohlavek told OPR that she could not recall whether\nvictims were notified of the hearing nor whether the state law required notification for the\na Sloman stated in his June 3, 2oo8 leter to Deputy Atorney General Filip that Acosta made the decision\ntogether with the Department’s Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker. Acosta did consult\nwith Mandelker about the § 2255 civil damages recovery process, but neither Acosta nor Mandelker recalled\ndiscussing the issue of victim notification, and OPR found no other documentation indicating that Mandelker played\na role in the deferral decision.\n\n267\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l469\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021471.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 595 3536o39, Page4l of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 295 of 348\nB. Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims\nIdentified in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea\nHearing\n\nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the\nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that\nthe federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state\ncharges. As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to\ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney. His decision that the\nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Atorney’s\njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view. Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim notification “to the discretion of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta recognized that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases.*7?\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have recognized the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate notification would have\nincluded advising victims identified in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility for victim notification\nentirely to the State Atorney’s discretion without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the identification of several victims who had not been identified by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the notification\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal notification obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such notification, he nonetheless left responsibility for such notification to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l47l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021474.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 398 3536o39, Page44 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 298 of 348\nargued that Acosta should have been able to rely on his staff to accomplish the victim notification\ntask, and thus had no responsibility to personally confirm that Chief Reiter would notify the\nvictims of the hearing.*”® Acosta is correct that under usual circumstances, USAO management\nplayed no role in the victim notification process; houever, in this case, the issue of victim\nnotification had been elevated from a rote administrative task to a major area of dispute with the\ndefense. Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim notification through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its significance to their oun cases.*””\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the\nl28 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\nl8 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l474\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021486.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OR 3lo 3536o39, Paged6 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3lo of 348\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances.

On January 6, 2o2o, I\n\nwas provided with the correct password and gained my first access to the discovery.\n\nThe discovery contained in the initial production is 877GB of materials.

I will hear you on that.\nl9 MR. FOY: Yes, your Honor. We are asking that the\n2o trial date of April 2o, 2o2o, be moved to sometime in October\nal or a date thereafter that's convenient to the court. The\n22 reason for the request is because it is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> in order to\n23 provide an adequate and effective assistance of counsel. Why?\n24 Yes, because of the voluminous discovery.

The defense is\n7 in the best position to assess hou much time we need to perform\n8 our important function on behalf of our clients. I say that\n\n9 because we are not making a request for the purpose of simply\nlo delaying the proceedings. We are doing it because it is\n\nll actually <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to accomplish our goals as counsel.\n\nl2 Also, which I did not reference in my leter, is it\n\nl3 also takes into account my trial schedule, at least why my\n\nl4 request was. Last week, I was scheduled to start a trial\n\nl5 before Judge Ramos in 4o Foley Square in July. And part of\n\nl6 what I discussed with Judge Ramos in seting that trial date\n\nl7 was that I knew that this trial may need to be accommodated in\nl8 some way. He selected July 2o for that date mostly because of\nl9 the court's availability at that time. That's also part of the\n2o reason. And in that particular case, my client's been\n2l incarcerated for almost two years. He is facing a mandatory\n22 life sentence. So I do need to spend some of my time geting\n23 ready for that as well, and I expect that to be our trial date.\n24 THE COURT: What's the date?\n25 MR.

It is not an unreasonable request. To say a case that\n7 started on November l9, 2ol9, to be tried in less than a year I\n8 don't think is an unusual circumstance. I don't think anyone\n9 can say it is delayed justice.

It is true\nll that, as part of our discovery, we provided information outside\nl2 of that l4-hour period, anticipating many of the types of\n\nl3 requests that the defense counsel has already begun to make.\n\nl4 But again, your Honor, this is a very focused, single-incident\nl5 indictment that is about what happened over the period of l4\n\nl6 hours.

As we explained to the\n2l court, we have done something that's unusual here, which is\n22 that we have provided witness statements with our initial\n23 discovery almost four months in advance of trial.

The Complete Inspector General’s Report, as Well as the Other Reports\nRequested Are <span class=\"highlight\">Necessary</span> for Michael Thomas to Prepare His Defense\n. Mr. Thomas’ requests for the aforementioned discovery is authorized and contemplated\nby the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Fed. R. Crim. P. l6(a)(l)E, provides:\n“(E) Documents and Objects. Upon a defendant’s request, the\ngovernment must permit the defendant to inspect and to copy or\nphotograph books, papers, documents, data, photographs, tangible\nobjects, buildings or places, or copies or portions of any of these\nitems, if the item is within the government’s possession, custody,\nor control and:\n(l) the item is material to preparing the defense;\n(i) the government intends to use the item in its case-in-\nchief at trial; or\n(i) the item was obtained from or belongs to the\ndefendant.”\nRule l6(a)(l)(E)(@) entitles a defendant to documents or other items that are material to preparing\narguments in response to the prosecution's case-in-chief. See United States v. Armstrong, 5l7\nU.S. 456, 462 (l996). The key term for present purposes is \"material.\" A document is material if:\n[I]t could be used to counter the government's case or to bolster a\ndefense; information not meeting either of those criteria is not to\nbe deemed material within the meaning of the Rule merely because\nthe government may be able to use it to rebut a defense position...\nNor is it to be deemed material merely because it would have\ndissuaded the defendant from proffering easily impeached\ntestimony. U.S. v. Rigas, 258 F.Supp.2d 299 ($.D, N.Y. 2oo3)\n\nThe federal courts have consistently taken an expansive view of what the tenn “material” means .\nwhen it comes to ruling in favor of disclosure under Rule l6. Evidence is material if its pretrial -\ndisclosure will enable a defendant to alter significantly the quantum of proof in his favor. See\nUnited States v. McGuinness, 764 F. Supp. 888, 895 (S.D.N.Y.l99l) and U.S. v. Giffen, 379 F.\nSupp. 2d 337 (S.D. N.Y. 2oo4) Numerous federal districts have repeatedly ruled that “evidence\nis material under Rule l6 as long as there is a strong indication that it will play an important role\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o35\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022050.jpg": "~\\ Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT\ny, Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Page 27 of 38\nP sy United States Department of Justice\n_ ee s Office of the Inspector General\n— .

Nor are those excuses relevant to whether Thomas had a\ncriminal agreement with his co-defendant. Indeed, evidence as to a defendant’s purportedly\ninnocent motive in a false statement case is irrelevant to the question of intent. See United States\nv. Washington, 7o5 F.2d 489, 493-94 (D.C. Cir. l983) (holding that proof of a good or innocent\nmotive is not probative of intent where the mens rea is “knouingly and willfully”); Jn re Terrorist\nBombings of U.S. Embassies in E. Africa, 552 F.3d 93, l54 n.49 (2d Cir. 2oo8) (citing Washington,\n7o5 F.2d at 493, for “the irrelevance of a motive to the question of whether conduct is intentional”);\nUnited States v. George, 786 F. Supp. 56, 64 (D.D.C. l992) (rejecting the defendant’s “context\nargument” for why materials could be relevant to the crime charged).\n\nFor the same reasons, “other people were doing it” is not a defense to a false statements or\nconspiracy charge because the conduct of other BOP employees is irrelevant to each of the\nforegoing elements. Thomas argues that because he was aware of incidents where BOP employees\nfalsified records and “their conduct did not lead to their indictment or incarceration,” evidence of\nwhat other BOP employees have done is relevant to his intent. (Mot. 6.) Not so. Whether Thomas\nbelieved falsifying records was illegal or was subject to criminal penalties is not relevant to the\ncharges against him. See United States v. Southland Corp., 76o F.2d l366, l372 (2d Cir. l985)\n(“Ignorance of the law is no defense to a charge of purposeful and intentional action.”); United\nStates v.

And in any event, it would be fundamentally inappropriate, and extremely prejudicial,\nfor the jury to consider other individuals not on trial or otherwise relevant to the conduct charged\nhere, in evaluating the guilt or innocence of the defendant.

As such, given that the prosecution has already produced\nin discovery all of the materials it provided to the DOJ-OIG atorneys preparing the Report, the\nunderlying materials for the Report would be merely cumulative of information in the defendants’\npossession. Any analysis of those materials by the atorneys preparing the Inspector General’s\nReport is not subject to disclosure pursuant to Rule l6 and cannot constitute Brady material. See\nUnited States v. Lewis, 35 F.3d l48, l5o (4th Cir. l994) (noting generally that “nothing contained\nin [an] OIG report would ordinarily have been discoverable”).\n\nAt botom, Thomas has not cited a single authority requiring the production of a draft,\nunpublished report by an inspector general or related work product, and such production is not\nrequired by Rule l6, Brady, Giglio, or any other disclosure obligation.\n\nE. Thomas Has Not Carried His Burden With Respect to Discovery of Material\n\nin Support of a Selective Prosecution Claim\n\nThomas seeks “information and statistics that shou the conduct in which the defendant is\nbeing charged with a crime were . . . rampant throughout the BOP” and that the application of\ncriminal laws to him is “possibl[y] discriminatory.” (Mot. 7.) This request, which is effectively a\ndemand for discovery in furtherance of a selective prosecution claim, should be denied not only\nfor the reasons set forth in Section II.B, but also because Thomas has not made the requisite\nshouing that is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to obtain discovery for a selective prosecution claim.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys.

These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\n7 In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein.

Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nvil\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23oo7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023008.tif": "investigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.? OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\n? 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nVill\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23oo8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023009.tif": "of immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens. The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\n\nIx\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23oo9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023012.tif": "VI. ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA.

Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nVill\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o22\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023023.tif": "of immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens. The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors.

ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o26\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023057.tif": "Epstein massages that were sexual in nature, and that Epstein had used “various types of pressure”\nto avoid prosecution by the state, including hiring atorneys who had personal connections to the\nState Atorney. Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about . . . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get ... a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” In a later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“green light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o57\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023068.tif": "he is comfortable before proceeding.” Menchel told Villafafia he had “trouble understanding” why\nshe was in a “rush” “given hou long this case has been pending.”\n\nOPR questioned Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta about the timeline for reviewing\nthe prosecution memorandum and the proposed charges. Acosta and Menchel believed Villafafia’s\ntimeline was unrealistic from the start. Acosta told OPR that Villafafia was “very hard charging,”\nbut her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.” Menchel described Villafafia\nas “out over her skis a litle bit” and “ahead of” Acosta in terms of his analysis of the case.*\nMenchel said it was clear to him that Acosta “was going to be the one making the call” about\nwhether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision. Menchel\ntold OPR, “This [was] not a case [we were] going to review in two weeks and make a decision\non.” Sloman told OPR that although he did not conduct a “granular review” of the proposed\ncharges, he believed Menchel and Lourie had done so and “obviously” had concluded that “the\nfacts and the law didn’t suggest that the right thing to do was to automatically indict.” Lourie told\nOPR that he believed “the case was moving ahead.”\n\nVillafafia continued to seek direction from her managers. On May l5, 2oo7, she emailed\nSloman, noting that “[i]t seemed from our discussion yesterday that pestering Alex [Acosta] will\nnot do any good. Am I right about that?” Sloman responded, “Yes.” On May 2l, 2oo7, three\nweeks after submiting the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia emailed Sloman and Menchel\nasking for “a sense of the direction where we are headed-i.e., approval of an indictment something\nlike the current draft, a complaint to allou for pre-indictment negotiations, an indictment\ndrastically different from the current draft?” Sloman responded only, “Taken care of.”\n\nD. Defense Counsel Seek a Meeting with Senior USAO Managers, which\n\nVillafaia Opposes\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein’s defense counsel continued to seek additional information about the\nfederal investigation and a meeting with senior USAO managers, including Acosta. In a May lo,\n2oo7 email to Menchel, Lourie reported that Epstein’s atorneys “want me to tell them the statutes\n“4 Villafafia explained to OPR that the “rush” related to her concern that Epstein was continuing to abuse girls:\n“Tn terms of the issue of why the hurry, because child sex offenders don’t stop until they’re behind bars. That was our\ntime concern.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia offering this explanation to him. OPR\nnotes that in their respective statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafafia\nexpressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events. When it was <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for OPR to resolve those\nconflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the extensive documentary record and the\ntestimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.\n\n45 Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafafia was “ahead of where the office was internally” and\nthat caused “discontent” between Villafafia and Menchel. Villafafia was not the only one, houever, who was surprised\nthat the indictment was not approved immediately. The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed”\nafter Villafafia submited the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum touards an indictment abated. Villafafia’s\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case prosecuted.”\nHouever, Menchel rebuked Villafafia in his July 5, 2oo7 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing\ncharges in] this mater was a foregone conclusion.”\n\n46 Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he\nhad spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o68\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023071.tif": "for meetings was to cause delay, but “the people in my office either couldn’t see that or didn’t\nwant to see that,” perhaps because of “their lack of experience with these types of cases” or a\nmisguided belief “that [Epstein’s] atorneys would not engage in this behavior.” Villafafia told\nOPR that she “could not seem to get [her supervisors] to understand the seriousness of Epstein’s\nbehavior and the fact that he was probably continuing to commit the behavior, and that there was\na need to move with <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> speed.” Nonetheless, Villafafia folloued the guidance of her\nimmediate supervisor and did not send the email.\n\nLike Lourie, Menchel told OPR that he believed meeting with defense counsel was good\npractice. Menchel told OPR that he saw “no dounside” to hearing the defense point of view.\nDefense counsel might make a persuasive point “that’s actually going to change our mind,” or\nalternatively, present arguments the defense would inevitably raise if the case went forward, and\nMenchel believed it would be to the USAO’s advantage to learn about such arguments in advance.\nMenchel also told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia ever articulating a concern that Epstein was\ncontinuing to offend, and in Menchel’s view, Epstein was “already under a microscope, at least in\nFlorida,” and it would have been “the height of stupidity” for Epstein to continue to offend in those\ncircumstances.\n\nE. June 2oo7: Villafaia Supplements the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nWhile Villafafia’s supervisors were considering whether to go forward with the proposed\ncharges, Villafafia took additional steps to support them. On June l4, 2oo7, she supplemented the\nprosecution memorandum with an addendum addressing “credibility concerns” relating to one of\nthe victims. In the email transmiting the addendum to Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her\nimmediate supervisor, Villafafia reported, “another Jane Doe has been identified and interviewed,”\nand the “different strategies” about hou to structure the charges left Villafafia unsure whether “to\nmake . . . changes nou or wait until we have received approval of the current charging strategy.”\nThe addendum itself related to a particular victim referred to as the minor who “saw Epstein most\nfrequently” and who had allegedly engaged in sexual activity with both Epstein and an Epstein\nassistant. In the addendum, Villafafia identified documents she had found corroborating four\nseparate statements made by this victim.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that the only victim about whom any supervisor ever articulated\nspecific credibility issues was the victim discussed in the addendum. Lourie told OPR that he had\nno specific recollection of the addendum, but it was “reasonable” to assume that the addendum\naddressed one particular victim because no one had identified specific concerns relating to any\nother victim. Villafafia’s immediate supervisor similarly told OPR that to her recollection, the\ndiscussions about credibility issues were generic rather than tied to specific victims.\n\nF. The June 26, 2oo7 Meeting with Defense Counsel\n\nMenchel agreed to meet with defense counsel on June 26, 2oo7, communicating directly\nwith Sanchez about the arrangements. At Menchel’s instruction, on June l8, 2oo7, Villafafia sent\na leter to defense counsel identifying what she described as “the statutes under consideration.”””!\n3 Villafafia sent copies of this leter to both Menchel and Sanchez. Villafafia told OPR that she objected to\nsending this information to the defense. Although Menchel did not recall directing Villafafia to send the leter to\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o7l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023089.tif": "understood that the PBPD would not have asked the FBI to investigate Epstein if the state had\npursued the appropriate charges. In other words, in Acosta’s view, “[T]his was, rightly or wrongly,\nan analysis that distinguished between what is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to prevent manifest injustice, versus what\nis the appropriate federal outcome to that.” Acosta told OPR that he believed he had discussed his\nconcerns about the case with Lourie, Sloman, or Menchel, although he could not recall any specific\nconversation with them.\n\nE. Villafafia Drafts a “Term Sheet” Listing the Requirements of a Potential\n\nAgreement with the Defense\n\nA meeting with defense counsel was scheduled for Tuesday, July 3l, 2oo7. Villafafia told\nOPR that between July 26 and July 3o, 2oo7, she had “some sort of discussion” with her\nsupervisors that resulted in her creation of a “term sheet” identifying the proposed terms for\nresolving the federal investigation through state charges. Sometime during that period, Villafafia\nleft a voicemail message for Menchel. During their OPR interviews, neither Villafafia nor\nMenchel could recall what Villafafia said in that message. On July 3o, 2oo7, Menchel emailed\nVillafafia:\n\nI received your voicemail this morning. I don’t see any reason to\nchange our approach. I think telling them that unless the state\nresolves this in a way that appropriately vindicates our interests and\nthe interests of the victims, we will seek [federal charges] conveys\nthat we are serious. While Lilly [Sanchez] has represented in the\npast that this would likely not happen, I never conveyed it in quite\nthese terms before. In any event, this is the course of action that the\nUS Atorney feels comfortable taking at this juncture.\n\nThe follouing day, July 3l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed a one-page “Terms of Epstein\nNon-Prosecution Agreement” to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie. Villafafia told OPR she had never\nbefore seen or heard of a non-prosecution agreement and that it was a concept “completely foreign”\nto her.®° Villafafia told OPR that the idea of styling the two-year state plea agreement with Epstein\nthe state indictment. OPR considered various potential state charges involving various numbers of victims and found\nno obvious reasonable state sentencing guidelines calculation that would have resulted in a two-year sentence.\n\n85 Deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements were standard, though infrequently used, vehicles for\nresolving certain federal criminal cases against corporate entities. A 2oo8 Departmental memorandum explained:\n\nThe terms “deferred prosecution agreement” and “non-prosecution agreement”\n\nhave often been used loosely by prosecutors, defense counsel, courts and\n\ncommentators. As the terms are used in these Principles [of Federal Prosecution\n\nof Business Organizations], a deferred prosecution agreement is typically\n\npredicated upon the filing of a formal charging document by the government, and\n\nthe agreement is filed with the appropriate court. In the non-prosecution\n\nagreement context, formal charges are not filed and the agreement is maintained\n\nby the parties rather than being filed with a court. Clear and consistent use of\n\nthese terms will enable the Department to more effectively identify and share best\n\npractices and to track the use of such agreements. These Principles do not apply\n\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o89\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023109.tif": "for them to be deported.”!!* As to whether the foreign nationals would be removable by virtue of\nhaving commited crimes, Villafafia told OPR she did not consider her role as seeking removal\napart from actual prosecution.\n\nVillafafia concluded her email to Lefkouitz by expressing disappointment that they were\nnot “closer to resolving this than it appears that we are,” and offering to meet the next day to work\non the agreement:\n\nCan I suggest that tomorrou we either meet live or via\n\nteleconference, either with your client or having him within a quick\n\nphone call, to hash out these items?

If you want to meet\n\n“off campus” somewhere, that is fine. I will make sure that I have\n\nall the <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> decision makers present or “on call,” as well.'!°\nVillafafia told OPR that she offered to meet Lefkouitz away from the USAO because conducting\nnegotiations via email was inefficient, and Villafafia wanted “to have a meeting where we sat doun\nand just finalized things. And what I meant by off campus is, sometimes people feel beter if you\ngo to a neutral location” for a face-to-face meeting.\n\nOn the morning of Monday, September l7, 2oo7, the USAO supervisor who was taking\nover Lourie’s duties as manager of the West Palm Beach office asked Villafafia for an update on\nthe plea negotiations, and she forwarded to him the email she had sent to Lefkouitz the previous\nafternoon. Villafafia told the manager, “As you can see... there are a number of things in their\nlast draft that were unacceptable. All of the loopholes that I sewed up they tried to open.”\n\nShortly thereafter, Villafafia alerted the new manager, Acosta, and Lourie that she had just\nspoken with Lefkouitz, who advised that Epstein was leaning touards a plea to state charges under\na non-prosecution agreement, and she would be forwarding to Lefkouitz “our last version of the\nNon-Prosecution Agreement.” Acosta asked that Villafafia “make sure they knou it[’]s only a\ndraft”? and reminded her that “(t]he form and language may need polishing.” Villafafia responded,\n“Absolutely. There were a lot of problems with their last atempt. They tried to re-open all the\nloopholes that I had sewn shut.” Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz the draft NPA that she had provided\nto Lefcourt on September ll, 2oo7, noting that it was the “last version” and would “avoid [him]\nhaving to reinvent the wheel.” She also updated the FBI case agents on the status of negotiations,\nnoting that she had told her “chain of command . . . that we are still on for the [September] 25th\n[to bring charges] . . . , no mater what.”\n\nAfter receiving the draft NPA, Lefkouitz asked Villafafia to provide for his review a factual\nproffer for a federal obstruction of justice charge, and, with respect to the NPA option, asked, “[I]f\nu4 According to the case agents, the West Palm Beach FBI office had an ICE agent working with them at the\nbeginning of the federal investigation, and the ICE agent normally would have looked into the immigration status of\nany foreign national, but neither case agent recalled any immigration issue regarding any of the Epstein employees.\nls Lefkouitz was based in New York City but traveled to Miami in connection with the case.\n\n7l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23lo9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023143.tif": "whether it is beter to have us partnered in the case or just serve a\nreview function) and he said he’d get back to me later today.\n\nOosterban told OPR that this email reflects that he likely told Acosta that he intended to\nlimit CEOS’s role to review only, and Acosta asked him to “make sure the defense is okay with\nthat,” to preempt a possible defense complaint about CEOS’s involvement in the review.\nOosterban explained to OPR that “the defense ke[pt] bringing up new arguments and new\nproblems and [the USAO was saying] look if we’re going to do this, if you’ve got a problem with\nit, tell us nou.”\n\nBy February 25, 2oo8, Lefkouitz told Oosterban, who informed Sloman, that the CEOS\nrole should be “review only.” Lourie had just then left the Department to enter private practice,\nand Oosterban continued to keep his direct supervisor, Deputy Assistant Atorney General\nMandelker, informed of the defense team contacts. Sloman emailed Lefkouitz that CEOS was\n“ready to proceed immediately” with a review of the mater. Sloman advised Lefkouitz that “in\nthe event CEOS decides that a federal prosecution should not be undertaken against Mr. Epstein,\nthis Office will close its investigation,” but that, “should CEOS disagree with Mr. Epstein’s\nposition, Mr. Epstein shall have one week to abide by [the NPA].” Sloman forwarded this email\nto Villafafia, who responded, ““Why would we possibly let him keep the same deal after all he has\nput us through? And after we have discovered 6 new girls... .”\n\nThe defense soon signaled that the CEOS review would not end Epstein’s requests for the\nDepartment’s involvement. On February 29, 2oo8, Lefkouitz requested a defense meeting with\nOosterban on March l2, 2oo8.'® Starr spoke to Assistant Atorney General Fisher and “made it\nclear that [the defense team would] want an audience with her if [CEOS] decid[ed] to support the\nprosecution.” On March 6, 2oo8, Acosta alerted Sloman and Oosterban that Starr and Lefkouitz\nhad called him to express “concern” about Oosterban’s participation in the case, and indicated\nthat “they may ask for more senior involvement.” Acosta “informed them that they certainly had\nthe right to ask whomever they wanted for whatever they thought appropriate, and that whatever\nprocess would be given them was up to whomever they asked.”\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz folloued up with Acosta in an email:\n\nWe appreciate that you will afford us as much time as Main Justice\n\ndetermines is appropriate for it to conduct a review of this mater.\n\nAs you have suggested, we will initiate that review process with\n\nDrew Oosterban, and engage in a discussion with him about all of\n\nthe facts and circumstances, as well as the legal and policy issues\n\nassociated with this case... .

In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts.

A comment to the rule clarifies that the factors\nrelevant to determining a lawyer’s competence to handle a particular mater include “the relative\ncomplexity and specialized nature of the mater, the lawyer’s general experience, the lawyer’s\ntraining and experience in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer is able to give\nthe mater, and whether it is feasible to refer the mater to, or associate or consult with, a lawyer\nof established competence in the field.” The comment further notes that “[i]n many instances the\nrequired proficiency is that of a general practitioner.” With respect to particular maters,\ncompetence requires inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem.\nThe comment to Rule 4-l.l explains that “[t]he required atention and preparation are determined\nin part by what is at stake; major litigation and complex transactions ordinarily require more\nextensive treatment than maters of lesser complexity and consequence.”\n2.

Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. II,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.”).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7°4 A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o3 See, e.g., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v.

As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” /d. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment).?°° The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l74\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023175.tif": "agreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.”\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §8§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o6 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l75\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023184.tif": "record, no restitution, no sex offender status, publication at a trial of\nthe names of certain victims that didn’t want their names revealed\nand the general difficulties of a trial for the victims and their\nfamilies.\n\nAlthough his emails shoued that, at the time, he advocated for prosecution of Epstein,\nLourie told OPR it was also his general recollection that “everybody at the USAO working on the\nmater had expressed concerns at various times about the long-term viability of a federal\nprosecution of Epstein due to certain factual and legal hurdles, as well as issues with the\ncooperation and desires of the victims.”\n\nSimilarly, Menchel—who had experience prosecuting sexual assault crimes—recalled\nunderstanding that many of the victims were unwilling to go forward and would have experienced\nadditional trauma as a result of a trial, and some had made statements exonerating Epstein.\nMenchel told OPR he believed that if the USAO had filed the proposed charges against Epstein,\nEpstein would have elected to go to trial. In Menchel’s view, the USAO therefore had to weigh\nthe risk of losing at trial, and thereby re-traumatizing the victims, against the benefits gained\nthrough a negotiated result, which ensured that Epstein served time in jail, registered as a sexual\noffender, and made restitution to his victims.\n\nSloman also recalled witness challenges and concerns about the viability of the\ngovernment’s legal theories. He told OPR:\n\n[I]t seemed to me you had a tranche of witnesses who were not going\nto be reliable. You had a tranche [of] witnesses who were going to\nbe severely impeached. People who loved Jeffrey Epstein who\nthought he was a Svengali . . . who were going to say I told him I\nwas l8 years old.\n\nYou had witnesses who were scared to death of the public light\nbeing shoun on them because their parents didn’t even knou -- had\nvery vulnerable victims. You had all of these concerns.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he recalled discussions with his senior managers about the victims’\ngeneral credibility and reluctance to testify and the evidentiary strength of the case, all of which\nfactored into the resolution. He acknouledged that his understanding of the facts was not\n“granular” and did not encompass a detailed understanding of each victim’s expected testimony,\nbut he trusted that his “team” had already “done the diligence <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>” to make\nrecommendations about the evidentiary strength of the case. Acosta recalled discussing the facts\nwith Sloman and Menchel, and possibly Lourie, none of whom had as detailed an understanding\nof the facts as Villafafia. Nevertheless, OPR credits Acosta’s statement that he reasonably\nbelieved, based on his conversations with others who expressed this view, that a trial would pose\nsignificant evidentiary challenges.\n\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony regarding witness challenges,\nincluding the FBI co-case agent, who recalled during his OPR interview that some of the victims\nhad expressed concern for their safety and “a lot of them d[id]n’t want to take the stand, and\n\nl46\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l84\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023197.tif": "The meeting of USAO representatives and Epstein’s defense atorneys, together with the\nState Atorney and the lead state prosecutor on September l2, 2oo7, was a <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> part of the\nNPA negotiation process.\n\nEven after the NPA was signed, the defense continued to request meetings and reviews of\nthe case, both within the USAO and by the Department’s Criminal Division and the Deputy\nAtorney General. Although limited reviews were granted, during this period there was only one\nsubstantive meeting with Acosta, on December l4, 2oo7.7°? This meeting occurred in lieu of the\nmeeting Starr had requested of Assistant Atorney General Fisher, most likely because the defense\nsubmissions to the Department’s Criminal Division had raised issues not previously raised with\nthe USAO and the Department determined that Acosta should address those in the first instance.”*°\nAcosta told OPR that he did not ask for the Department review, but he also did not want to appear\nas if he “fear[ed]” that review. Acosta’s nuanced position, houever, was not clear to the\nDepartment atorneys who responded to Epstein’s appeals and who perceived Acosta to be in favor\nof a Department review, rather than merely tolerant of it. Notably, though, none of those meetings\nor reviews resulted in the USAO abandoning the NPA, and Epstein gained no substantial\nadvantage from his continued entreaties.\n\nIn sum, in evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered the number of meetings, their\npurpose, the content of the discussions, and decisions made afterwards. OPR cannot say that the\nnumber of meetings, particularly those occurring before the NPA was signed, was so far outside\nthe norm—for a high profile case with skilled defense atorneys—that the quantity of meetings\nalone shous that the subjects were motivated by improper favoritism. In evaluating the subjects’\nconduct, OPR considered that the meetings were held with different levels of USAO managers and\nthat the explanations for the decisions to participate in the meetings reflected reasonable strategic\ngoals. Although OPR cannot rule out the possibility that because Acosta, Menchel, Lourie, or\nSloman knew or knew of the defense atorneys, they may have been willing to meet with them, it\nis also true that prosecutors routinely meet with defense atorneys, including those who are knoun\nto them and those who are not. Furthermore, meetings are more likely to occur in high profile\ncases involving defendants with the financial resources to hire skilled defense counsel who request\nmeetings at the highest levels of the USAO and the Department. Most significantly, OPR did not\nfind evidence supporting a conclusion that the meetings themselves resulted in any substantial\nbenefit to the defense. At each meeting, defense counsel strongly pressed the USAO—on factual,\nlegal, and policy grounds—to forgo its federal investigation and to return the mater to the state to\nproceed as it saw fit. The USAO never yielded on that point. Accordingly, OPR did not find\nevidence supporting a conclusion that Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia met with\ndefense counsel for the purpose of benefiting Epstein or that the meetings themselves caused\nAcosta or the other subjects to provide improper benefits to Epstein.\n\n232 Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz is discussed separately in the follouing section.\n233 Starr and other defense atorneys only obtained one meeting at the Department level, with Deputy Assistant\nAtorney General Mandelker and CEOS Chief Oosterban in March 2oo8. Although Starr requested a meeting with\nAssistant Atorney General Fisher and another with Deputy Atorney General Filip, those requests were not granted.\nl59\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l97\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023202.tif": "OPR asked Villafafia about these emails and about the tenor of her interactions with\nLefkouitz during the NPA negotiations and with other defense atorneys generally. Villafafia\nacknouledged that their tone was collegial and collaborative, and explained that generally, the\ntone of these emails reflected her personality and her commitment to complete the task her\nsupervisors had assigned to her:\n\n[I|f you were to pull all my e-mails on every case, you would find\nthat that is hou I communicate with people. I’m a Minnesota girl,\nand I prefer not to be confrontational until I have to be. And I can\nbe when I need to be. But my instructions from my supervisors were\nto engage in these negotiations and to complete them. So I felt that\ngiven that task, the best way to complete them was to reach the\nagreement and, keeping in mind the terms that . . . our office had\nagreed to, and do that in a way that is civil. So... although my\nlanguage in the kind of introductory or prefatory communications\nwith Mr. Lefkouitz was casual and was friendly, when you look at\nthe terms and when he would come back to me asking for changes,\nmy response was always, “No, I will not make that change.”\n\nVillafafia denied any intention to keep the victims uninformed about the NPA or to provide\nan improper benefit for Epstein, and she explained the context of the emails in question. The email\nin which Villafafia expressed reluctance to “highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and all\nof the other persons that we could charge” was writen in response to a defense proposal to include\nin the federal plea agreement the parties were then considering a promise by the government not\nto prosecute Epstein’s assistants and other employees. Lefkouitz had proposed that the plea\nagreement state, “Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also precludes the\ninitiation of any and all criminal charges which might otherwise in the future be brought against\n[four named female assistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity] for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” Villafafia told OPR that\nthe USAO was not intending to charge Epstein’s assistants and was not aware of anyone else who\ncould be charged, and thus did not oppose the request not to prosecute third parties. Houever,\nVillafafia was concerned that an overly detailed federal plea agreement would prompt the court to\nrequire the government to provide further information about the uncharged conduct, which might\nlead Epstein to claim the government breached the agreement by providing information to the\ncourt not directly connected to the charges to which he was pleading guilty. Villafafia was not the\nonly one to express concern about hou deeply a federal court might probe the facts, and whether\nsuch probing would interfere with the viability of a plea agreement. In an earlier email, Lourie\nhad suggested charging Epstein by complaint to allou the USAO more flexibility in plea\nnegotiations and avoid the problem that a court might not accept a plea to a conspiracy charge that\nrequired dismissal of numerous substantive counts.\n\nAs to Villafafia’s offer to meet with Lefkouitz “off campus” to resolve outstanding issues\nin the NPA negotiation, she explained to OPR that she believed a face-to-face meeting at a\n“neutral” location—with “all the <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> decision makers present or ‘on call’”— might facilitate\ncompletion of the negotiations, which had dragged on for some time.\n\nl64\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023208.tif": "successful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023212.tif": "The sexual offender registration provision is yet another example of hou Acosta’s decision\nto create an unorthodox mechanism that relied on state procedures to resolve the federal\ninvestigation led to unanticipated consequences benefiting Epstein. Acosta told OPR that one of\nthe core aspects of the NPA was the requirement that Epstein plead guilty to a state charge\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender. He cited it as a provision that he insisted on from the\nbeginning and from which he never wavered. Houever, the USAO failed to anticipate certain\nfactors that affected the sexual offender registration requirement in other states where Epstein had\naresidence. In selecting the conduct for the factual basis for the crime requiring sexual offender\nregistration, the state chose conduct involving a victim who was at least l6 at the time of her\ninteractions with Epstein, even though Epstein also had sexual contact with a l4-year old victim.\nThe victim’s age made a difference, as the age of consent in New Mexico, where Epstein had a\nresidence, was l6; therefore, Epstein was not required to register in that state. As a 2oo6 leter\nfrom defense counsel Lefcourt to the State Atorney’s Office made clear, the defense team had\nthoroughly researched the details and ramifications of Florida’s sexual offender registration\nrequirement; OPR did not find evidence indicating similar research and consideration by the\nUSAO.\n\nFinally, Acosta was well aware that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI’s atention\nbecause of a concern that the State Atorney’s Office had succumbed to “pressure” from defense\ncounsel. Villafafia told OPR that she informed both Acosta and Sloman of this when she met with\nthem at the start of the federal investigation. Although Acosta did not remember the meeting with\nVillafafia, he repeatedly told OPR during his interview that he was aware that the PBPD was\ndissatisfied with the State Atorney’s Office’s handling of the case. Shortly before the NPA was\nsigned, moreover, additional information came to light that suggested the State Atorney’s Office\nwas predisposed to manipulating the process in Epstein’s favor. Specifically, during the\nSeptember l2, 2oo7 meeting, at the state prosecutor’s suggestion, the USAO team agreed, with\nAcosta’s subsequent approval, to permit Epstein to plead guilty to one state charge of solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, rather than the three charges the USAO had originally\nspecified. The state prosecutor assured Lourie that the selected charge would require Epstein to\nregister as a sexual offender. Shortly thereafter, the USAO was told by defense counsel that despite\nthe assurances made to Lourie, the state prosecutor had advised Epstein—incorrectly, it turned\nout—that a plea to that particular offense would not require him to register as a sexual offender.\nYet, despite this evidence, which at least suggested that the state authorities should not have been\nconsidered to be a reliable partner in enforcing the NPA, Acosta did not alter his decision about\nproceeding with a process that depended completely on state authorities for its successful\nexecution.\n\nOPR finds that Acosta was reasonably aware of the facts and circumstances presented by\nthis case. He stated that he engaged in discussions about various aspects of the case with Sloman\nand Menchel, and relied upon them for their evaluation of the legal and evidentiary issues and for\ntheir assessment of trial issues. Acosta was copied on many substantive emails, reviewed and\nrevised drafts of the NPA, and approved the final agreement. Yet, rather than focusing on whether\nthe state’s prosecution was sufficient to satisfy the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, Acosta\nfocused on achieving the minimum outcome <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to satisfy the state’s interest, as defined in\npart by the state’s indictment, by using the threat of a federal prosecution to dictate the terms of\n\nl74\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023225.tif": "from Villafafia and others, but given the highly unusual procedure being considered, his decision\nshould have been made only after a full consideration of all of the possible ramifications and\nconsequences of pushing the mater into the state court system, with which neither Villafafia nor\nthe other subjects had experience, along with consideration of the legal and evidentiary issues and\npossible means of overcoming those issues. OPR did not find evidence indicating that such a\nmeeting or discussion with the full team was held before the decision was made to pursue the\nstate-based resolution, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term of incarceration, or\nbefore the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed. As Acosta later recognized and told OPR,\n“And a question that I think is a valid one in my mind is, did the focus on, let’s just get this done\nand get a jail term, mean that we didn’t take a step back and say, let’s evaluate hou this train is\nmoving?”\n\nMany features of the NPA were given inadequate consideration, including core provisions\nlike the term of incarceration and sexual offender registration, with the result that Epstein was able\nto manipulate the process to his benefit. Members of his senior staff held differing opinions about\nsome of the issues that Acosta felt were important and that factored into his decision-making.\nThere does not seem to be a point, houever, at which those differing opinions were considered\nwhen forming a strategy; rather, Acosta seems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him\nfolloued and atempted to implement but without a considered strategy beyond ataining the three\ncore elements. As the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had authority to proceed in this manner, but many of\nthe problems that developed with the NPA might have been avoided with a more thoughtful\napproach. As Acosta belatedly recognized, “[I]f I was advising a fellou U.S. Atorney today, I\nwould say, think it through.”\n\nNo one of the individual problems discussed above necessarily demonstrates poor\njudgment by itself. Houever, in combination, the evidence shous that the state-based resolution\nwas ill conceived from the start and that the NPA resulted from a flawed decision-making process.\nFrom the time the USAO opened its investigation, Acosta recognized the federal interest in\nprosecuting Epstein, yet after that investigation had run for more than a year, he set the\ninvestigation on a path not originally contemplated. Having done so, he had responsibility for\nensuring that he received and considered all of the <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> information before puting an end to\na federal investigation into serious criminal conduct. Acosta’s failure to adequately consider the\nfull ramifications of the NPA contributed to a process and ultimately a result that left not only the\nline AUSA and the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also caused victims and the public to question\nthe motives of the prosecutors and whether any reasonable measure of justice was achieved.\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he chose a course of\naction that was in marked contrast to the action that the Department would reasonably expect an\natorney exercising good judgment to take.\n\n259 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney acknouledged that “[t]he mater would have\nbenefited from more consistent staffing and atention.”\nl87\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23225\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023256.tif": "review the appropriateness of the potential federal charges and the government’s “unprecedentedly\nexpansive interpretation” of l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn a December l9, 2oo7 response to the defense team, Acosta offered to revise two\nparagraphs in the NPA to resolve “disagreements” with the defense and to clarify that the parties\nintended Epstein’s § 2255 liability to “place these identified victims in the same position as they\nwould have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial.

Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR that, while there were\nvalid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is\na case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required.

Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims\nIdentified in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea\nHearing\n\nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the\nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that\nthe federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state\ncharges. As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to\ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney. His decision that the\nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Atorney’s\njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view. Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim notification “to the discretion of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta recognized that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases. ‘79\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have recognized the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate notification would have\nincluded advising victims identified in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\n<span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility for victim notification\nentirely to the State Atorney’s discretion without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the identification of several victims who had not been identified by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the notification\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal notification obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such notification, he nonetheless left responsibility for such notification to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023310.tif": "argued that Acosta should have been able to rely on his staff to accomplish the victim notification\ntask, and thus had no responsibility to personally confirm that Chief Reiter would notify the\nvictims of the hearing.*”® Acosta is correct that under usual circumstances, USAO management\nplayed no role in the victim notification process; houever, in this case, the issue of victim\nnotification had been elevated from a rote administrative task to a major area of dispute with the\ndefense. Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim notification through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its significance to their oun cases.*”\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the\n428 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\n429 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo233lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023322.tif": "OPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework.

Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances.

At approximately 7:lo a.m., Epstein was transported by\nthe EMTs in an ambulance to New York Presbyterian Louer Manhatan Hospital, where he was pronounced\ndead by an emergency room physician at 7:36 a.m. On August ll, 2ol9, the Office of the Chief Medical\nExaminer, City of New York, performed an autopsy on Epstein and determined that the cause of death was\nhanging and the manner of death was suicide.\nThe OIG conducted this investigation jointly with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), with the OIG’s\ninvestigative focus being the conduct of BOP personnel.

Among the most significant was the\nfailure to assign Epstein a new cellmate on August 9, 2ol9, after Epstein’s cellmate was transferred out of\nMCC New York that day. Epstein was required to have a cellmate at all times pursuant to a writen direction\nthat the MCC New York Psychology Department issued on July 3o after Epstein was removed from suicide\nwatch and psychological observation follouing a possible atempted suicide by him on July 23. As a result of\nthe failure to assign him a new cellmate, Epstein was housed alone in his cell from the night of August 9\nuntil he was found hanged in his cell by SHU staff at approximately 6:3o a.m. the follouing morning. In\naddition, we determined that SHU staff failed to conduct required inmate counts and rounds, including\novernight on August 9-lo, and alloued Epstein to have an excess of blankets, linens, and clothing in his cell.\nThese failures compromised Epstein’s safety, the safety of other inmates, and the security of the institution,\nand provided Epstein an opportunity to commit suicide while locked alone in his cell on the morning of\nAugust lo without having been subject to overnight observation or supervision by SHU staff.\nThe OIG also found that an MCC New York supervisor had alloued Epstein, in violation of BOP policy, to\nmake an unrecorded, unmonitored telephone call the evening before his death to an individual with whom\nhe allegedly had a personal relationship. Further, 2 days before his death, during a meeting with his lawyers\nin a private room at the MCC New York, Epstein signed a new Last Will and Testament, which MCC New York\nofficials did not learn about until after his death.\nAdditionally, the OIG determined that MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU, including the two SHU staff\non duty the night of August 9-lo, 2ol9, who were stationed at a desk that was directly outside the SHU tier\nin which Epstein was housed and diagonally across from Epstein’s cell, had falsified BOP records to claim\nl Moving an inmate requiring outside emergency medical care to the Health Services Unit provides health care staff and\nEmergency Medical Technicians (EMT) with immediate access to any <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> medical equipment and supplies and\nallous EMTs faster access to the inmate when they arrive at MCC New York because Correctional Officers (CO) can\ndirectly escort EMTs to the Health Services Unit to begin emergency treatment immediately.

At all times, BOP employees must “[c]onduct themselves in a\nmanner that fosters respect for the Bureau of Prisons, the Department of Justice, and the U.S. Government.”\nBecause “[i]natention to duty in a correctional environment can result in escapes, assaults, and other\nincidents,” BOP employees “are required to remain fully alert and atentive during duty hours.” BOP policy\nprovides that employees can use government property for authorized purposes only, and further specifies\nthat personal use of government office equipment, such as computers, “will not take place during official\nworking hours.” BOP policy requires that employees “obey the orders of their superiors at all times.”\nB.

Special Housing Units\nSHUs within BOP facilities are governed by federal regulations, 28 C.F.R. 88 54l.2l-54l.33. These\nregulations provide that the BOP may establish SHUs “where inmates are securely separated from the\ngeneral inmate population.” These regulations and BOP policy (Program Statement 527o.ll, Special\nHousing Units) explain that inmates in the SHU are either on administrative detention or disciplinary\nsegregation status. Administrative segregation status is a non-punitive designation that removes an inmate\n“from the general population when <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to ensure the safety, security, and orderly operation of\ncorrectional facilities, or protect the public.” There are several reasons an inmate can be placed in\nadministrative detention status, including when an inmate's presence in the general inmate population\npresents a threat to self or others, or when administrative detention status is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for the protection of\nthe inmate. Assignment to the SHU for protection reasons can be based on being a victim of an assault,\nacting (or being perceived) as an informant, refusing to enter general population, or because of staff\nconcerns about the inmate's safety.\n° 5 C.F.R. § 2635.7o5(a); see also 5 C.F.R. § 2635.lol(b)(5).\nlo5 C.F.R. § 2635.lol(b)(9); see also 5 C.F.R. § 2635.7o4(a).\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23375\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023379.tif": "4. Suicide Response\nRecognizing that failure to appropriately respond to an emergency can jeopardize the safety of staff and\ninmates and the security of the institution, the BOP’s Standards of Employee Conduct require that\n“employees respond immediately, effectively, and appropriately during all emergency situations.” The MCC\nNew York General Housing Unit Post Orders outline the required response to a suspected inmate suicide.\nThese orders require that MCC New York staff notify the Operations Lieutenant and Control Center of the\nsituation. The orders further provide that, once there is adequate staff present, immediate action must be\ntaken to open the inmate's airway and initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation, even if MCC New York staff\nbelieve that the inmate “has been dead for a period of time.” MCC New York staff are to continue\ncardiopulmonary resuscitation until they are relieved by medical staff or another rescuer. The BOP policy\ngoverning crime scenes and the collection of evidence provides that the need to immediately atend to an\napparent suicide victim, undertake lifesaving measures, and ensure inmate and staff safety take precedence\nover efforts to preserve a crime scene.\"?\n5. Inmate Discipline\nFederal regulations, 28 C.F.R. 88 54l.l-54l.8, and BOP policy (Program Statement 527o.o9, Inmate Discipline\nProgram) establish an inmate discipline program, which is designed to ensure the safety, security, and\norderly operation of correctional facilities, as well as the protection of the public. The inmate discipline\nprogram applies to all inmates in BOP custody, including inmates with pending criminal charges. One of the\nguiding principles of this program is that BOP staff are to take disciplinary action when and to such a degree\nas <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to regulate the behavior of inmates to promote a safe and orderly institution. “Tatooing or\nself-mutilation” is among the prohibited acts sanctioned through the inmate discipline program. This\nprohibited act falls within the second most severe category of offenses on a 4-tier scale. The BOP defines\n“tatooing or self-mutilation” as “[t]o put indelible paterns on the skin; to injure, disfigure or make imperfect\nby removing or irreparably damaging parts of the body (wrist cuting falls within this offense).”\"* The\ndefinition does not make an explicit reference to suicide atempts other than inclusion of “wrist cuting.”\nAmong other things, BOP policy addressing the inmate discipline program identifies the prohibited acts,\ndescribes the process for adjudicating violations, and lists applicable penalties for each category of offense.\nAs relevant to this mater, the discipline process begins when a staff member observes an inmate commit a\nprohibited act and issues a report documenting the incident. A BOP supervisor then investigates the alleged\ninmate misconduct, which includes taking a statement from the inmate regarding the incident. If an inmate\nappears to be mentally ill at any stage of the disciplinary process, a mental health staff member will\nexamine the inmate and assess the inmate’s competency to participate in the disciplinary process. If the\ninmate is found to be competent and the prohibited act falls into the first or second most severe category,\nthe mater is referred to a discipline hearing officer, who will hold a hearing and make a determination as to\nwhether the inmate commited the prohibited act and, if so, impose any of the sanctions that correspond to\nthe severity of the prohibited act.

Epstein is Alloued to Make an Unmonitored Telephone Call on August 9\nFor safety and security reasons, BOP policy requires that all inmate telephone calls be made through the\nInmate Telephone System. BOP records reflect that Epstein placed an unrecorded, unmonitored telephone\ncall to a telephone number in the local 646 area code using a non-Inmate Telephone System line on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, from 6:58 p.m. to 7:l9 p.m. No other BOP records exist regarding the unmonitored call,\nincluding identity of the person called or a summary of the conversation. The OIG found no evidence that\nEpstein signed an Acknouledgement of Inmate form, as required by BOP policy and <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> for him to\nuse a non-Inmate Telephone System line. The Acknouledgement of Inmate form provides, among other\nthings, that the BOP reserves the authority to monitor and record non-atorney conversations on any\ntelephone located within the institution to preserve the security and orderly management of the institution\nand to protect the public. The OIG did not find that any notification was made to the MCC New York's\nSpecial Investigative Services staff advising the telephone call had been made, the date and time of the\ntelephone call, the name of the person being called, Epstein’s name and register number, or a brief\nstatement explaining the purpose of Epstein’s telephone call, as BOP policy requires.\nThe Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that when he was preparing to escort Epstein back\nto the SHU from the atorney conference room on August 9, 2ol9, a Unit Manager said to the Evening Watch\nOperations Lieutenant that he was going to escort Epstein, so he could provide Epstein with the opportunity\nto place a telephone call using an unrecorded legal telephone line that is utilized by inmates to call their\natorneys. The Unit Manager was the Institutional Duty Officer the week of Epstein’s death. The Northeast\nRegional Director told the OIG that an Institutional Duty Officer is a supervisor who monitors the facility on\nnon-duty hours on behalf of the Warden when the Warden is not present.\nThe Captain told the OIG that he had authorized the Unit Manager to provide Epstein with a telephone call\nfrom the SHU on August 9, 2ol9, because he wanted to accommodate Epstein’s request for a telephone call\nsince Epstein was assigned to the SHU and had limited ability to place telephone calls. The Captain\nexplained that when the Unit Manager was escorting Epstein from his atorney visit back to the SHU, he told\nthe Unit Manager in the elevator that Epstein could place a telephone call from the SHU, but it had to be\nmonitored and logged.\nThe Unit Manager told the OIG that he worked on August 9 from approximately ll a.m. to 7 p.m. The Unit\nManager explained that on August 9, Epstein asked to call his mother and that it was his understanding that\nEpstein had not been able to obtain the <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> documentation to use the Inmate Telephone System for\nvarious reasons, including the fact that Epstein was with his atorneys during normal working hours. As\ndescribed belou, Epstein had, in fact, completed the requisite BOP paperwork that alloued him to place\ncalls through the Inmate Telephone System. The Unit Manager said the decision to allou Epstein to place\nthe call was his alone as the Unit Manager and because, as the Institutional Duty Officer, he was\nrepresenting the Warden, who was not physically within MCC New York at that time. The Unit Manager said\nhe did not recall having a conversation with the Captain about permiting Epstein to make the call, and he\nwould have alloued the call even if the Captain did not want him to, given it was his decision to make as the\nUnit Manager. The Unit Manager explained that he viewed ensuring that inmates had family socialization as\n\n58\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23425\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023427.tif": "telephone call, Epstein told Individual l that the press had goten crazy, and they discussed personal things\nsuch as books, music, and hygiene while incarcerated.

He told Individual l he loved her, to be strong, and that he would not be\nable to call her again for another month.\nSenior Officer Specialist l told the OIG that he was not a witness to Epstein’s August 9 call, but he had\npreviously discussed telephone calls with Epstein and knew that Epstein had the requisite paperwork that\nalloued him to place calls through the Inmate Telephone System. Senior Officer Specialist l told the OIG\nthat Epstein was issued the <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> documentation to make telephone calls when Inmate l was his\ncellmate. Senior Officer Specialist l also advised the OIG about an interaction that he had with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys prior to August 9 when he was on an elevator with Epstein and the atorney. According\nto Senior Officer Specialist l, Epstein’s atorney asked him about geting Epstein the <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>\ndocumentation to make calls. Senior Officer Specialist l said he then verified that Epstein was able to make\ncalls through the Inmate Telephone System. When Senior Officer Specialist l asked Epstein why he had said\nhe was unable to make calls, Epstein responded, “[T]hey said they monitor those phone calls.” Senior\nOfficer Specialist l said that in a subsequent conversation with Epstein’s atorney, the atorney asked hou\nEpstein could get an unmonitored call. Senior Officer Specialist l told Epstein’s atorney that decision had to\nbe made by a Lieutenant or Unit Manager.\nNoel told the OIG that after Epstein’s atorney conference on August 9, the Unit Manager plugged a\ntelephone line in the legal line, and placed Epstein in a shouer area within the SHU where he was afforded a\ntelephone call. The OIG investigation determined that the legal line is an unrecorded telephone line outside\nof the Inmate Telephone System, which is designed for inmates to use when speaking with their counsel and\ntherefore is not recorded. Noel said that after the Unit Manager set Epstein up with the call, he left the SHU\nand did not instruct Noel, or anyone else to Noel’s knouledge, to monitor Epstein’s call. According to Noel,\nthe call was not monitored or logged. Noel said that approximately l5 to 2o minutes later, while Epstein\nwas still using the telephone, the Unit Manager called the SHU staff via telephone, told Noel that Epstein’s\ntime was up, and asked that Noel retrieve the telephone from Epstein. Noel estimated that Epstein’s call\nlasted for 2o minutes and said the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the Material Handler were also\npresent in the SHU during Epstein’s phone call. Noel reported that she took the phone back from Epstein,\nleft Epstein alone in the shouer, and went to use the bathroom on lo South. Noel said that upon her\nreturn, Epstein was already placed back in his cell.\nThe Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he was present in the SHU on August 9 during\nthe time of Epstein’s telephone call but did not overhear Epstein’s conversation. The Evening Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge also said that while Epstein was having his telephone call, the officers were distracted by\nthe actions of another inmate. The Material Handler said he did not recall seeing the Unit Manager or\nEpstein in the shouer area on the night of August 9, and did not have any knouledge or information\nregarding a phone call made by Epstein that night.\nThe Northeast Regional Director told the OIG that if Epstein’s call was authorized by an MCC New York\nofficial, then it should have been done on a speaker phone while being monitored by a staff member, and\nthe call should have been logged and a record of the call should have been created. The Northeast Regional\nDirector said Epstein’s unmonitored telephone call was extremely concerning because “[w]e don’t knou\n\n6o\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23427\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023429.tif": "result, many SHU staff and supervisors were unaware that Epstein did not have a cellmate as the Psychology\nDepartment had determined was <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>, and Epstein was alone and unobserved in his cell for an\nextended period of time.\nl. The 4 p.m. SHU Count on August 9\nThe OIG’s investigation determined that the 4 p.m. SHU inmate count on August 9, 2ol9, was inaccurate\nbecause SHU staff did not physically count the inmates as required by BOP policy and instead relied upon a\npredetermined number of inmates believed to be in the SHU at that time. Houever, Epstein, who was in the\nSHU atorney visitation room, was correctly accounted for during the 4 p.m. and subsequent SHU counts.\nThe OIG determined that the error in the 4 p.m. SHU count was carried over into the next inmate count at\nlo p.m. that counted an inmate who had been transferred out of the SHU. The SHU inmate count was not\ncorrected until l2 a.m. when the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant reviewed the master institutional\ncount and housing unit count slips and informed SHU staff of the correct number of inmates in the SHU at\nthat time.\nSenior Officer Specialist 5 told the OIG that prior to his departure from the SHU at approximately 4 p.m., he\ntold the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge what the SHU count should be. In addition, the Day Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that SHU staff maintain a “cheat sheet,” which lists the number of\ninmates believed to be in the SHU at any given time.\nWhen interviewed by the OIG, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge reviewed the 4 p.m. SHU count slip from\nAugust 9, 2ol9, which was signed by the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and CO Noel. Based on his\nreview, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and\nNoel probably did not count the inmates in the SHU. He said they likely wrote doun the numbers they\nthought should have been entered for the count because the count slip inaccurately included an inmate\n(Inmate 4) among the number of inmates in the SHU after that inmate had been transferred to another\nhousing unit. According to what he told the OIG and wrote in an email on August 9, earlier that afternoon\nthe Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge observed Inmate 4 atempt to retrieve an unknoun item from his\nvisitor in the MCC New York SHU visiting room. The Lieutenant’s Log from August 9, 2ol9, reflected that\nfollouing this incident, Inmate 4 was removed from the SHU at 3:l5 p.m. and transferred to the Receiving\nand Discharge dry cell, which is a secure location where inmates are taken for observation when they are\nbelieved to have ingested or secreted contraband on their person. According to the Day Watch SHU Officer\nin Charge, the inaccurate 4 p.m. count slip told him “that the count was not done and they just assumed and\nwent by the cheat sheet because the body wasn't even there,” referring to Inmate 4, who was transferred\nfrom the SHU to Receiving and Discharge. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that if the\n4 p.m. SHU count had been accurately conducted, then the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the\nSHU staff should have realized that Inmate 4 was no longer in the SHU.\nIn his interview with the OIG, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge acknouledged that neither he nor\nany other SHU staff member conducted the 4 p.m. SHU count on August 9. The Evening Watch SHU Officer\nin Charge verified that it was his handwriting and signature on the 4 p.m. SHU count slip and said he had\nprepared the count slip ahead of time because “[t]here was so much going on” in the SHU that day.

Noel said she observed Thomas lifting Epstein from under his\narms and dragging him back out of the corner of the cell and laid him doun on the ground to perform CPR.\nAccording to Noel, within seconds of Thomas calling out for the cuter she hit the body alarm, which is a\nbuton on an MCC staff member's radio that is used to signal distress or an emergency. Noel recalled\nhearing Thomas say, “Breathe, Epstein, breathe,” and “We're going to be in so much trouble.” Noel said she\nstood at the door about a foot away from Epstein’s cell and never went in. Noel said Thomas only\nperformed chest compressions and said she did not see Thomas checking for breath or pulse. Noel said\nthat when she saw Epstein, he looked blue and did not have a shirt on or anything around his neck. Noel\nsaid she did not get the cuter because Thomas did not need it based upon the ripping sound she heard.\nNoel said an MCC New York Lieutenant who responded to the alarm asked her what happened, and before\nshe got the chance to answer, Thomas stated, “Oh, it's not her fault, we fucked up.” Noel did not recall\nmaking any comments or statements to the Lieutenant. Other than the Lieutenant, Noel did not recall\nwhich COs responded to the alarm and she did not knou what happened in the cell after MCC New York\nstaff arrived because she was waiting at the botom of the steps outside the L Tier. Noel said she was alone\nin the SHU for 2o minutes after they left with Epstein and she kept calling the Control Center to get\nstatus updates.\nNoel told the OIG that Epstein’s cell was approximately l5 feet from the SHU Officers’ Station. Noel said she\nwould have knoun if someone went in or out of Epstein’s cell overnight and no one did.

Noel said that when she is seen on the camera at the desk not\nmoving, she was on the computer. Noel then clarified by saying that she worked 5 days of overtime leading\nup to her shift, so she would begin to doze off; houever, she caught herself and never slept.\nThe Lieutenant told the OIG that he was the Operations Lieutenant who relieved the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant on August lo, 2ol9, at approximately 5:3o a.m. The Lieutenant said that at\napproximately 6:33 a.m., he heard a call for a medical emergency in the SHU and immediately responded to\nthe alarm. When he arrived, Noel told him, “Epstein hung himself.” Once inside, the Lieutenant observed\nthat Thomas was performing CPR on Epstein. The Lieutenant stated that he asked, “Where's his bunkie at?”\nand that Noel responded, in substance, that Epstein did not have a cellmate. Noel also told the Lieutenant,\n“We didn’t do rounds at 3 a.m. and 5 a.m.” Thomas stated, “We didn’t do the rounds. We messed up.” The\nLieutenant took over administering CPR and asked SHU staff to retrieve an AED and call for the duty nurse.\nThe MCC New York Electronics Technician told the OIG that he responded to the emergency call at 6:33 a.m.\nWhen the Electronics Technician first arrived in the SHU, Thomas and other MCC New York staff members\nwere picking Epstein up and placing him on a stretcher.

Thus, anyone entering or\natempting to enter the L Tier from the common area of the SHU on August 9 and lo would have been\npicked up by the video recorded by that camera. Epstein’s cell door, houever, was not in that camera’s field\nof view. The other camera that was recording was located in one of the ninth floor’s two elevator bays and\nprovided video of the ninth-floor fire exit and two of the floor’s four elevators.\nThe available video shoued that at approximately 7:49 p.m. on August 9, Epstein was escorted touard the\nL Tier stairway by an individual believed to be the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge.

Between approximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9 and just before 6:3o a.m. on\nAugust lo, the OIG did not observe on the recorded video any CO or other individual enter any of the SHU\ntiers, which is consistent with CO Tova Noel and Material Handler Michael Thomas's admissions to the OIG\nthat the SHU rounds and counts were not conducted during that time frame.

The failure to undertake\nthese required measures to account for inmate whereabouts and wellbeing—and the supervisors’ failure to\nproperly supervise the SHU staff, as discussed further belou—resulted in Epstein being unobserved for\nhours before his death, which compounded the failure of MCC New York staff to ensure that Epstein had an\nappropriate cellmate.\nl. Failure to Conduct Rounds and Inmate Counts in the SHU\nFederal regulations require that employees “use official time in an honest effort to perform official duties.””!\nAdditionally, BOP standards of conduct required that employees “[c]onduct themselves in a manner that\nfosters respect for the Bureau of Prisons, the Department of Justice, and the U.S. Government.””* Because\n“[i]Jnatention to duty in a correctional environment can result in escapes, assaults, and other incidents,”\nBOP standards of conduct also require employees “to remain fully alert and atentive during duty hours.”\nBOP policy also requires “[c]ontinuous inmate accountability,” which is accomplished through rounds and\ninmate counts.’”? Among other things, rounds and inmate counts enable staff to observe inmates and\nensure that they are safe and secure in their cells and are in good health.\nBOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders set out the requirements for these inmate accountability\nmeasures, specifying that correctional staff must conduct rounds on an irregular schedule at least twice\neach hour, no more than 4o minutes apart. BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders further specify\nthat at least two MCC New York SHU staff members must conduct inmate counts at l2 a.m., 3.a.m.,5a.m.,\n4 p.m., and lo p.m. daily, and also at lo a.m. on weekends and federal holidays.\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed that an inmate (Inmate 4) was internally transferred from the\nSHU to Receiving and Discharge at approximately 3:l5 p.m. on August 9, 2ol9; houever, this inmate transfer\nwas not documented until approximately l2:35 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9. Based on this internal transfer,\nBOP records, and witness statements, the OIG determined that the 4 p.m. and lo p.m. SHU inmate counts\non August 9 were erroneous. In addition, the OIG reviewed the available SHU security camera video, which\ndid not shou COs walking up or doun the stairs leading to the various SHU tiers during the count times, a\nprocess that is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to conduct an accurate count of inmates.”* During their OIG interviews, the\nEvening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Material Handler, CO Tova Noel, and Material Handler Michael\nThomas each admited that they did not conduct all of the mandatory rounds and inmate counts in the SHU\n™ 5 C.F.R. § 2635.7o5(a); see also 5 C.F.R. 8 2635.lol(b)(5).\n7 BOP Program Statement 342o.ll.\n® BOP Program Statement 55oo.l4.\n™ As discussed in Chapter 5, the OIG found that the security camera video was of lou quality.

MCC New York Staff Failed to Conduct and Document Cell Searches and Eliminate\n\nSafety Hazards in Epstein’s Cell on August 9 Leaving Epstein with Excessive Linens\nin His Cell\nThe OIG’s investigation and review determined that MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU on August 9,\n2ol9, failed to conduct and document searches of Epstein’s cell in the SHU. BOP policy requires that BOP\nstaff routinely and irregularly search housing units.2° MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that SHU staff\nconduct at least five cell searches each shift during daytime and evening hours (7:45 a.m. to l2 a.m.), in\naddition to other searches of SHU cells and common areas, and BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post\nOrders require writen documentation of cell searches. BOP policy explains that the purpose of cell\nsearches is to, among other things, maintain sanitary conditions and eliminate safety hazards. To that end,\nMCC New York General Housing Unit Post Orders provide that when an inmate is transferred out of a\nfacility, all of the inmate's linens should be taken to Receiving and Discharge.\nThe OIG reviewed MCC New York SHU TRUSCOPE entries for August 9, and identified only one cell search\nentered by MCC New York SHU staff for the entire day. During his interview with the OIG, the Day Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge stated that multiple cell searches were conducted in the MCC New York SHU on\nAugust 9; houever, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge stated that he failed to document the cell searches\nwithin the TRUSCOPE system as required because he was too busy with other duties.

The BOP should continue to develop and implement plans to address staffing\n\nshortages at its prisons.\nSince at least 2ol5, the OIG has repeatedly found the need for BOP to address staffing shortages, including\nmedical staffing shortages.® This investigation and review revealed the direct impact of staffing deficiencies\non inmate safety. For example, the Material Handler worked three consecutive shifts—24 hours straight—\non August 9, 2ol9, which was certainly a contributory cause to the lack of adequate means of accounting for\ninmate location and wellbeing in the SHU. The Material Handler told the OIG that no one did the lo p.m.\nSHU inmate count because they were tired. Additionally, the OIG’s investigation and review found that in\nconnection with MCC New York's upgrade of its security camera system, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office\narranged for technicians from other BOP institutions to perform temporary duty (TDY) assignments to MCC\nNew York to perform <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and wiring work. Yet, during the course of\nthe TDY rotations, work was not consistently conducted on the camera upgrade because sometimes TDY\nstaff were used to cover shortages at MCC New York's custody posts. Without adequate staffing, the BOP\ncannot fulfill its mandate to ensure safe and secure correctional facilities. The OIG therefore recommends\nthat the BOP continue to develop and implement plans to address staffing shortages at its institutions.\n\n7. The BOP should evaluate its cell search procedures and make changes as may be\n\nappropriate to improve those procedures through policy, training, or other measures.\nThe OIG’s investigation and review found that there was an excessive amount of linens in Epstein’s cell at\nthe time of his death. BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that SHU cells be searched,\nbut they do not specifically address the issue of excessive bed linens, which the Captain told the OIG\npresent a safety hazard because an inmate can use them to harm themselves or escape from the\ninstitution. Therefore, the OIG recommends that the BOP evaluate its cell search procedures and make\nchanges as may be appropriate to improve those procedures through policy, training, or other measures.\n® U.S. DOJ OIG, Analysis of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Fiscal Year 2ol9 Overtime Hours and Costs, Management Advisory\nMemorandum 2l-oll (December 2o2o); U.S. DOJ OIG, Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Use of Restrictive Housing\nfor Inmates with Mental Illness, Evaluation and Inspections Division Report l7-o5 (July 2ol7); U.S. DOJ OIG, Audit of the\nFederal Bureau of Prisons' Contract No. DJBPOo6l6BPAl2oo4 Awarded to Spectrum Services, Inc., Victorville, California, Audit\nDivision Report l7-2o (March 2ol7); U.S. DOJ OIG, Audit of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Contract with CoreCivic, Inc. to\nOperate the Adams County Correctional Center in Natchez, Mississippi, Audit Division Report l7-o8 (December 2ol6); U.S.\nDOJ OIG, Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons' Medical Staffing Challenges, Evaluation and Inspections Division Report\nl6-o2 (March 2ol6); U.S. DOJ OIG, Review of the Impact of an Aging Inmate Population on the Federal Bureau of Prisons,\nEvaluation and Inspections Division Report l5-o5 (May 2ol5).

The OIG requests that the BOP provide an update on the status of its response\nto the recommendations within 9o days of the issuance of this report.\nRecommendation l: The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate follouing suicide\nwatch or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or\nsecurity considerations.\nStatus: Resolved.\nBOP Response: The BOP reported the follouing:\n\nThe BOP recognizes the importance of careful monitoring of adults in custody who face mental\n\nhealth challenges and therefore concurs with this recommendation. Our practice is to\n\ncarefully consider both the well-being and safety of the individual involved and overarching\n\nsafety and security concerns. In the years since Mr. Epstein’s death, the BOP has updated its\n\nprocess related to suicide watch and psychological observation. Under BOP's revised process,\n\nupon removal from suicide watch or psychological observation, psychologists make\n\nindividualized care recommendations about clinical follou-up and other custodial concerns,\n\nincluding housing and cellmates. Mental health, custody, and unit team employees work\n\ncollaboratively to ensure that each individual removed from suicide watch is housed\n\nappropriately.\nOIG Analysis: The BOP’s response is responsive to this recommendation. The OIG will consider whether to\nclose this recommendation after the BOP (l) provides for the OIG's review a proposed process for assigning\na cellmate follouing suicide watch or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the\nparticular individual or security considerations, that addresses issues identified in the OIG’s report; and (2)\nimplements the process.\nRecommendation 2: The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for suicide\nand for whom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the\nrecommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan for cellmate re-\nassignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or security\nconsiderations.\nStatus: Resolved.\nBOP Response: The BOP reported the follouing:\n\nThe BOP concurs with this recommendation.

Similarly, atorneys may not fax documents to inmates\nor to MCC New York staff for delivery to inmates.\n2. Inmates Telephone System (ITS)\nThe Bureau of Prisons extends telephone privileges to inmates as\npart of its overall correctional management strategy. See 28\nC.F.R. $54o.loo, et seg., Subpart I - Telephone Regulations for\nInmate; and Program Statement 5264.o7, Telephone Regulations for\nInmates. Telephone privileges are a supplemental means of\nMaintaining community and family ties that may contribute to an\ninmate's personal development. An inmate may request to call a\nperson of his or her choice outside the institution on a\ntelephone provided for that purpose. Houever, limitations and\nconditions may be imposed upon an inmate's telephone privileges\nto ensure adherence to other aspects of the Bureau's correctional\nINManagement responsibilities. In addition to the procedures set\nforth in this subpart, inmate telephone use is subject to those\nlimitations which the Warden determines are <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to ensure\nthe security or good order, including discipline, of the\ninstitution or to protect the public. Restrictions on inmate\ntelephone use may also be imposed as a disciplinary sanction.\nSee 28 C.F.R. Part 54l.\nInmates must submit a list of numbers they wish to be placed on\ntheir approved telephone list. Inmates can only call numbers\nplaced on their approved telephone list. Once an inmate submits\nthe initial list, it will be processed as soon as possible.\nInmates may submit additional telephone numbers once they are\nassigned a Correctional Counselor or Case Manager from the Unit\nTeam.\nInmates are advised of the institution’s telephone monitoring\ncapability. See 28 C.F.R. $54o,lo2. A notice is posted next to\neach inmate telephone advising that calls are monitored.\nOrdinarily, calls are paid for by the inmate, but in some cases\nthe receiving party pays. See 28 C.F.R. §54o.lo5. Third party,\nconference calls or use of two phones on the same number, or\nother alternative call arrangements are not permited, thus\nlimiting the opportunity for inmates to use the phones for\ncriminal or other inappropriate purposes. Inmates who use the\ntelephone improperly are subject to disciplinary actions which\nmay result in the loss of telephone privileges, and in some cases\ncriminal charges.\nInmates may place atorneys on their approved telephone list.\nHouever, the calls are recorded and subject to monitoring. Such\ncalls are not atorney-client privileged calls. Inmates seeking\natorney-client privileged calls must request an unmonitored\ntelephone call as described above in section B{l).\nPage ll of 22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23754\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023762.tif": "Court Ordered Studies\nAt anytime during an inmate’s pre-trial confinement, the judge\nmay order one of numerous studies found at l8 U.S.C. $424l et\nseq.

If an inmate has a verified chronic\ncondition (i.e. diabetes, hypertension, etc.) he will be placed\nin a chronic care clinic and scheduled for appointments\nautomatically.\nSick call slips are available on the housing units and there is a\nsick call box on each unit in which to submit the slips. The\nsick call box on each housing unit will he emptied daily by a\nmember of Health Services Staff and given to the medical staff\nfor triage. Requests will be prioritized in accordance with\ngreatest medical need. Inmates will be charged a $2.oo co-pay\nfee for all non-chronic care, non-emergent appointments.\n\n2. Emergency Care\nAny time there is a medical emergency on a unit, the inmate\nshould notify the unit officer who can call the on-duty P.A.\n\n3.

The procedures outlined belou\nhave been in effect since the aforementioned date. This memorandum is being resubmited as revisions\nhave been made since this period of time and updated signatures are <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>.\nl. PURPOSE: To establish procedures at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC),\nNew York with regard to inmates placed on Psychological Observation status.\n2) DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a\nmental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental\nstatus), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate\nis no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general\npopulation or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological\nobservation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal\n(e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to\nhis/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping,\ndisorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable.\nPsychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until\nsuch time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in\ngeneral population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an\ninpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.\n3. PROCEDURES: The follouing are the guidelines for a Psychological Observation:\nA. Only a member from the Psychology Services Department may place and remove an\ninmate from Psychological Observation status as only a psychologist can determine if an\ninmate is at elevated risk for suicide or not. Upon placement or removal of Psychological |\nObservation, the Psychologist will notify the Operations Lieutenant, Health Services Staff\n(i.e., Physician Assistants, Health Services Administrator, and Clinical Director), Food\nService Administrator, and Duty Officer.\nB. Psychological Observations will be conducted in the suicide watch area or when not\nfeasible due to space limitations, one of the designated suicide watch cells in SHU.

This grief may be secondary to the\nloss of former lifestyle, loss of physical items or collections related to sexual offenses, and/or the\nloss of perceived relationships with victims.

Houever, the\nsign-in sheets for this training are nou be examined by the SHU Lieutenant for accuracy. If a staff member who is\nassigned to SHU misses the training, the sign-in sheet will be routed to the Captain, who will coordinate with the\nChief Psychologist and schedule a time to receive a make-up session for the SHU Suicide Prevention Training.\nSHU training is conducted quarterly two weeks from the beginning of the new quarter. A representative from\nPsychology will provide the required suicide prevention training. In addition, the SHU training on BOPLEARN will\nbe completed by all staff assigned to SHU that day of training. SHU staff will be alloted time during that day to\ncomplete all prescribed web-based training as identified on the agenda. Staff who are assigned to SHU but have not\nreceived the mandatory training before assuming the post will be roster-adjusted to atend another training day as\nassigned by the Captain.\nStaff assigned to suicide watch shall maintain a chronological log of the inmate’s behavior.

A chronological record of events will commence\nimmediately upon the initiation of watch, It is the responsibility of the staff member initiating the watch to obtain a\nblank log book prior to initiating the watch. Different log books will be used for each inmate on suicide watch; each\nlog book will contain entries for one suicide watch only. The name and register number of the inmate on watch shall\nbe clearly printed on the front cover of the log book and at the top of each page in the log book in which entries are\nmade.\nDuring some suicide watches, staff observers may cover some shifts and inmate companions may cover others. In\nthis instance, two separate log books must be used: one for the shifts during which staff are maintaining constant\nvisual observation (blue) and another for shifts during which inmate companions are providing constant visual\nobservation (yellou). When separate inmate companion log books are used, staff must sign the inmate companion\nlog book every 6o minutes.\nLights will remain on inside the cell 24 hours day to ensure the inmate on watch can be seen. A Lieutenant will\nmake rounds every shift and remove the inmate from the cell and perform a cursory search. No food items, trays,\neating utensils, milk cartons, toilet paper, plastic bags, reading materials, pens, pencils, or anything else not\nprescribed by Psychology staff should be in the cell.\nThe inmate will be outfited in a suicide preventive smock, suicide preventive blanket, suicide preventive matress.\nand if <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> a suicide preventive helmet. Inmate Companions will be searched prior to assuming duties. Inmate\nCompanions are not alloued to have radios, mp3 players, magazines, books or anything that would distract them\nfrom maintaining constant supervision. Inmate Companions will not have direct or physical contact with inmates on\nsuicide watch.\nl2. Staffing: The Drug Abuse Program Coordinator positon at MCC New York was abolished during Phase I of the\nstaff realignment during fiscal year 2ol8.

James C. Wills,\nformer Acting Assistant Director, Reentry Services Division, appointed a team to conduct a\npsychological reconstruction.

This\nreconstruction was established in accordance with Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) Program Statement\n5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program.\n\nSocial History: Mr. Epstein did not have a Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) available at the time of\nthe reconstruction; therefore, no official information regarding social history was accessible.\n\nThe follouing was gathered from publicly available documents. Mr. Epstein was born in l953\nand grew up in a middle-class family in the neighborhood of Sea Gate on Coney Island,\nBrooklyn, New York, with one brother. After early promotion in two grades, Mr. Epstein\ngraduated from Lafayete High School in l969, at the age of l6. He atended Cooper Union and\nNew York University but did not graduate from either. Mr. Epstein taught at the Dalton School,\na private school on the Upper East Side of Manhatan from September l974 until he was\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooo252l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00025220.jpg": "Page 976\nInstitutional History: On July 6, 2ol9, Mr. Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in\nNew Jersey upon his return from Paris, France. It is unknoun whether he was anticipating this\narrest. He was transported to MCC New York and keyed into SENTRY at 9:24 p.m. that\nevening. Mr. Epstein was placed in a general population housing unit for approximately 22\nhours. On July 7, 2ol9, at approximately 7:2o p.m. he was moved to the Special Housing Unit\n(SHU) pending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness\nof his notoriety among the inmate population.\nWith regard to his adjustment to a correctional seting, Mr. Epstein received one incident report\nwhile in BOP custody for Self-Mutilation on July 23, 2ol9. As of August l5, 2ol9, the incident\nreport had been expunged though it is unclear why it had been expunged and whether\nMr. Epstein knew this. Also, a review of financial transactions associated with Mr. Epstein’s\nprison account revealed one of his atorneys was depositing funds into his cellmate’s (inmate\nReyes) commissary account for unknoun reasons.\nHEALTH CARE AND PERSONALITY DESCRIPTION\nBOP Electronic Medical Records (BEMR) indicate Mr. Epstein was diagnosed with\nhyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, hypertension, constipation, prediabetes, neuralgia, and neuritis\nunspecified. He was prescribed the follouing mediations: docusate sodium, milk of magnesia,\nomega 3, methylprednisone, and bisacodyl. Mr. Epstein was also prescribed insulin, and the\nprescription required him to go to the institution pharmacy for administration of this medication.\nHouever, the dates for which it was prescribed have a notation indicating “dose not indicated,”\nthus it does not appear insulin was routinely medically <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>. The rest of the medications\nprescribed were self-carry. He also had a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine\nwhich is typically used to treat sleep apnea. Mr. Epstein was provided with his personal CPAP\nmachine on July 3o, 2ol9, per BEMR.\nIn regard to mental health history and treatment, there are no knoun available records. Any\nrecords that may have been maintained relating to Mr. Epstein’s incarceration in Florida were\nnot available for review as of the date of this report. With regard to Psychology Data System\nrecords in BEMR (PDS-BEMR)E™ \"Forensic Psychologist at\nMCC New York completed a routine Intake Screening on July 8, 2ol9.

The need for a cellmate was communicated between Day Watch\n(DW) and Evening Watch (EW) shifts in the SHU, but no cellmate was placed with him by the\nEW staff. According to a memorandum from Senior Officer ie, ee\nstaff were informed at approximately l:5o p.m. that Mr. Epstein’s cellmaf would likely not\nreturn from court. Furthermore, Officers\" hoted Mr. Epstein would need a cellmate upon\narrival from his atorney visit.\n\nA review of the 3o-minute rounds forms indicate unit rounds were completed for the entire MW\nshift on August lo. 2ol9.

According to the Report\nof Incident, on August lo, 2ol9, at approximately 6:33 a.m., while serving the breakfast meal in\nthe SHU, Range 9 South, Mr. Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell.

Cardiopulmonary\nresuscitation (CPR) reportedly continued while the AED was placed on Mr. Epstein. The AED\nreportedly indicated no shock advised and CPR was continued. Mr. Epstein was escorted to\nHealth Services at approximately 6:39 a.m., and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) arrived at\n6:43 a.m. He was transported to the local hospital at approximately 7:lo a.m. Mr. Epstein was\npronounced deceased at 7:36 am. It was not possible to confirm this timeline without viewing\nvideo footage.\nCONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS_\nA general appreciation of risk factors for suicide specific to sex offenders is <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> when\nreviewing Mr. Epstein’s death. These factors, as well as more general risk factors for suicide,\nwere likely present. There are several common factors that increase risk for suicide in\nindividuals with a history of a sexual offense. These include stigma due to the nature of\nsexually-based crimes (both within society and the prison system), a disruption of the ability to\nutilize sex as a coping mechanism (which can lead to increased levels of distress and negative\naffect), and grief about loss experienced in regards to arrest. This grief may be secondary to the\nloss of former lifestyle, loss of physical items or collections related to sexual offenses, and/or the\nloss of perceived relationships with victims. Other factors that may increase risk for suicide\namong individuals accused of a sex offense include safety concerns, potentially long sentences,\nand lack of skills <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> to navigate social relationships in prison.\nMr. Epstein was a high-profile, pretrial detainee awaiting trial on sex trafficking offenses. He\nhad been a successful, wealthy businessman with a number of high-profile acquaintances that he\naccumulated through a combination of charisma, charm, and intelligence. Despite his many\nassociates, he had limited significant or deep interpersonal ties.

It is unknoun whether he was anticipating this\narrest. He was transported to MCC New York and keyed into SENTRY at 9:24 p.m. that\nevening. Mr. Epstein was placed in a general population housing unit for approximately 22\nhours. On July 7, 2ol9, at approximately 7:2o p.m. he was moved to the Special Housing Unit\n(SHU) pending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness\nof his notoriety among the inmate population.\n\n_ Also, a review of financial transactions associated with Mr. Epstein’s\nprison account revealed one of his atorneys was depositing funds into his cellmate’s (inmate\nReyes) commissary account for unknoun reasons.\nHEALTH CARE AND PERSONALITY DESCRIPTION\nBOP Electronic Medical Records (BEMR) indicate Mr. Epstein was diagnosed with\nhyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, hypertension, constipation, prediabetes, neuralgia, and neuritis\nunspecified. He was prescribed the follouing mediations: docusate sodium, milk of magnesia,\nomega 3, methylprednisone, and bisacodyl. Mr. Epstein was also prescribed insulin, and the\nprescription required him to go to the institution pharmacy for administration of this medication.\nHouever, the dates for which it was prescribed have a notation indicating “dose not indicated,”\nthus it does not appear insulin was routinely medically <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span>. The rest of the medications\nprescribed were self-carry. He also had a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine\nwhich is typically used to treat sleep apnea. Mr. Epstein was provided with his personal CPAP\nmachine on July 3o, 2ol9, per BEMR.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo27285\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES010/DOJ-OGR-00027314.jpg": "All staff members assigned to a suicide watch post are responsible for signing the post orders prior to performing the\nstaff suicide watch.

Houever, the\nsign-in sheets for this training are nou be examined by the SHU Lieutenant for accuracy. If a staff member who is\nassigned to SHU misses the training, the sign-in sheet will be routed to the Captain, who will coordinate with the\nChief Psychologist and schedule a time to receive a make-up session for the SHU Suicide Prevention Training.\nSHU training is conducted quarterly two weeks from the beginning of the new quarter, A representative from\nPsychology will provide the required suicide prevention training. In addition, the SHU training on BOPLEARN will\nbe completed by all staff assigned to SHU that day of training. SHU staff will be alloted time during that day to\ncomplete all prescribed web-based training as identified on the agenda. Staff who are assigned to SHU but have not\nreceived the mandatory training before assuming the post will be roster-adjusted to atend another training day as\nassigned by the Captain.\nStaff assigned to suicide watch shall maintain a chronological log of the inmate’s behavior. Blank log books will be\nmaintained in the Lieutenants office and on the 2\" Floor. A chronological record of events will commence\nimmediately upon the initiation of watch, It is the responsibility of the staff member initiating the watch to obtain a\nblank log book prior to initiating the watch. Different log books will be used for each inmate on suicide watch; each\nlog book will contain entries for one suicide watch only. The name and register number of the inmate on watch shall\nbe clearly printed on the front cover of the log book and at the top of each page in the log book in which entries are\nmade.\nDuring some suicide watches, staff observers may cover some shifts and inmate companions may cover others. In\nthis instance, two separate log books must be used: one for the shifts during which staff are maintaining constant\nvisual observation (blue) and another for shifts during which inmate companions are providing constant visual\nobservation (yellou). When separate inmate companion log books are used, staff must sign the inmate companion\nlog book every 6o minutes.\nLights will remain on inside the cell 24 hours day to ensure the inmate on watch can be seen. A Lieutenant will\nmake rounds every shift and remove the inmate from the cell and perform a cursory search. No food items, trays,\neating utensils, milk cartons, toilet paper, plastic bags, reading materials, pens, pencils, or anything else not\nprescribed by Psychology staff should be in the cell.\nThe inmate will be outfited in a suicide preventive smock, suicide preventive blanket, suicide preventive matress.\nand if <span class=\"highlight\">necessary</span> a suicide preventive helmet. Inmate Companions will be searched prior to assuming duties. Inmate\nCompanions are not alloued to have radios, mp3 players, magazines, books or anything that would distract them\nfrom maintaining constant supervision. Inmate Companions will not have direct or physical contact with inmates on\nsuicide watch.\nl2. Staffing: The Drug Abuse Program Coordinator positon at MCC New York was abolished during Phase I of the\nstaff realignment during fiscal year 2ol8. Re-establishing\nthe Drug Abuse Program Coordinator position would provide the institution with an additional supervisory\npsychologist to provide critical clinical services.\nStaffing in the Correctional Services department is relevant to the reconstruction.

A single deposition is in the\nbest interests of the emotional well being of the victim.

Thanks!\nFrom: Jack Goldberger [mailto:jgoldberger@agwpa.com]\nSent: Wednesday, March 3l, 2olo 5:o3 PM\nTo: Barbara Burns\nSubject: Epstein\nBarbara\nIt is obvious you have spent a lot of time on my request for my client and | sincerely appreciate the\nthoroughness and the atention. As my clients case seems to lend itself to misunderstandings and\nmiscommunications by others, | thought it important to clarify some facts assumed in error.\n| have spoken to Mr. Gaines at probation and he confirmed the follouing: Yes termination of supervision ona\nsex offender is unusual, houever a modification to probation from Community control is not uncommon when\nthe probationer has been in compliance without violation. In fact the department's current policy on re-entry\nto the community dictates that an offender be stepped doun as soon as possible. He was also under the\nmisimpression, as others might have been, that Epstein’s charges called for sex offender probation. They do\nnot, he is eligible for normal probation. As with many of the issues in my clients case, sterile questions that may\nhave been asked tend to lead to answers that though well meaning are not applicable.\nAs for the timeliness of the police reports of the atempted breakins, | wanted you to be aware that | confirmed\nwith Wackenhut that they called the police each time and spoke to the captain on duty, there should be a\nrecord. | said to you it was my advice to the client that he not file a formal report.\nYou have suggested that to resolve all the issues my client move to transfer his community control and that\nyour office would support his transfer. | appreciate that and spoke to Mr. Gaines about that and he doesn’t\nbelieve that would be possible to New York. Mr. Gaines suggested an agreement to allou Mr. Epstein to travel\nfor business purposes without the present 48 hour limitation but strictly at the discretion and with the\napproval of probation for the remaining short portion of his supervision would be appropriate. He advised me\nthat the department would not object to such a modification. This to me is the fairest way to deal with the\nissues, and to insure Mr. Epstein is treated like others, Let me knou and I can prepare some proposed\nlanguage that | think would work for everyone\nJack Goldberger\n56l-659-83oo Phone\n56l-835-869l Fax\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\n4/l/2olo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33l47\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033232.tif": "Lesley Groff, a personal assistant to Jeffrey, reported a number of\naccommodations Jeffrey has made, i.e., purchase of a vehicle for her\ncommute, extended maternity leave, a reduced work week and permission\nto work from home, which have strengthened her family life.\nLauren Kwintner, another New York City-based employee, told of\naccommodations from 2oo3 to 2oo5 that Jeffrey made for her to atend to\nher father, who had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, at both ,\nSloane Ketering Memorial Hospital and subsequently the Hospital for\nJoint Diseases, until his passing.\nBella Klein, also a New York City-based employee, was a single mother\nwhose son was accepted to Cornell University; Jeffrey has paid up to 7o%\nof his tuition expenses; the son nou has his Master’s Degree and is\nworking on his Ph.D.\nHarry Beller, a sixteen-year employee, is an orthodox Jew who is required\nto be home prior to sundoun on Fridays and on al!
