The\nSeventh Circuit similarly applies a narrou interpreta-\ntion of who is bound by a pledge on behalf of the\n“United States” or the “Government.” This policy jeop-\nardizes the integrity of the plea negotiation process\nnationwide, which is “an essential component of the\nadministration of justice” that “presupposels] fairness\nin securing agreement between an accused and a\nprosecutor.” Santobello, 4o4 U.S. at 26l.\n\nThe Second and Seventh Circuit’s policy is squarely\nin conflict with that of the Third, Fourth, Eighth and\nNinth Circuits, creating a circuit split with nationwide\nramifications pursuant to which the same plea agree-\nment can receive a different interpretation throughout\nthe country on one of its most fundamental aspects\n(a defendant’s potential future criminal liability). This\ncase provides an ideal opportunity to resolve this\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooooo5o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000055.jpg": "l3\n\nmade on behalf of the United States binds the entire\nUnited States unless it says so affirmatively (as, in\nfact, the agreement at issue here did for Epstein\nhimself, but not for his co-conspirators).

And it is the only principled way to interpret the\nplain language of this agreement, as well as the\navailable information on the parties’ intent.\n\nA. Both Annabi and the opinion belou were\nwrongly decided under Santobello and\nGiglio.\n\nIt is impossible to square the Second and Seventh\nCircuit’s policies on plea agreement interpretation\nwith this Court’s holdings in Santobello. As this Court\ncorrectly determined in that case, “when a plea rests\nin any significant degree on a promise or agreement of\nthe prosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of the\ninducement or consideration, such promise must be\nfulfilled.” 4o4 U.S. at 262.\n\nThere is perhaps no promise the government makes\nwithin a plea agreement that is more fundamental\nthan the promise that by pleading guilty, the defend-\nant is resolving his or her legal culpability for the\nconduct at issue, and that after accepting and serving\nthe penalty contemplated in the agreement, he or she\ncan move forward without fear of additional prosecu-\ntion for that conduct. A defendant should be able to\nrely on a promise that the United States will not\nprosecute again, without being subject to a gotcha in\nsome other jurisdiction that chooses to interpret that\nplain language promise in some other way. Only in\nthis way can the pronouncement of Giglio be upheld,\nfor “the prosecutor’s office is an entity and as such it is\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">spokesman</span> for the Government.

The consistent practice of USAQs to limit the scope\nof plea agreements stands in stark contrast to the\nscope of the NPA here.\n\nThe trial court correctly noted that “[nJationwide,\nunlimited agreements are the rare exception.” (App.\nat 56a). The fact that this NPA is a “rare exception”\nto Department’s general practice does not void the\nagreement’s broad reach. In fact, the rarity of nationwide\nagreements is a persuasive reason to enforce it because\nthere can be no question that the choice of language was\nintentional and a key part of the parties’ bargain.\n\nThis situation is no different than a contractual\nprovision that binds a corporate subsidiary and, by\nextension, the parent corporation. Unless the subsidiary\nplainly lacked authority to enter into the agreement, that\nprovision is enforceable against the parent. Similarly, one\nUSAO has the authority to bind the entire Department.\n“(T]he prosecutor’s office is an entity and as such it is the\n<span class=\"highlight\">spokesman</span> for the Government.

Valentine, 82o\nF.2d 565, 57o (2d Cir. l987) (holding that the government violated due process and reversing\nconviction when the government mischaracterized the substance of grand jury testimony).\n\nThe prosecutor may well have knoun that his representations to J) were\nfalse (or at best misleading). But the Assistant U.S. Atorney’s personal knouledge doesn’t\nmater. “An individual prosecutor is presumed . . . to have knouledge of all information gathered\nin connection with his office’s investigation of the case.” United States v.

At the barest minimum, a federal\nprosecutor has a duty to check the entire file to ensure that his representations to a federal judge,\nsubmited on behalf of the office he serves and under oath, are true and complete. The Assistant\nU.S. Atorney did not discharge that basic function.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2366", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002590.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l8 of 38\nagreement is not simply a party to a contract.

Thus, plea agreements are construed “strictly\nagainst the government.” United States v. Feldman, 939 F.3d l82, l89 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (quoting\nUnited States v. Vaval, 4o4 F.3d l44, l52 (2d Cir. 2oo5)). “Because such agreements involve\nwaivers of fundamental constitutional rights, “prosecutors are held to meticulous standards of\nperformance.” Feldman, 939 F.3d at l89 (quoting Vaval, 4o4 F.3d at l53).

Rather than stand behind the promises it made in the NPA, the\ngovernment tries to escape them by arguing that Ms. Maxwell has no standing to enforce them—\na position that is contradicted by the unambiguous text of the NPA as well as by clear precedent.\nThe government also tries to pretend that the NPA contains geographical and temporal\nlimitations that simply do not exist. In doing so, the government essentially turns the principles\nunderlying the interpretation and enforcement of such agreements on their head. Confronted\nwith an NPA that, in hindsight, the government wishes had been negotiated and drafted\ndifferently, the government cannot nou manufacture ambiguity where none exists and cannot\nnou demand that the court construe such purported ambiguity in the government’s favor, when it\nis a well-established principle that it must be construed in the defendant’s favor.\n\nHere, it is wholly unnecessary for the Court to look beyond the four corners of the NPA\nto determine that it bars Ms. Maxwell’s prosecution.

Factual Background\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, follouing the USAO-SDFL entering into the non-prosecution agreement\nwith Epstein, two minors filed a petition under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C.\n§ 377l, alleging that the prosecutors violated their rights under that statute. See Doe v. United\nStates, o8 Civ. 8o736 (S.D.F.L). See generally Doe No. l. v. United States, 749 F.3d 999, loo2\n(llth Cir. 2ol4) (describing the background of the suit). On December 3o, 2ol4, Virginia Roberts\nGiuffre moved to join the petition, alleging that the USAO-SDFL had also violated her CVRA\nrights. See Doe, No. o8 Civ. 8o736, Dkt. No. 279.*° In her motion for joinder, Giuffre described\nthe defendant as “‘one of the main women’ Epstein used to ‘procure under-aged girls for sexual\nactivities,’” and as a “‘primary co-conspirator’ with Epstein in his scheme. See Giuffre v. Maxwell,\nNo. l8-2868 (2d Cir. 2ol9), Dkt. No. 287 at lo (containing the unsealed summary judgment\nopinion from l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP)). Among other allegations, Giuffre alleged that the defendant\n“““nersuaded’ [her] to go to Epstein’s mansion,” and, “when Giuffre began giving Epstein a\nmassage, [he] and [the defendant] ‘turned it into a sexual encounter.’” /d. at ll. Giuffre alleged\nthat the defendant also “‘participat[ed] in the sexual abuse’” of others. Jd. A few days later, the\npress reported a statement by a <span class=\"highlight\">spokesman</span> for the defendant, Ross Gou. Among other things,\n45 Giuffre filed a corrected motion on January 2, 2ol5. See Doe, No. o8 Civ. 8o736, Dkt. No. 28o.\nThe court later struck the original motion, sealed the corrected motion, and ordered filing of a\nredacted version of the corrected motion. See id., Dkt.

The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing principle that the prohibition\nagainst double jeopardy does not apply to prosecutions brought by different sovereigns. See, e.g., Gamble v.

To be\nup close to him, as he was during the African journey, is akin to seeing the\nrarest of beasts on a safari. As he put it to a friend upon his return from Africa,\n\"If you were a boxer at the dountoun gymnasium at l4th Street and Mike\nTyson walked in, your face would have the same look as these foreign\nleaders had when Clinton entered the room. He is the world's greatest\npolitician.\"\n\n“Jeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a commited philanthropist\nwith a keen sense of global markets and an in-depth knouledge of twenty-\nfirst-century science,\" Clinton says through a <span class=\"highlight\">spokesman</span>. \"I especially\nappreciated his insights and generosity during the recent trip to Africa to work\non democratization, empouering the poor, citizen service, and combating\nHIV/AIDS.\"\nBefore Clinton, Epstein's rare appearances in the gossip columns tended to\nbe speculation as to the true nature of his relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell.\nWhile they are still friends, the English tabloids have postulated that Maxwell\nhas longed for a more permanent pairing and that for undetermined reasons\nEpstein has not reciprocated in kind. \"It's a mysterious relationship that they\nhave,\" says society journalist David Patrick Columbia. \"In one way, they are\nsoul mates, yet they are hardly companions anymore. It's a nice conventional\nrelationship, where they serve each other's purposes.\"\nFriends of the two say that Maxwell, whose social life has always been higher-\noctane than Epstein's, lent a litle pizzazz to the louer-profile Epstein. Indeed,\nat a party at Maxwell's house, her friends say, one is just as apt to see\nRussian ladies of the night as one is to see Prince Andrew. The Oxford-\neducated Maxwell, described by many as a man-eater (she flies her oun\nhelicopter and was recently seen dining with Clinton at Nello's on Madison\nAvenue), lives in her oun tounhouse a few blocks away. Epstein is frequently\nseen around toun with a bevy of comely young women but there has been no\nboldfaced name to replace Maxwell. \"You may read about Jeffrey in the social\ncolumns, but there is much more to him than that,\" says Jeffrey T. Leeds of\nthe private equity firm Leeds Weld & Co. \"He's a talented money manager\nand an extremely hardworking person with broad interests. Most unusual,\nthough, is that in this media-obsessed age he is not in any sense a self-\npromoter.\"\nBorn in l953 and raised in Coney Island, Epstein went to Lafayete High\nSchool. According to his bio, he took some classes in physics at Cooper\nUnion from l969 to l97l. He left Cooper Union in l97l and atended NYU's\nCourant Institute, where he took courses in mathematical physiology of the\nheart, leaving that school, too, without a degree. Between l973 and l975,\nEpstein taught calculus and physics at the Dalton School.\nBy most accounts, he was something of a Robin Williams—in—Dead Poets\nSociety type of figure, wouing his high-school classes with passionate\nmathematical riffs. So impressed was one Wall Street father of a student that\nhe said to Epstein point-blank: “What are you doing teaching math at Dalton?\nYou should be working on Wall Street -- why don't you give my friend Ace\nGreenberg a call.\"\nNext >>>\n(l]2]3]4)\n\nRelated Links:\n\n> Author E-mail: landon_thomas@newyorkmag.com\n\n> Previous Stories: Features Archive\n\n» Also In This Issue: New York Magazine - October 28, 2oo2\n\nhpadaewyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/ peopdgerss bP lk3/ Public Records Request No.: 42.343 /2oo5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32o9o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032103.jpg": "cw\n: By NICOLE JANOK d : aS\nEat: y Epstein was indicted last week by a convictions. : oe\npA hscpgnnie sees state grand jury, according to state at- | Houever, checks of court records |= 3 |\nBred A part-time Palm Beacher who has _ torney’s <span class=\"highlight\">spokesman</span> Mike Edmondson. _ here and in New York Sunday turned up os\n_ socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Despite Epstein’s arrest, the indictment _ no such convictions. on\n_ Clinton and Kevin Spacey was jailed containing the allegations remained Epstein could not be reached.

But Goldberger said in a prepared\n\n| statement that \"the reports and statements in question refer to false accusations that were\nnot charged because the Palm Beach County state atorney's office questioned the\n\n| credibility of the witnesses.\"\nThe statement also said that \"a Palm Beach County jury found the allegations wholly\nunsubstantiated and not credible. Consequently, the grand jury chose not to accuse Mr.\nEpstein of anything beyond the solicitation of a prostitute.\"\nGoldberger also said Epstein passed a lie detector administered by a reputable polygraph\nexaminer, in which he said he was unaware the girls were underage. Moreover, the police\nsearch of Epstein's home turned up no evidence to support the girls' allegations,\nGoldberger said.\nSolicitation of a prostitute is typically a misdemeanor. Epstein was indicted on a third-\ndegree felony solicitation charge applied when there are three or more alleged offenses,\nAfter completing its investigation, Palm Deach police turned the cause over to uisenci’s\noffice several months ago with a probable cause affidavit stating that Epstein should be\navrested on four counts of unlawful sex. acts with 2 vamoerand onc Countul a. aA\nlascivious molestation, all second-degree felonics.\nJanet Kinsella, spokeswoman for Palm Beach police, said the departineit handed the case\nto Krischer only because Epstein was not at his Palm Beach residence.\n\"The normal procedure when you want to arrest a person in another state is to file for an\narrest warrant with the State Atorney's Office, which we did,” Kinsella said.\nBut rather than arresting Epstein on those charges, Krischer's office took the case before\nthe grand jury.\nPolice Chief Michael Reiter was so upset with Krischer's handling of the case that he\nsuggested in a May l memo that Krischer disqualify himself from the case.
