The defense respectfully requests\nthat the hearing take place before the holidays and the government is amenable to that schedule.\nAccordingly, the parties propose the follouing briefing schedule:\n\nDefense submission: December 7, 2o2o\n\nGovernment response: December l6, 2o2o\n\nDefense reply due: December l8, 2o2o\n\nHearing: December 2l, 2o2o (subject to the Court’s availability)\n\nPer the Court’s order, the defense will send our submissions to the Court under seal on\nthe dates mentioned above and will include a proposed redacted version of the submission to be\nfiled on the docket for the Court’s consideration. We ask that the Court order the government to\nfollou the same procedure for its submission.\n\nAlso, although the Court’s Individual Practices in Criminal Cases do not contain a page\nlimit for motions, we are mindful of the Court’s 25-page limit for civil motions. In light of the\nnumerous topics the defense must cover in connection with the renewed bail application, the\ndefense respectfully requests leave to file a motion not to exceed 4o pages. The defense does not\nobject to the government receiving a similar <span class=\"highlight\">enlargement</span> of pages to respond.\n\nYour consideration is greatly appreciated.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool849\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002783.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl7l Filed o3/23/2l Page3ofl8\n=\" On-premises 24/7 private security to prevent Ms. Maxwell from leaving the\nresidence without pre-approval by the Court or Pretrial Services and to\nescort her when authorized to leave the residence;\n= Visitors to be pre-approved by Pretrial Services;\n= Strict supervision by Pretrial Services;\n= Such other terms as the Court deems appropriate.\n\nThe government goes to great lengths to oppose bail arguing technicalities and\noffering unfounded innuendo ripped from the tabloid headlines to avoid addressing the\nmerits of Ms. Maxwell’s exceptional bail package, which puts at risk everything she has,\nincluding the assets of her spouse and the financial security of her family and closest\nfriends.\n\nThe Court Retains Jurisdiction to Decide Maters Related to Bail\n\nThe government asserts that the Court should not consider the present bail motion\nbecause appeal of denial of the Second Bail Motion, not yet briefed, is pending before the\nSecond Circuit.
