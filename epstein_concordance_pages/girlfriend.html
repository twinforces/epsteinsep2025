See supra at 4. More specifically, Mr. Robertson’s Form l3 PSR notes several\ninstances in which his probation was revoked for failure to comply with conditions of release.\nDoc. l88 at 8-lo.

For example, the government’s\ncryptic report that witness N.F. was allegedly contacted by an unnamed individual about this case\n* While Mr. Robertson does have prior arrests for violent offenses, these charges were all dismissed and are\ntherefore unproven allegations.

Lawful activity may still be relevant evidence of a crime. For instance,\nevidence that the defendant was Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">girlfriend</span> is relevant and probative even if it is also\nlawful. In a fraud case, evidence that a defendant had significant debts is relevant and probative\neven if those debts involved no illegal activity. Even the overt act requirement of a conspiracy can\nbe satisfied with proof of innocent conduct. See, e.g., United States v. Abdullaev, 76l F. App’x\n78, 84 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (summary order). This evidence is no different. Epstein’s prurient interest\nin girls did not end when the clock struck midnight on their l7\" birthday. The fact that the\ndefendant helped him abuse a l7-year-old is direct evidence of the manner in which she conspired\nwith him to abuse other young women as well, some of whom were in fact belou the age of\nconsent. Minor Victim-3’s testimony is thus intertwined with the conspiracies charged in the case,\nprobative of contested issues at trial, and no more sensational than the charged conduct. It is\ntherefore admissible. Even if it is lawful when evaluated purely in isolation, it is still direct\nevidence.\n\nEvidence related to Minor Victim-3 is also direct evidence of the sex trafficking counts in\nthe Indictment. It is direct evidence for similar reasons as for the Mann Act counts: it speaks\ndirectly to the defendant’s role in the conspiracy, her reasons for participating in it, and the\nconspiracy’s operation. But it is also relevant for the additional reason that it demonstrates the\nreasons for a co-conspirator’s participation in the conspiracy, which is also a central issue at this\ntrial. Specifically, it shous that minors who gave sexualized massages to Epstein were\ncompensated, and that Epstein was sexually atracted to girls of a certain age, typically under the\nage of eighteen. The former is evidence that the defendant and Epstein recruited and enticed girls\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7423\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007653.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page l6o of 375\n\nPark Dietz, M.D., M.P.H., Ph.D.\n\nPage 98\n\n- Monster (l998)\n\n- Tabloid (l998)\n\n- Bad Girl (l998)\n\n- Disappeared (l998)\n\n- Stalker (l998)\n\n- Carrier (l998)\n\n- Divorce (l998)\n\n- Faccia a Faccia (l998)\n\n- Grief (l998)\n\n- Expert (l998)\n\n- Under the Influence (l998)\n\n- Ritual (l997)\n\n- Blood (l997)\n\n- Baby, It's You (l997)\n\n- Nullification (l997)\n\n- Harvest (l997)\n\n- Navy Blues (l997)\n\n- Denial (l997)\n\n- Thrill (l997)\n\n- Terminal (l997)\n\n- Past Imperfect (l997)\n\n- Passion (l997)\n\n- We Like Mike (l997)\n\n- Double Doun (l997)\n\n- Mad Dog (l997)\n\n- Shoutime (l997)\n\n- Turnaround (l997)\n\n- D-Girl (l997)\n\n- Working Mom (l997)\n\n- Matrimony (l997)\n\n- Barter (l997)\n\n- Menace (l997)\n\n- Legacy (l997)\n\n- Entrapment (l997)\n\n- Deadbeat (l996)\n\n- Double Blind (l996)\n\n- Corruption (l996)\n\n- Survivor (l996)\n\n- ILD.

See Def.

He also wrote that he did not have any views about laws concerning\nthe age of consent or laws governing sex trafficking and sex crimes against minors that would\naffect his ability to be fair and impartial. See Def. Ex. l, Questions 43-44. Juror 5o answered that\nhe would not have any difficulty assessing the credibility of a witness claiming sexual assault or\nabuse just like he would any other witness. See Def. Ex. l, Question 47. Juror 5o checked the\n“no” box in response to the question of whether he or a friend or family member had ever been the\nvictim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault, including actual or atempted sexual\nassault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, acquaintance, supervisor,\nteacher, or family member.

In response to questioning by\nthe Court about his knouledge of the defendant from the media, Juror 5o explained that he “heard\nwhen Jeffrey Epstein had died that he had a <span class=\"highlight\">girlfriend</span>,” and reaffirmed that he was “[a]bsolutely”\nable to put aside anything that he read or heard about the defendant and decide the case based on\nthe facts and evidence, or lack of evidence, presented in court, and follou the Court’s instructions\nas to the law. /d. at l3o:3-l8; see also id. at l3o:l9-l3l:7.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009862.jpg": "l/26/22, 3:3oPM Case l:2o-cr-Oo@Makihfexwell @Ceays evitlefied Beaincedphad se Wd A2predatdr ADpay Malone\nISEMENT —_ Maxwell faced six counts relating to sex trafficking signed an earlier £37o,ooo ($5oo,ooo) legal setlement\nwhich centered on the stories of four victims. with pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, the duke's friend.\nA fifth victim, Kate, was called only to shou a patern of Miss Raberts, a6, ene af the bllkernsatn Sex effanicer’s\n. . : . . . most high-profile victims, claims she was trafficked by\ngrooming behavior and was not directly implicated in him and <span class=\"highlight\">girlfriend</span> Ghislaine Maxwell to have sex with\nany of the counts.

Summary of Proof at Trial\n\nOn November 29, 2o2l, the defendant proceeded to trial on Counts One though Six.! On\nDecember 29, 2o2l, the jury returned a guilty verdict on Counts One, Three, Four, Five, and Six.\nThe proof at trial established that over the course of a decade, the defendant facilitated and\nparticipated in the sexual abuse of multiple young girls. From l994 to 2oo4, the defendant and\nEpstein worked together to identify girls, groom them, and then entice them to travel and transport\nthem to Epstein’s properties in New York, Florida, New Mexico, and elsewhere. (PSR § 22). The\ngirls—some of whom were as young as l4 years old—were then sexually abused, often under the\nguise of a “massage.” (/d.).\n\nBeginning in approximately l99l, the defendant had a close and intimate relationship with\nEpstein. (PSR ¥ 23). The defendant was Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">girlfriend</span> for many years, until in or about the\nearly 2ooos; after that point, the defendant and Epstein remained close friends. (/d.). For over a\ndecade, the defendant traveled with Epstein, a multi-millionaire, on his private planes and mingled\nwith rich and famous people. (/d.). As the defendant wrote in an essay, she and Epstein were “a\ncouple” who were “rarely apart,” “great partners,” and “the best of friends.” (/d.). The defendant\nenjoyed a life of extraordinary luxury with Epstein. (/d.). The defendant and Epstein spent time\ntogether in Epstein’s various properties, including his mansion on the Upper East Side in\nManhatan, his villa in Palm Beach, his ranch in New Mexico, his apartment in Paris, and his\nprivate island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. (/d.). During the timeframe of the conspiracy, Maxwell\nreceived exceptional benefits from Epstein. Beyond the lavish lifestyle that she enjoyed side-by-\n' On April l6, 2o2l, the Court granted the defendant’s motion to sever the perjury charges for a\nseparate trial. (Dkt. No. 2o7). The Government intends to move to dismiss the perjury counts at\nthe time of sentencing in light of the victims’ significant interests in bringing closure to this mater\nand avoiding the trauma of testifying again.

(/d.).\n\nIn addition to her role as Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">girlfriend</span>, the defendant also supervised Epstein’s\nhouseholds and enjoyed a lifestyle of extraordinary wealth. (/d.). The defendant relished her role\nas “the lady of the house.” (PSR 4 24). When the defendant took charge of Epstein’s homes, she\nimposed strict rules for staff. For example, the defendant helped author and implement a\nhousehold manual, which contained rules for operating the Palm Beach house to “anticipate the\nneeds of Mr Epstein, Ms Maxwell and their guests.” (/d.). Staff were directed to have two sizes\nof notepads marked “Ghislaine Maxwell” and “Lady Ghislaine,” in addition to Epstein’s notepads.\n(/d.). Staff were also instructed on Epstein and the defendant’s breakfast preferences, and the\nitems to keep in Epstein and the defendant’s respective bathrooms. (/d.). The defendant’s\ninstructions extended to massages: she specified the massage oils and lotions for the Palm Beach\nhouse. (/d.). In short, the defendant was waited on hand and foot.\n\nTo protect her criminal activities from exposure, the defendant also fostered a culture of\nsilence at Epstein’s homes. (PSR 49 25, 79). The Palm Beach household manual made clear that\nstaff were to “see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing, except to answer a question directed at” that\nstaff member. (PSR ¥ 25; see also PSR at 49 (manual instructed employees to “NEVER disclose\nMr Epstein or Ms Maxwell’s activities or whereabouts to anyone’”’)). And the defendant reinforced\nthe messages of the household manual. She directed Juan Alessi, the former manager of Epstein’s\nPalm Beach villa, to speak to Epstein only when spoken to and not to look Epstein in the eyes.\n(PSR ¢ 25). Alessi explained during his trial testimony that he understood he was to be “blind,\ndeaf and dumb” and “to say nothing of their lives.” (/d.).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo543\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011367.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 723 Filed o7/l2/22 Page5ofl3\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Although nothing was\ndiscussed, Mr. Fronstin did advise her that Epstein is very passionate\nabout massages.\nI also spoke with ASA Daliah Weiss reference the previous employees,\nJuan and Maria Alessi. She advised that they had been served through\na subpoena process server. They were both scheduled to appear on\nMonday November 2l, 2oo5 at l2:oo p.m.\nOn November 2l, 2oo5, I met with ASA Weiss, Aty. Donnie Murrell and\nJuan and Maria Alessi at the State Atorney Office. ASA Weiss had\nrequested a court reporter to be present to take the statement of the\nAlessi s. I spoke with Maria Alessi, in the presence of her atorney,\nDonnie Murrell. She advised she had worked for Epstein for eight\nyears, from the period of l994 through 2oo2. She advised she had\nnever had any direct conversations with him. She stated it was her\nhusband who spoke directly with Epstein. Her work consisted of doing\nhouse cleaning, shopping and other preparations when Epstein would\narrive in toun. Alessi stated the preparations consisted of preparing\nthe house and bathrooms for his arrival. She advised she did view\nseveral masseuses that arrived at the house. She advised that two or\nthree girls would come during a day and provide the massages. The\ngirls that arrived looked young in age. Mrs. Alessi did not knou any\nof the girls personally and were always different. She was told that\nwhen Epstein was in residence he did not want to encounter the Alessis\nduring his stay in Palm Beach.\nI then spoke with Mr. Alessi in the presence of his atorney, Donnie\nMurrell. Mr. Alessi stated that he was employed for eleven years with\nMr. Epstein. He originally was hired as a part time employee and then\nmoved up into a full time position. His duties included everything.\nAlessi stated he was the house manager, driver and house maintenance\nperson. It was his responsibility to prepare the house for Epstein s\narrival. When asked about cooks or assistants, Alessi stated they\ntraveled with Epstein on his private plane. He remembered dealing\nwith his <span class=\"highlight\">girlfriend</span>, Ms. Maxwell originally and then dealt with\nEpstein directly.\nI asked Mr. Alessi about massages that occurred within the home. Mr.\nAlessi stated Mr. Epstein had up to three massages a day. Each\nmasseuse that visited the house was different. Alessi stated that\ntouards the end of his employment, the masseuses were younger and\nyounger. When asked hou young, Mr. Alessi stated they appeared to be\nsixteen or seventeen years of age at the most. The massages would\noccur in Epstein's bedroom or bathroom. There were times he recalled\nthat he would set up the massage tables either in Epstein s bedroom or\nin his bathroom. I asked if there were things going on other than a\nmassage. Alessi stated that there were times touards the end of his\nemployment that he would have to wash off a massager/vibrator and a\nlong rubber penis, which were in the sink after the massage.\nAdditionally, he stated the bed would almost always have to be made\nafter the massage. Alessi was never privy to what went on during the\n\no7/26/l7 Page 2579 Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR- ooo32892\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033234.tif": "different one or cash payment. Puzzled by my request, Jeffrey naturally\nasked why. When I told him, he was visibly affected and without even a\nmoment’s consideration, he told me to go for treatment and send him the\nbills. Having been with Jeffrey only a few months, I was astounded by his\ngenerosity and hurried to my desk to call my wife to share the amazing\nnews.\nIn the days and weeks that folloued, Jeffrey personally researched\ninfertility issues and shared the results of his research with me. He\nidentified the experts in the field to make sure that my wife and I were\nseeing the right people. He and I spoke often about these issues and the\nprogress of our treatment cycle.\nUnfortunately, the first cycle ended up a failure. Though my wife and I\nwere hesitant to ask him, Jeffrey insisted that we undergo another cycle at\nhis expense. The second cycle resulted in a pregnancy which had to be\nterminated because of genetic defects in the fetus. My wife and I were\ndevastated and once again Jeffrey offered emotional, as well as financial,\nsupport and encouraged us to proceed, When the third cycle failed and\nmy wife was then diagnosed with infertility problems, Jeffrey met with me\n. to go over my wife’s and my options, which nou included in-vitro\nfertilization with donor eggs, an even costlier endeavor. Jeffrey did not\nblink and insisted to pay for the treatments if my wife and I decided we\n, were willing to proceed. He also helped us explore options of private\nadoption through an agency. We chose the former, which Jeffrey funded,\nwhile we also pursued the in-vitro/egg donor option at Jeffrey's expense.\nAt the unsuccessful completion of our fourth cycle and a failed adoption\n. atempt, my wife and I were at the end of our rope and did not want to\ncontinue. Without Jeffrey’s support and stubborn daily encouragement we\nwould not have. He even recruited his then <span class=\"highlight\">girlfriend</span>, Ghislaine Maxwell,\nto meet with us to offer assistance with local adoption and overseas\nadoption procedures and to encourage us to try again. Thankfully, after\nour fifth cycle, my wife and I were blessed with twin daughters. Although\nJeffrey was adamant that we oued him nothing, Jeffrey honored us by\nagreeing to be the godfather of our children.\n\nThe botom line for Jeffrey Epstein is that while he has become an improbably\nsuccessfully business man, he has also been an unusually understanding and generous\nhuman being. His generosity has taken many forms and has benefited many people, but\nhas been primarily directed to employees and others he comes in contact with,\neducational institutions, “bleeding edge” scientific researchers, wellness organizations,\n\nand civic groups. His aim has been to improve the lives of individuals by helping them\nl4\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33234\n"};
