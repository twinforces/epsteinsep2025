The Renewed Bail Application largely reiterates the same\nclaims regarding the defendant’s ties to the United States and her behavior after Epstein’s arrest\nthat the Court already found unpersuasive. To the extent the Renewed Bail Application presents\nnew information, it consists primarily of financial data that was certainly knoun to the defendant\nat the time of her initial bail application and that the Court already assumed could be made\navailable (and thus rejected as <span class=\"highlight\">immaterial</span>) when ordering detention. Ultimately, nothing in the\nRenewed Bail Application alters the analysis that led this Court to conclude that the defendant\n“poses a substantial actual risk of flight,” and that no combination of conditions could assure her\nappearance. (Tr. 86). All three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors still weigh heavily in favor\nof detention, and the defense claims to the contrary do not warrant a revisiting of this Court’s well-\nreasoned and thorough prior decision.\n\nA. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense\n\nThe first Bail Reform Act factor indisputably weighs in favor of detention in this case. The\negregious conduct charged in the Indictment gives rise to a statutory presumption of detention, and\nthe Renewed Bail Motion makes no effort to challenge this Court’s prior conclusion that the nature\nand circumstances of the offense support detention. The charges in the Indictment describe\nhorrendous conduct involving the sexual abuse of multiple minor victims.

The Renewed Bail Application largely reiterates the same\nclaims regarding the defendant’s ties to the United States and her behavior after Epstein’s arrest\nthat the Court already found unpersuasive. To the extent the Renewed Bail Application presents\nnew information, it consists primarily of financial data that was certainly knoun to the defendant\nat the time of her initial bail application and that the Court already assumed could be made\navailable (and thus rejected as <span class=\"highlight\">immaterial</span>) when ordering detention. Ultimately, nothing in the\nRenewed Bail Application alters the analysis that led this Court to conclude that the defendant\n“poses a substantial actual risk of flight,” and that no combination of conditions could assure her\nappearance. (Tr. 86). All three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors still weigh heavily in favor\nof detention, and the defense claims to the contrary do not warrant a revisiting of this Court’s well-\nreasoned and thorough prior decision.\n\nA. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense\n\nThe first Bail Reform Act factor indisputably weighs in favor of detention in this case. The\negregious conduct charged in the Indictment gives rise to a statutory presumption of detention, and\nthe Renewed Bail Motion makes no effort to challenge this Court’s prior conclusion that the nature\nand circumstances of the offense support detention. The charges in the Indictment describe\nhorrendous conduct involving the sexual abuse of multiple minor victims.

Plaintiffs Claims\n\nIn 2ol5, Virginia Roberts Giuffre filed an action in this District alleging that Ghislaine\nMaxwell had defamed her. The alleged defamation centered on a statement from Ms. Maxwell’s\natorney denying as “untrue” and “obvious lies” Ms. Giuffre’s demonstrably false claims about\nher relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and others, including that she had been sexually trafficked\nto foreign presidents and award-winning scientists. The complaint alleged generally that Epstein\n“sexually abused” Giuffre between l999 and 2oo2 and that Epstein abused more than 3o girls\nbetween 2ool and 2oo7.'\n\nOver the course of discovery in the defamation action, it became obvious that Giuffre\n(and her lawyers) had lied or misstated critical facts including, inter alia, her age, the various\n\n' See Giuffre v.

Yet, here, that misdemeanor has\nbeen set up as the basis for federal charges for which the government seeks to impose\nyears of imprisonment, if not the equivalent of a life term. Not only is this troubling\nin approach, but even the pieced-together Mann Act charges are time-barred under\nthe applicable statute of limitations.\n\n* Inseeking and obtaining confidential materials from pending civil litigation against\nMs. Maxwell, including the deposition transcripts that form the basis of the two\nperjury counts in the indictment, the government a\n\n* The government has based the two counts of perjury on poorly worded questions that\nwere <span class=\"highlight\">immaterial</span> to the defamation case in which the depositions were taken, and has\nimproperly joined those counts to the Mann Act charges, as addressed in today’s\nmotions to dismiss and to sever those counts.\n\n* In an effort to allou other accusers to testify against Ms. Maxwell, the government\nhas added two conspiracy counts and, as alleged “‘overt acts” in furtherance of a\npurported conspiracy to cause minors to travel, has tacked on allegations from two\nother accusers—one of whom is not alleged to have traveled at all (and who was\nabove the legal age of consent in England, where the alleged conduct took place).\n\n¢ [nits rush to arrest Ms. Maxwell on the anniversary of Epstein’s indictment and\nmaximize the announcement’s appeal to the media, the government indicted Ms.\nMaxwell using a White Plains grand jury, thereby violating Ms. Maxwell’s right to a\ngrand jury drawn from a fair cross-section of the community.\n\n* Finally, the government has charged multiplicitous conspiracy counts based on\nidentical conduct, failed to disclose the names of the accusing witnesses or provide\nspecific facts in the indictment that would permit Ms. Maxwell to adequately prepare\nfor trial, and impermissibly delayed bringing this prosecution for 25 years in violation\nof Ms. Maxwell’s due process rights.\n\nThe hue and cry against Ms. Maxwell is unprecedented in both scale and severity. Under\nour system of justice, the need for the Court’s careful scrutiny of the government’s conduct, and\nfor the protection of the constitutional rights of a defendant facing the equivalent of a life\nsentence, is at its highest.

Counts One and Two arise under l8 U.S.C. § 2422(a), which, at the time of the\nalleged conduct, provided that a person could be charged with a criminal offense if she\n“knouingly persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any individual to travel in interstate or\nforeign commerce, or in any Territory or Possession of the United States, to engage in\nprostitution, or in any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal\noffense.” l8 U.S.C. § 2422(a) (l996) (emphasis added). That statute criminalizes enticing\n“individual[s],” not necessarily children, to cross state lines to engage in sexual activities. In\nother words, the act that violates § 2422(a) does not necessarily entail the enticement of a child\nto travel, because the enticement of an individual of any age satisfies the statute.\n\nFurther, § 2422(a) does not necessarily entail “sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping.”\nl8 U.S.C. § 3283. A substantive § 2422(a) offense is complete when an individual is\n“nersuade[d], induce[d], entice[d], or coerce[d]” to travel to engage in unlawful sexual activity,\nand a conspiracy to commit such an offense is complete when an agreement to “persuade[],\ninduce[], entice[], or coerce[]” an individual to engage in such travel is reached and a single\novert act is commited in furtherance of the agreement. It is <span class=\"highlight\">immaterial</span> to either offense whether\nany unlawful sexual activity subsequently occurs. Moreover, the intended unlawful sexual\nactivity required to establish a § 2422(a) offense need not involve “sexual or physical abuse, or\nkidnaping”; § 2422(a) is frequently, if not primarily, invoked in prosecutions involving the\nenticement of adults to travel to engage in prostitution, including on a voluntary basis. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Rashkovski, 3ol F.3d ll33, ll35-37 (9th Cir. 2oo2). For all of these reasons,\nCounts One and Two do not charge offenses involving the sexual or physical abuse or\nkidnapping of a child and thus are not subject to § 3283.\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo267o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002671.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 23 of 25\n\nNor does § 3283 apply to extend the statutes of limitations under Counts Three and Four.\nThose counts arise under l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a), which prohibits “transporting” minors across state\nlines “with intent that the [minor] engage in . . . any sexual activity for which any person can be\ncharged with a criminal offense” (emphasis added).? Neither that offense nor a conspiracy to\n“transport” a minor with such intent necessarily entails “the sexual or physical abuse, or\nkidnaping, of a child.” l8 U.S.C. § 3283. Instead, as with § 2422(a), the offense is a “crime of\nintent and a conviction is entirely sustainable even if no underlying criminal sexual act ever\noccurs.” United States v. Broxmeyer, 6l6 F.3d l2o, l29 n.8 (2d Cir. 2olo). For this reason,\nCounts Three and Four are not subject to § 3283’s extended statute of limitations.\n\nIt does not mater that the particular facts alleged in the indictment fall within § 3283.\n“The embellishment of the indictment does not lengthen the time for prosecution.” Bridges, 346\nU.S. at 222.

R. Crim. P. 7(d) Advisory Commitee’s Note. In the\nSecond Circuit, Fed. R. Crim.

Aug. 4, 2ol7) (striking\nlanguage stating that defendant “orchestrated four interrelated fraud schemes” where indictment\ncharged him in only two of those schemes).\n\nThe paragraphs of the indictment alleging that Ms. Maxwell was complicit in Epstein’s\n“sexual abuse” of Accuser-3 are irrelevant, inflammatory, and unduly prejudicial. The\nindictment is plainly insufficient to allege that Ms. Maxwell conspired to entice Accuser-3 to\ntravel, or to transport her in interstate or foreign commerce, let alone with the requisite intent.\nMoreover, the allegations regarding Accuser-3 have nothing to do with whether Ms. Maxwell\nconspired to violate § 2422(a) or § 2423(a) with respect to Accuser-l or Accuser-2. Thus, the\nonly explanation for the inclusion of alleged 2o-year-old allegations involving Accuser-3, and\nthe characterization of the alleged conduct as “sexual abuse,” is the likelihood that evidence\nsubmited in support of those allegations will have an unduly prejudicial effect and would not\nsurvive a balancing analysis under Fed.

The Indictment Is Insufficient to Allege a Conspiracy as to Accuser-3.\n\nTo establish a § 2422(a) conspiracy violation, the government must shou that Ms.\nMaxwell conspired to “knouingly persuade[], induce[], entice[], or coerce[] any individual to\ntravel in interstate or foreign commerce . . . to engage in prostitution, or in any sexual activity for\nwhich any person can be charged with a criminal offense.” l8 U.S.C. § 2422(a) (l996). To\nestablish a § 2423(a) conspiracy claim, the government must prove that Ms. Maxwell conspired\nto “knouingly transport[] an individual who ha[d] not atained the age of l8 years in interstate or\nforeign commerce . . . with intent that the individual engage in prostitution, or in any sexual\nactivity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense.” l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a)\n(l994); l8 U.S.C. § 2423 (l986).4\n\nThe government cannot shou that Ms. Maxwell conspired to commit either offense with\nrespect to Accuser-3. There is no allegation that Accuser-3 ever traveled in interstate or foreign\ncommerce, let alone that Ms. Maxwell, Epstein, or anyone else enticed her or otherwise caused\nher to do so. While the indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell encouraged Accuser-3 to massage\nEpstein in England “knouing that Epstein intended to sexually abuse [Accuser-3] during those\nmassages” (Indictment 9 lld, l7d), it alleges no facts connecting those allegations to any\ncontemplated interstate or foreign travel by Accuser-3—for any purpose. The indictment thus\ndoes not come close to alleging facts that would establish a conspiracy to violate either § 2422(a)\nor § 2423(a) as to Accuser-3.\n\nMoreover, any charge arising out of a conspiracy with respect to Accuser-3 would be\ntime-barred. The government contends that the indictment is timely under l8 U.S.C. § 3283,\nwhich, at the time of the alleged offenses, provided that a prosecution involving an “offense\n“ Section 2423 was amended effective September l3, l994, to add a subsection (b) and make cosmetic adjustments,\n<span class=\"highlight\">immaterial</span> here, to what is nou subsection (a).

Factual Background\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, follouing the USAO-SDFL entering into the non-prosecution agreement\nwith Epstein, two minors filed a petition under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C.\n§ 377l, alleging that the prosecutors violated their rights under that statute. See Doe v. United\nStates, o8 Civ. 8o736 (S.D.F.L). See generally Doe No. l. v. United States, 749 F.3d 999, loo2\n(llth Cir. 2ol4) (describing the background of the suit). On December 3o, 2ol4, Virginia Roberts\nGiuffre moved to join the petition, alleging that the USAO-SDFL had also violated her CVRA\nrights. See Doe, No. o8 Civ. 8o736, Dkt. No. 279.*° In her motion for joinder, Giuffre described\nthe defendant as “‘one of the main women’ Epstein used to ‘procure under-aged girls for sexual\nactivities,’” and as a “‘primary co-conspirator’ with Epstein in his scheme. See Giuffre v. Maxwell,\nNo. l8-2868 (2d Cir. 2ol9), Dkt. No. 287 at lo (containing the unsealed summary judgment\nopinion from l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP)). Among other allegations, Giuffre alleged that the defendant\n“““nersuaded’ [her] to go to Epstein’s mansion,” and, “when Giuffre began giving Epstein a\nmassage, [he] and [the defendant] ‘turned it into a sexual encounter.’” /d. at ll. Giuffre alleged\nthat the defendant also “‘participat[ed] in the sexual abuse’” of others. Jd. A few days later, the\npress reported a statement by a spokesman for the defendant, Ross Gou. Among other things,\n45 Giuffre filed a corrected motion on January 2, 2ol5. See Doe, No. o8 Civ. 8o736, Dkt. No. 28o.\nThe court later struck the original motion, sealed the corrected motion, and ordered filing of a\nredacted version of the corrected motion. See id., Dkt. No. 325 (Apr. 7, 2ol5).\n\nll7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o78\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003080.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l46 of 239\n(Def. Mot. 4, Ex. H at 9). “That knouledge,” the Court explained, “goes directly to the truth or\nfalsity of the alleged defamation, a key element of Plaintiffs claim.” (/d.). The Court therefore\nordered the defendant to answer the questions related to her sexual activity with or involving (l)\nEpstein, (2) Giuffre, (3) underage girls knoun to Epstein or who she thought might become knoun\nto Epstein, or (4) involving massage with individuals the defendant “knew to be, or believed might\nbe, knoun to Epstein.” (/d. at lo). The Court further ordered the defendant to answer questions\nabout her knouledge of the sexual activities of others in the same four categories. The Court added\nthat the “scope of Defendant’s answers are not bound by time period, though Defendant need not\nanswer questions that relate to none of these subjects or that is clearly not relevant.” (/d.). The\ndefendant sat for a second deposition on July 22, 2ol6, before the case setled.\n\nAs discussed more fully belou, the Indictment charges the defendant with two counts of\nperjury, one arising from statements made during the April 2ol6 deposition and one arising from\nstatements made during the July 2ol6 deposition. Indictment 9 2l, 23. (Ex. lo at 253:25-254:8,\n384:l5-2o; Ex. ll at 88:9-89:l3, 9l:22-92:l6, ll3:2-l2). The defendant nou moves to dismiss\nboth counts, arguing that the Court can effectively decide nou, as a mater of law, that the questions\nwere fundamentally ambiguous, her answers were true, and her answers were <span class=\"highlight\">immaterial</span> to the\ncase.\n\nB. Applicable Law\n\nSection l623(a) imposes criminal penalties on anyone who “in any proceeding before or\nancillary to any court .. . knouingly makes any false material declaration.” l8 U.S.C. § l623(a).\nIn perjury prosecutions, “whether the witness believes that an answer is true or false generally\nturns on the declarant’s understanding of the question.” United States v. Lighte, 782 F.2d 367, 372\n(2d Cir. l986). Accordingly, and as is true of virtually all factual issues, “[a] jury is best equipped\n\nll9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o8o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003082.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l48 of 239\nnatural meaning in the context in which words were used they were materially untrue, perjury was\nestablished.” United States v. Bonacorsa, 528 F.2d l2l8, l22l (2d Cir. l976). Critically, and as\nnoted with respect to Lighte above, courts generally evaluate whether a challenge to a perjury\ncount on the basis that a question was fundamentally ambiguous after trial and follouing the\ndevelopment of a full factual record. See, e.g., Strohm, 67l at ll75 (appeal follouing conviction);\nSarwari, 669 F.3d at 4o6 (same); Farmer, l37 F.3d at l269 (appeal follouing conviction and\npartial Rule 29 dismissal) Markiewicz, 978 F.2d at 8o8 (appeal follouing conviction); cf’ United\nStates v. Forde, 74o F. Supp. 2d 4o6, 4l3 (S.D.N.Y. 2olo) (denying a motion to dismiss a perjury\ncount). Indeed, the defendant cites no case in which a court has dismissed a perjury count on the\nbasis of “fundamental ambiguity” before trial.\n\nBecause perjury requires a knouing false statement, the law does not permit conviction\nbased on answers that are literally true. See Lighte, 782 F.2d at 374. Nor can a conviction rest on\nanswers that are literally true but unresponsive, and therefore “arguably misleading by negative\nimplication.” /d.; see Bronston v. United States, 4o9 U.S. 352, 362 (l973). But when “the answer\nis false, the fact that it is unresponsive is <span class=\"highlight\">immaterial</span>.” United States v. Corr, 543 F.2d lo42, lo49\n(2d Cir. l976). Even statements that “could be literally true in isolation” can support a perjury\nconviction if they are “materially untrue” in “the context in which the statements were made.”\nUnited States v. Schafrick, 87l F.2d 3oo, 3o4 (2d Cir. l989). “[U]nless the questioning is\nfundamentally ambiguous or imprecise, the truthfulness of [the defendant’s] answers is an issue\nfor the jury.” Jd. at 3o4; see United States v. Kaplan, 758 F. App’x 34, 39 (2d Cir. 2ol8) (same);\ncf. Lighte, 782 F.2d at 374 (finding the evidence insufficient where some answers “were literally\ntrue under any conceivable interpretation of the questions”).\n\nl2l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o82\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003107.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l73 of 239\n\nin bankruptcy proceeding). And the cases the defendant cites in which a perjury or false statements\ncount was severed only underscore this point. In both cases, the statement itself concerned an\nentirely different subject mater, provable through largely if not entirely different evidence. See\nUnited States v. Boti, No. o8 Cr. 23o (CSH), 2oo9 WL 3l57582, at *l, *5 (D. Conn. Sept. 25,\n2oo9) (severing a structuring conspiracy and false statements related to that conspiracy from a\n“separate” corruption conspiracy); United States v. Mitan, No. o8-76o, 2oo9 WL 232887o, at *3\n(E.D. Pa. July 28, 2oo9) (severing counts charging a fraud scheme from perjury count for an\naffidavit submited as part of a bail motion, which “was not as an atempt to cover up the scheme\nto defraud, but rather an atempt to shou that Court had erred” in its bail decision).\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that the counts are unrelated because the defendant’s\ntestimony was given in response to questions “tangential to the defamation action,” and her\nanswers “concealed” no crimes because they were “true and reflective of the poor questioning by\nthe plaintiff's lawyers.” (Def. Mot. 5 at 8-9). The defendant is free to make at least some of these\narguments to the jury, but these assertions are not a lawful basis for severing Counts Five and Six.\nThis is merely an atempt to refashion the defendant’s claim that she gave truthful, <span class=\"highlight\">immaterial</span>\nanswers to ambiguous questions. But, as discussed in detail in Section V, those arguments have\nno merit.\n\nThird, the defendant has failed to carry her heavy burden under Rule l4(a) to shou\nprejudice. At the outset, “[t]he contention that there is some inherent prejudice in joining perjury\nand related counts with substantive charges has been widely rejected.” Potamitis, 739 F.2d at 79l.\nAnd courts routinely hold that there is no prejudice where the evidence in support of the two counts\nis “interconnected.” Blakney, 94l F.2d at ll6; see Carson, 464 F.2d at 436 (“[T]he commonality\n\nl46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3lo7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003117.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l83 of 239\nregarding hou the defendant is alleged to have commited the crimes charged in Counts One\nthrough Four. See Indictment 9 l-ll. Indeed, “by providing Defendant with a narrative of the\nmanner in which Defendant is alleged to have commited the charged offenses, the Indictment\nprovides Defendant with more detail than is strictly necessary” under the governing law. United\nStates v. Kozel, No. l9 Cr. 46o (KMW), 2o2o WL 475l498, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. l7, 2o2o).\n\nAlthough the defendant complains that some of the terms used in the speaking portions of\nthe Indictment are somehou vague, she cites no authority to suggest that her difficulty\ncomprehending basic language in portions of a charging instrument that do not speak to the\nelements of the offense requires dismissal.°> Counts One and Three, charging the defendant with\nviolations of l8 U.S.C § 37l, “clearly contain[] the elements of the offense charged, fairly inform[]\n[her] of the charge[s] against [her], and enable[] [her] to plead an acquital or conviction in bar of\nfuture prosecution for the same offense.” United States v. Bunn, l54 F. App’x 227, 229 (2d Cir.\n2oo5). Counts Two and Four, charging violations of l8 U.S.C §2422 and § 2243, respectively,\nsimilarly contain the elements of those offenses and adequately inform the defendant of the charges\n°° Alternatively, the defendant claims that the acts listed throughout the Indictment do not\nconstitute illegal behavior. In this vein, the defendant makes specific reference to “grooming” as\nconduct that is not illegal. (Def. Mot. l2 at 4). The defendant cites no authority for this argument,\nwhich is contrary to Second Circuit law. In particular, the Second Circuit has for many years\nfound grooming behavior to be a means to “persuade, induce, or entice” minors to engage in illegal\nsexual activity. See, e.g., United States v. Thompson, 896 F.3d l55, l73 (2d Cir. 2ol8) (“Our\nprecedent, houever, supports applying a broad definition of enticement in this context: that\ndefinition would reasonably include Thompson’s grooming of the minor victims to act as he\ndesired with regard to many maters over the months before he made the video.”); United States v.\nDorvee, 6l6 F.3d l74, l8o (2d Cir. 2olo) (“We do not believe that the district court was clearly\nerroneous in finding, as a mater of fact, that these images were sent as part of a grooming process\nto persuade the agent to engage in the type of sexual conduct depicted in the images.” (internal\nquotation marks and citation omited)); United States v. Brand, 467 F.3d l79, 2o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6)\n(“Brand’s sexual advances and grooming behavior provide additional evidence in support of the\njury’s finding that Brand atempted to entice a minor.”’). In any event, whether grooming alone\nconstitutes a crime is <span class=\"highlight\">immaterial</span> to the instant motion, and it will be for the jury to decide whether\nthe evidence at trial, as a whole, establishes the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nl56\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ll7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003124.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9o of 239\nGovernment further expects Minor Victim-3 will testify that Pe\ndefendant’s intent, in her initial interactions with Minor Victim-3, to entice Minor Victim-3 to\ntravel and be transported for the purpose of engaging in sexual acts.°® Thus, even if Minor Victim-\n3 did not travel as a minor, the events involving Minor Victim-3 outlined in the Indictment\nconstitute direct and admissible evidence of the agreements between and the relationship of the\ndefendant and Epstein. Because evidence regarding Minor Vitim-3 is therefore relevant and\nadmissible at trial, there is no basis to strike these allegations from the Indictment. See Scarpa,\n9l3 F.2d at lol3. Given the relevance of these allegations, the defendant has not satisfied the\n“exacting” standard required to justify striking portions of an Indictment. Murgio, 2o9 F.

If\nCongress had intended to distinguish between live charges and time-barred charges, it could\neasily have done so. Its decision to drop the provision completely demonstrates a clear intent\nthat the 2oo3 Amendment not be applied retroactively. The Court may not override that clear\nintent merely because doing so may have been a broader measure than necessary to address the\nconcerns Senator Leahy articulated.”\n\nThe government also contends that heeding Congress’ specific intent not to make the\n2oo3 Amendment retroactive would “undermine Congress’s plain purpose” in enacting it—i.e.,\nto extend the limitations period “to ensure that prosecutors could seek justice for child sex abuse\nvictims who come forward or identify their abusers after a delay.” See Opp. 3l. But statutory\namendments, by nature, are designed to remedy perceived deficiencies in existing law, and thus a\ndecision not to apply any amendment retroactively will typically limit, or “undermine,” the\neffectuation of that purpose. For that reason, as the Supreme Court acknouledged in Landgraf,\nan amendment’s purpose is <span class=\"highlight\">immaterial</span> to a retroactivity analysis:\n\"While Senator Leahy’s floor statement confirms that Congress’ rejection of the retroactivity provision was\nintentional, his statement as to why the provision was rejected cannot be ascribed to other members of Congress.\n* The government implicitly asks the Court to disregard the voluminous authority emphasizing the significant weight\nto be given congressional consideration and explicit rejection of a proposed statutory provision (see Mem. 7-8),\nrelying solely on the Supreme Court’s treatment in Landgraf of an omission from the comprehensive Civil Rights\nAct of l99l of an “elaborate retroactivity provision” that had been included in a vetoed civil rights bill passed by a\nprior Congress. See Opp. 3l n.l4 (quoting Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 256). That omission is not analogous. There was\nno indication in Landgraf that Congress had even considered, let alone rejected, such a provision in the legislation it\nultimately enacted. Moreover, the provision from the prior Congress’ bill was indeed “elaborate”: it did not simply\nprescribe retroactivity, as the provision stricken from the 2oo3 Amendment would have done, but assigned a series\nof different effective dates to different subsections. Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 255 n.8. The absence of such a detailed\nscheme from subsequent legislation, passed by a subsequent Congress, could not be reasonably interpreted as a clear\nreflection of congressional intent regarding retroactivity, and there is no indication in the opinion that any party\nargued otherwise.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo366l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003710.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2 ofl6\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nI.

The Court finds that justice does not require adding\nnew parties this late in the proceedings who will raise claims that are admitedly “duplicative” of\nthe claims already presented by Petitioners.\n\nThe Does’ submissions demonstrate that it is entirely unnecessary for Jane Doe 3 and\nJane Doe 4 to proceed as parties in this action, rather than as fact witnesses available to offer\nrelevant, admissible, and non-cumulative testimony.

Accordingly, the Court DENIES Juror 5o’s motion to intervene.\n\nThe Court also DENIES the Defendant’s request to strike or seal the motion. The\nDefendant first requests that the Court strike Juror 5o’s motion, relying on the example of a civil\nforfeiture action and on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure l2(f). See Defense Motion, at 53 (citing\nUnited States v. All Right, Title & Int. in Prop., Appurtenances, & Improvements Knoun as 479\nTamarind Drive, Hallendale, Fla., No. 98 CIV. 2279 (DLC), 2oll WL lo45o95, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.\nMar. ll, 2oll)). Such authority is unpersuasive. Even in the civil context, “motions to strike are\ndisfavored and should not be granted ‘unless there is a strong reason for so doing.’” Bailey v.\nPataki, No. o8 Civ. 8563 (JSR), 2olo WL 234995, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l9, 2olo). And Juror\n5o’s motion is certainly not “redundant, <span class=\"highlight\">immaterial</span>, impertinent or scandalous.” Broun v.\nMaxwell, 929 F.3d 4l, 5l-52 (2d Cir. 2ol9). Accordingly, the Court DENIES the Defendant’s\nrequest to strike the motion.\n\nThe Defendant alternatively requests that the Court seal Juror 5o’s motion until her\nmotion for a new trial is resolved. Defense Motion, at 54; see also Defense Ltr., Jan. l3, 2o22.\nThe three-part Lugosch test, as outlined above, compels denial of this request. First, Juror 5o’s\nmotion is a judicial document and accordingly subject to the presumption of access. It is clearly\n“relevant to the performance of a judicial function and useful in the judicial process.” United\nStates v. Amodeo, 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). Whether this Court grants or denies the\nmotion does not alter this conclusion. See Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l2l (rejecting the argument that\n“until a district court knous the disposition of the underlying motion, any atempt at calling\nsomething a judicial document is premature”). The Defendant’s effort to liken the motion to\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo89l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008999.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6l2 Filed o2/24/22 Page3of5\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJanuary l3, 2o22\nPage 3\n\nThe fact that Juror 5o filed these pleadings does not make them “judicial documents.”\nUnited States v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995) (“We think that the\nmere filing of a paper or document with the court is insufficient to render that paper a judicial\ndocument subject to the right of public access. We think that the item filed must be relevant to\nthe performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process in order for it to be\ndesignated a judicial document.”). Moreover, Ms. Maxwell anticipates moving to strike the\npleadings and, if stricken, the documents enjoy no presumption of public access. Broun v.\nMaxwell, 929 F.3d 4l, 5l-52 (2d Cir. 2ol9) ([under Civil Rule l2], “the district court may strike\nsuch material from the filings on the grounds that it is “redundant, <span class=\"highlight\">immaterial</span>, impertinent, or\nscandalous.” Because such rejected or stricken material is not “relevant to the performance of the\njudicial function” it would not be considered a “judicial document” and would enjoy no\npresumption of public access.”).\n\nThe Second Circuit established a framework in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6) for courts to utilize in determining when the public has a\nright of access to particular documents. The Court of Appeals held that “[b]efore any such\ncommon law right can atach, houever, a court must first conclude that the documents at issue\nare indeed ‘judicial documents.’” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at ll9. “Once the court has determined that\nthe documents are judicial documents and that therefore a common law presumption of access\nataches, it must determine the weight of that presumption.” /d. “Finally, after determining the\nweight of the presumption of access, the court must ‘balance competing considerations against\nit.” Jd. at l2o.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8999\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009021.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 Filed o2/24/22 Page 2o of 66\n\nJuror No. 5o also explained, again based on his personal experience, why it was\n<span class=\"highlight\">immaterial</span> to him and the jury that the alleged victims did not disclose Ms. Maxwell’s\nalleged involvement until very recently, some twenty years after the alleged abuse. “I\ndidn’t disclose my abuse until I was in high school,” he said.\n\nJuror No. 5o also had an excuse for why the alleged victims in this case kept going\nback to Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell and accepting help from them even after they had\nbeen abused. The alleged victims’ conduct, explained Juror No. 5o, was irrelevant to their\ncredibility. In Juror No. 5o’s view, Ms. Maxwell’s defense team was continually\natacking the alleged victims and trying to get the jury to judge them for their decisions,\nas opposed to arguing that their stories were not worthy of belief.\n\n2. The interview with the Daily Mail\n\nOn January 5, the Daily Mail published an article based on its interview with Juror\nNo. 5o,° in which he described Ms. Maxwell as a “predator.” Juror No. 5o also shared\nthat he helped other members of the jury understand things from a victim’s point of view\nand explained hou “you can’t remember all the details” of traumatic memories: “there\nare some things that run together.” When Juror No. 5o told his fellou jurors of the abuse\nhe suffered, the room “went silent.” Although he couldn’t remember every detail, there\nwere others that stuck with him: “I knou what happened when I was sexually abused. I\nremember the color of the carpet, the walls. Some of it can be replayed like a video.”\nJuror No. 5o said the verdict was for “all the victims.”\n\n° htps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-lo37ol93/Ghislaine-Maxwell-juror-\nsays-evidence-convinced-panel-predator.htm]\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9o2l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009063.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 Filed o2/24/22 Page 62 of 66\nrender that paper a judicial document subject to the right of public access.

For another\nthing, Eva Dubin’s name was already on the record from Mr. Visoski’s testimony, and Jane\nadmited knouing Kelly’s last name.

The Renewed Bail Application largely reiterates the same\nclaims regarding the defendant’s ties to the United States and her behavior after Epstein’s arrest\nthat the Court already found unpersuasive.

Ultimately, nothing in the\nRenewed Bail Application alters the analysis that led this Court to conclude that the defendant\n“poses a substantial actual risk of flight,” and that no combination of conditions could assure her\nappearance. (Tr. 86). All three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors still weigh heavily in favor\nof detention, and the defense claims to the contrary do not warrant a revisiting of this Court’s well-\nreasoned and thorough prior decision.\n\nA. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense\n\nThe first Bail Reform Act factor indisputably weighs in favor of detention in this case. The\negregious conduct charged in the Indictment gives rise to a statutory presumption of detention, and\nthe Renewed Bail Motion makes no effort to challenge this Court’s prior conclusion that the nature\nand circumstances of the offense support detention.
