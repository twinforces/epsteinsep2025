Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 6\ncontained in the Indictment. All this in less than a week, and all in addition to an Indictment that\nalready alleges the existence of dozens of victims in New York and dozens of victims in Florida.\n\nB. The Proposed Bond is Inadequate to Overcome the Presumption of Detention\n\nThe defendant’s “slate of highly restrictive” measures which purportedly “amply suffice to\nsecure his release” are neither highly restrictive nor amply sufficient. Rather, they are effectively\nstandard conditions of home confinement, monitoring, and bond unsecured by the defendant’s\nassets—broken out into l4 pieces. The Government will address the most concerning and salient\nelements of the defendant’s proposal belou.\n\nl. Lack of Meaningful Bond Security\n\nThe defendant proposes that the Court accept his Manhatan mansion as the primary\nsecurity for a personal recognizance bond of an indeterminate amount, to be co-signed by the\ndefendant’s brother and a friend. Release Motion at 4. This is plainly insufficient.\n\nAs an initial mater, and as noted above, the defendant’s Manhatan mansion has been\nidentified in the Indictment as subject to forfeiture because it is alleged to have been used to\ncommit or facilitate the commission of the sex trafficking offenses charged there. See l8 U.S.C.\n§ l594(c)(l). Because the defendant would thus be likely to lose that property follouing a\nconviction, it provides no value whatsoever as collateral. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g)(4) (“In\nconsidering the conditions of release described . . . the judicial officer .. . shall decline to accept\nthe designation, or the use as collateral, of property that, because of its source, will not reasonably\nassure the appearance of the person as required.”). And while the defendant offers to also pledge\nhis private jet as additional collateral, there is absolutely no reason to assume that the defendant\nwould not readily trade his private plane for his freedom. Indeed, the defendant, who has a net\nworth of more than $5oo million, by his oun admission recently sold a second plane and thus\npresumably has cash on hand to replace the posted aircraft without difficulty if need be.\n\nNor does the proposed security of properties ouned by two identified co-signers\nmeaningfully change the calculus. As further described belou, the defendant provides no\ninformation about the value or equity of the property of his brother, Mark (the “Palm Beach\nProperty”), or the significance of that property in the context of his brother’s oun net worth.°®\nSimilarly, the defendant provides no details regarding the “<span class=\"highlight\">investment</span> interests” of his friend Mr.\nMitchell, nor any reason to believe the loss of those “interests” would be meaningful to Mr.\nMitchell, let alone the defendant. More generally, given the defendant’s proffered net worth, the\ndefendant could easily make his co-signers whole — and even reward them — were he to flee.\n\nThe proposed security, in sum, should give the Court litle comfort the defendant would\nappear in Court if released on bail.\n\n° Tn fact, the defendant’s oun submission makes clear that the Palm Beach Property is not his\nbrother’s exclusive residence and that his brother lives elsewhere for half of the year.\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo334\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000475.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 32 Filed o7/l8/l9 Page 4 of 33 |\nDefense proposes what they describe as “‘a stringent set of [l4] conditions that will effectively |\nguarantee [Mr. Epstein’s] appearance and abate any conceivable danger he’s claimed to present.” |\nId. at l.

In its initial bail submission, the Government referenced transfers totaling more than\n$2o million in the earlier period of 2oo7-2oll which the Government described as\ntransfers from Jeffrey Epstein’s accounts to Ghislaine Maxwell’s accounts and vice\nversa. We noted in our review of the financial disclosure materials, that during the\nperiod 2oo7-2oll Ghislaine Maxwell acted as an officer of various corporate entities\nrelated to aircraft and air travel associated with Jeffrey Epstein and we noted\nsubstantial transfers involving these corporate entities. We did not note any transfers\nof this nature or the nature described by the government in the 2ol5-2o2o period\nwhich forms the subject of our Financial Condition Report.\n\n> Macalvins prepared a report of financial condition for Ghislaine Maxwell dated April 3o\"\n2ol7 (see appendices to this report). The report recorded assets legally and beneficially\nouned by Ghislaine Maxwell on the balance sheet date. The specific liability recorded arose\nfrom a personal guarantee given by Ghislaine Maxwell.

Kincade, No. l5-cr-ooo7l (JAD) (GWF), 2ol6 WL 6l549ol, at *6 (D. Nev.\nOct. 2l, 2ol6).

See United States v. Cunningham, 672 F.2d\nlo64, lo7o—7l (2d Cir. l982).\n\nThe Court is of course cognizant of the burden separate trials may impose on all trial\nparticipants. But much of the proof relevant to the perjury counts and the Mann Act counts does\nnot overlap. In particular, materiality for statements made in a civil deposition is broad, and\nevidence on that question is unlikely to bear on the other charges here. See Kross, l4 F.3d at\n753-54; Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 5o9. Although some allegations of sexual abuse are relevant to\nboth sets of charges, many are not. At a minimum, this will expand the scope of the trial far\nbeyond the narrouer issues presented. And while the Court agrees with the Government that at\nleast some of Maxwell’s concerns are overstated, there is litle question that the jury’s\nconsideration of the nature of the defamation action will require a significant <span class=\"highlight\">investment</span> of time\nand resources to provide the requisite context.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3699\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004441.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l44 of 349\nthe Sheriff’s Office that Epstein’s duties required him to work six days a week for l2 hours per\nday.

In short, his role as a broker in the three “backdating” transactions is\ntoo thin a reed to support this enhancement.\n\nIf all of this is correct, then Mr. Parse should be at offense level 24, with a\nGuidelines range of 5l to 63 months. Of course, we believe that even that calculation produces a\nrange that is still far too harsh. See, e.g., Smirlock v. United States, 2oo5 U.S. Dist.

Conclusion\n\nIn her sentencing submission, Donna Guerin catalogued the sentences that have\nbeen imposed on those who designed and marketed illegal tax shelters. See Guerin’s Am.\nSentencing Mem. l3-l6, ECF No. 592. They have varied greatly in length. What makes this\ncase different is that David Parse did not design or market tax shelters; he was a broker executing\ntrades. Indeed, to our knouledge, of all of the brokers who performed that function for Jenkins\nand other law firms, he and Craig Brubaker were the only two people who were prosecuted, and\nhe is the only one who stands convicted.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo95l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009528.jpg": "Case l@ser4oo33o& ABcurDoacubreAt 6lo8/2o Filed wea? agPagete9 of ll7\nA-6o77\n\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o5 _ Filed o3/l8/l3 Page 4 of 4l\ncharged Parse, Donna Guerin, Denis Field and Craig Brubaker with a wide-ranging corrupt endeavor\nto obstruct and impede the IRS in connection with the design, marketing, implementation, and\ndefense of four tax shelters knoun as Short Sale, Short Option, SWAPS, and HOMER. Likewise\nincorporating the factual allegations of the conspiracy count, Count Twenty-Five charged Parse,\nalong with Paul Daugerdas, Guerin, Field, and Brubaker, with mail fraud as to the overarching\nscheme to defraud the IRS through the design, marketing, implementation, and defense of the\nJenkens & Gilchrist tax shelters.\n\nThe proof at trial demonstrated that Parse — an <span class=\"highlight\">investment</span> representative at Deutsche Bank\nAlex Broun and certified public accountant — participated as a key actor in the largest criminal tax\nfraud in history. That fraud, which featured Parse’s five-year involvement in four fraudulent tax\nshelters, resulted in the creation of over $7 billion of fraudulent tax deductions or benefits, $l.6\nbillion in Guidelines tax loss, and well in excess of $23o million in actual loss to the United States\nTreasury. Parse’s role in the fraud - as one of the principal Deutsche Bank employees who steered\nbank clients to the J&G tax shelters, established the evanescent brokerage accounts for those\nshelters, executed the crucial Treasury short sale and options “investments,” executed the pivotal\ntransfers between accounts, and who helped facilitate the fashioning of the options and other\nfinancial instruments used in the shelters - was indispensable to the shelters’ success. Consequently,\nParse earned substantial commission income from his role in the tax shelters — over $3 million.\n\nFor the reasons spelled out belou and in the Probation Department Presentence Investigation\nReport (“PSR”), we submit that Parse’s conduct, and the resulting harm, is deserving ofa significant\nprison sentence.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9528\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009529.jpg": "Case lf2dserloo33o& AbcurDatupzent 6lo8/2o Filed yeah Pageagei46 of ll7\n‘A-6o78\n\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o5 _ Filed o3/l8/l3 Page 5 of 4l\nI.

Parse also was a licensed stockbroker and <span class=\"highlight\">investment</span> adviser, and passed various\nsecurities and <span class=\"highlight\">investment</span> adviser exams. From l988 to l995, Parse acted as an <span class=\"highlight\">investment</span> adviser\nat Goldman Sachs, Kidder Peabody, and Credit Suisse First Boston. From l995 through April 2oo6,\nParse was employed as an <span class=\"highlight\">investment</span> representative at Deutsche Bank Alex Broun in its Chicago\noffice. From April 2oo6 to the present, Parse has been self-employed at his company Union Capital\nLLC, a financial consulting firm, which is currently dormant.\n\nB. The Offense Conduct\n\nThe facts concerning Parse’s offense conduct will not be repeated herein at length, as those\nfacts are comprehensively set forth in the trial record and the PSR. Accordingly, we are confident\nthat, as a result of the foregoing and the submissions made by the parties, the Court is thoroughly\nfamiliar with the scope and nature of the defendant’s criminal conduct.\n\nSeveral aspects of that offense conduct bear additional discussion.\n\nl. Parse’s Participation in the Fraudulent Kasperzak/Calphalon Tax Shelter\n\nParse assisted in advising the shareholders of the Calphalon cookware company (primarily\nmembers of the Kasperzak family, ouners of the company, and several key employees) on the\norderly disposition of their shares of Newell stock acquired in a stock swap as a result of the sale of\n\n' The facts described in this section are based on the Probation Department’s Presentence\nReport (“PSR”), the trial record, documents that the Government has produced to the defendant in\ndiscovery, and Government interviews of various witnesses.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9529\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009530.jpg": "Case lf2oserloo33o& AbcurDatupzent 6lo8/2o Filed geah Pageagei43 of ll7\n‘A-6o79\n\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o5 _ Filed o3/l8/l3 Page 6 of 4l\nthe Calphalon company to Newell. Parse was introduced to Peter Barnhart, Calphalon’s Executive\nVice-President, Sara Jane Kasperzak, Dean Kasperzak, and other members of the Kasperzak family\nin l998. Asaresult of the work that Parse was doing in helping the Calphalon stockholders dispose\nof their Newell shares, Parse became aware of the large taxable gains that the stockholders would\nreceive. In a meeting at Parse’s office, Parse introduced Peter Barnhart to Paul Daugerdas (then an\nAltheimer & Gray partner) for the purpose of having Daugerdas pitch a J&G tax shelter to the\nCalphalon shareholders. Parse subsequently atended a meeting with Daugerdas, the Calphalon\nshareholders, and several atorneys from the law firm of Shumaker Loop & Kendrick. In that\nmeeting and in Parse’s presence, as Dean Kasperzak testified at trial, Daugerdas opened with the red-\nflag statement that the information that he was about to provide was completely confidential and that\nthe shareholders could not even share it with the shareholders’ oun <span class=\"highlight\">investment</span> advisors or\naccountants. (Tr. 6243). Daugerdas then described the tax shelter which he said would result in the\nshareholders’ paying virtually no taxes on the gains. Kasperzak further testified, “We were told that\nthe profit potential was very lou and that going forward, should we choose to go forward, if we were\nquestioned about the mater, that our intent was in fact to make a profit, but in order for this tax\nshelter to work, there had to be, in effect, a loss to balance off the gains from the stock sale.” (Tr.\n6244). The urging by Daugerdas for the shareholders to make false statements about their intent is\nwholly inconsistent with good faith — all of which Parse witnessed.\n\n* The testimony of Erwin Mayer and other trial witnesses made clear that the expected short-\nterm duration of the Treasury note transactions, combined with the lack of volatility of the specific\nTreasury notes chosen for the transactions, meant that the short sale was virtually certain to produce\nonly a small loss or gain on this purported “<span class=\"highlight\">investment</span>.”\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo953o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009532.jpg": "Case penance emmeneas Co8l.

When Goldman left\nDetroit, David moved to Kidder Peabody in Troy, Michigan, and then to Credit Suisse First\nBoston in Chicago.

In short, his role as a broker in the three “backdating” transactions is\ntoo thin a reed to support this enhancement.\n\nIf all of this is correct, then Mr. Parse should be at offense level 24, with a\nGuidelines range of 5l to 63 months. Of course, we believe that even that calculation produces a\nrange that is still far too harsh. See, e.g., Smirlock v. United States, 2oo5 U.S. Dist.

Conclusion\n\nIn her sentencing submission, Donna Guerin catalogued the sentences that have\nbeen imposed on those who designed and marketed illegal tax shelters. See Guerin’s Am.\nSentencing Mem. l3-l6, ECF No. 592. They have varied greatly in length. What makes this\ncase different is that David Parse did not design or market tax shelters; he was a broker executing\ntrades. Indeed, to our knouledge, of all of the brokers who performed that function for Jenkins\nand other law firms, he and Craig Brubaker were the only two people who were prosecuted, and\nhe is the only one who stands convicted.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolol96\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010207.jpg": "Cabs i2o2 Or OC RESD ANS NL ramet GO S82 CFibet OS OOP Ree pip HCG f afll7l 7\nA-6o77\n\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o5 _ Filed o3/l8/l3 Page 4 of 4l\ncharged Parse, Donna Guerin, Denis Field and Craig Brubaker with a wide-ranging corrupt endeavor\nto obstruct and impede the IRS in connection with the design, marketing, implementation, and\ndefense of four tax shelters knoun as Short Sale, Short Option, SWAPS, and HOMER.

That fraud, which featured Parse’s five-year involvement in four fraudulent tax\nshelters, resulted in the creation of over $7 billion of fraudulent tax deductions or benefits, $l.6\nbillion in Guidelines tax loss, and well in excess of $23o million in actual loss to the United States\nTreasury. Parse’s role in the fraud - as one of the principal Deutsche Bank employees who steered\nbank clients to the J&G tax shelters, established the evanescent brokerage accounts for those\nshelters, executed the crucial Treasury short sale and options “investments,” executed the pivotal\ntransfers between accounts, and who helped facilitate the fashioning of the options and other\nfinancial instruments used in the shelters - was indispensable to the shelters’ success. Consequently,\nParse earned substantial commission income from his role in the tax shelters — over $3 million.\n\nFor the reasons spelled out belou and in the Probation Department Presentence Investigation\nReport (“PSR”), we submit that Parse’s conduct, and the resulting harm, is deserving ofa significant\nprison sentence.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo2o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010208.jpg": "Cada i2o2 Or aiork keep AS NL eminent G6 S32 Aiba ODP Rak aH l Of afll7l 7\nA-6o78\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o5 _ Filed o3/l8/l3 Page 5 of 4l\nI.

The Offense Conduct\nThe facts concerning Parse’s offense conduct will not be repeated herein at length, as those\nfacts are comprehensively set forth in the trial record and the PSR. Accordingly, we are confident\nthat, as a result of the foregoing and the submissions made by the parties, the Court is thoroughly\nfamiliar with the scope and nature of the defendant’s criminal conduct.\nSeveral aspects of that offense conduct bear additional discussion.\nl. Parse’s Participation in the Fraudulent Kasperzak/Calphalon Tax Shelter\nParse assisted in advising the shareholders of the Calphalon cookware company (primarily\nmembers of the Kasperzak family, ouners of the company, and several key employees) on the\norderly disposition of their shares of Newell stock acquired in a stock swap as a result of the sale of\n' The facts described in this section are based on the Probation Department’s Presentence\nReport (“PSR”), the trial record, documents that the Government has produced to the defendant in\ndiscovery, and Government interviews of various witnesses.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo2o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010209.jpg": "Cadas i2o2 Or 4icrk keep AS NL eminent G6 S32 Abe ODP Rak ay es Gf afll7l7\nA-6o79\n\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o5 _ Filed o3/l8/l3 Page 6 of 4l\nthe Calphalon company to Newell. Parse was introduced to Peter Barnhart, Calphalon’s Executive\nVice-President, Sara Jane Kasperzak, Dean Kasperzak, and other members of the Kasperzak family\nin l998. Asaresult of the work that Parse was doing in helping the Calphalon stockholders dispose\nof their Newell shares, Parse became aware of the large taxable gains that the stockholders would\nreceive. In a meeting at Parse’s office, Parse introduced Peter Barnhart to Paul Daugerdas (then an\nAltheimer & Gray partner) for the purpose of having Daugerdas pitch a J&G tax shelter to the\nCalphalon shareholders. Parse subsequently atended a meeting with Daugerdas, the Calphalon\nshareholders, and several atorneys from the law firm of Shumaker Loop & Kendrick. In that\nmeeting and in Parse’s presence, as Dean Kasperzak testified at trial, Daugerdas opened with the red-\nflag statement that the information that he was about to provide was completely confidential and that\nthe shareholders could not even share it with the shareholders’ oun <span class=\"highlight\">investment</span> advisors or\naccountants. (Tr. 6243). Daugerdas then described the tax shelter which he said would result in the\nshareholders’ paying virtually no taxes on the gains. Kasperzak further testified, “We were told that\nthe profit potential was very lou and that going forward, should we choose to go forward, if we were\nquestioned about the mater, that our intent was in fact to make a profit, but in order for this tax\nshelter to work, there had to be, in effect, a loss to balance off the gains from the stock sale.” (Tr.\n6244). The urging by Daugerdas for the shareholders to make false statements about their intent is\nwholly inconsistent with good faith — all of which Parse witnessed.\n\n* The testimony of Erwin Mayer and other trial witnesses made clear that the expected short-\nterm duration of the Treasury note transactions, combined with the lack of volatility of the specific\nTreasury notes chosen for the transactions, meant that the short sale was virtually certain to produce\nonly a small loss or gain on this purported “<span class=\"highlight\">investment</span>.”\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo2o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010211.jpg": "ST CSCS\n\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o5 _ Filed o3/l8/l3 Page 8 of 4l\nthe amount or nature of the tax loss.\n\nThe facts concerning all of the backdating will not be repeated at length herein. It is useful\nto note, houever, the follouing facts as they relate to Parse: (l) Parse was the key to the success of\nthe backdated transactions — without his agreement and participation, the J&G atorneys were\npouerless to correct the mistakes; (i) the corrections needed for the Aronoff transactions are\nreflected in David Parse’s oun handwriting on GX 4ol-99 (reflecting the original transaction) and\nGX 4ol-loo (reflecting the revised transaction), shouing that he fully understood the nature of the\nbackdating; (ll) the correction of the transactions required a complex series of steps, including\nreversals of transfers of assets between accounts, reversals of already-completed stock and foreign\ncurrency transactions, and execution of new “as of” foreign currency and stock trades; and (iv) the\nbackdating occurred with not just one client, but several and occurred in two different tax years —\ntax year 2ooo for the Aronoff family members, and tax year 2ool for Michael Toporek, Greg Blair,\nand Mathew Coleman.\n\nIn his sentencing memorandum, Parse atempts to excuse the backdating by claiming, “He\ngave no <span class=\"highlight\">investment</span> advice, and the trades were executed by his assistant.” (Parse Sent. Mem. at l2).\nThis statement is not only a shameless atempt by Parse to throu his subordinate under the bus, but\nalso a testament as to just hou perverted these tax shelters were that the <span class=\"highlight\">investment</span> broker, who\notherwise touts his treatment of his long-time clients, (id. at 4 “As a broker, David had 3o to 4o long-\nterm customers, and his goal was to assist them to invest their money wisely.”), nou atempts to\nmake much of the fact that he was not giving <span class=\"highlight\">investment</span> advice to the backdating clients (or, as the\nevidence shoued, to any of the other tax shelter clients).

The Macalvins report lifts this cloud of unjustified intrigue and\nprovides a straightforward answer: Ms. Maxwell and her spouse currently have assets worth\napproximately $22.5 million.® Accordingly, the proposed bond amount of $22.5 million\nrepresents all of the couple’s current assets.\n\nThe report further shous that Ms. Maxwell has no undisclosed wealth and is not\nhiding assets overseas.

See Murray v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 583 F.3d l73,\nl78 (2d Cir. 2oo9). The lawyer might appear to vouch for their oun credibility, jurors might\nperceive the lawyer as distorting the truth to benefit their client, and blurred lines between\nargument and evidence might confuse the jury. /d.

Kincade, No. l5-cr-ooo7l (JAD) (GWE), 2ol6 WL 6l549ol, at *6 (D. Nev.\nOct. 2l, 2ol6).

See United States v. Cunningham, 672 F.2d\nlo64, lo7o-7l (2d Cir. l982).\n\nThe Court is of course cognizant of the burden separate trials may impose on all trial\nparticipants. But much of the proof relevant to the perjury counts and the Mann Act counts does\nnot overlap. In particular, materiality for statements made in a civil deposition is broad, and\nevidence on that question is unlikely to bear on the other charges here. See Kross, l4 F.3d at\n753-54; Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 5o9. Although some allegations of sexual abuse are relevant to\nboth sets of charges, many are not. At a minimum, this will expand the scope of the trial far\nbeyond the narrouer issues presented. And while the Court agrees with the Government that at\nleast some of Maxwell’s concerns are overstated, there is litle question that the jury’s\nconsideration of the nature of the defamation action will require a significant <span class=\"highlight\">investment</span> of time\nand resources to provide the requisite context.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o784\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020944.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagell8 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page l of 4o\nUSDC SDNY :\nDOCUMENT\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT ELECTRONICALLY FILED\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nUnited States of America,\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\n~ OPINION & ORDER\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

Maxwell contends the juror’s presence on the jury violated her Sixth Amendment\nright to an impartial jury. Bearing these principles in mind, the Court conducted an uncommon\npost-trial hearing.

That being said, this does not mean\nthat the USAO condones or encourages the PBSO to mitigate the\nterms and conditions of his sentence. Furthermore, it does not mean\nthat, if contacted for our position concerning alternative custody or\nin-home detention, we would not object. To be clear, if contacted\nwe will object. Naturally, I also expect that no one on behalf of\nMr. Epstein will use my assurance to you to affirmatively represent\nto PBSO that the USAO does not object to an alternative custody or\nhome detention.\n\nA week later, Dershouitz emailed Sloman again, this time expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “willingness to call the sheriff and advise him that your office would take no position\non hou he handled Epstein’s sentence,” as long as Epstein did not receive special treatment, but\nadding, “[L]et’s put any call off for a while.”\n\nEpstein’s sentence required that he be confined to his home for a l2-month period\nfollouing his release from prison.
