In addition to l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d), prosecutors also proposed\nthat the defendant could plead guilty to l8 U.S.C. § 4o3, that is, a knouing or intentional violation\nof the privacy protection of child victims and child witnesses, to which the defendant’s then-\ncounsel replied: “Already thinking about the same statutes.” Jd. Dkt. 36l-ll. They also discussed\na possible obstruction plea that “could rely on the incident where Mr. Epstein’s private\ninvestigators folloued [redacted] father, forcing off the road.” /d. Dkt. 36l-lo.\n\nThe defendant’s apparent previous willingness to obstruct a federal investigation, harass or\ntamper with witnesses, and hire private investigators that “forc/ed] off the road” the father of an\nindividual relevant in the investigation is alarming. It should especially weigh on the Court’s\nconsideration here because the defendant was apparently willing to take those steps before even\nbeing charged and thus facing federal indictment; the incentive to interfere in the Government’s\ncase here, where an Indictment has been returned, is exponentially greater. And as discussed\nabove, the defendant has nearly limitless means to do so.\n\nFinally, despite having been previously convicted of a sex offense involving an underage\nvictim, the defendant has continued to maintain a vast trove of lewd photographs of young-looking\nwomen or girls in his Manhatan mansion. In a search of the New York Residence on the night of\nhis arrest, on July 6-7, 2ol9, pursuant to judicially-authorized warrants, law enforcement officers\ndiscovered not only specific evidence consistent with victim <span class=\"highlight\">recollections</span> of the inside of the\nmansion, further strengthening the evidence of the conduct charged in the Indictment, but also at\nleast hundreds—and perhaps thousands—of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-\nnude females. While these items were only seized this weekend and are still being reviewed, some\nof the nude or partially-nude photographs appear to be of underage girls, including at least one girl\nwho, according to her counsel, was underage at the time the relevant photographs were taken.\nAdditionally, some of the photographs referenced herein were discovered in a locked safe, in which\nlaw enforcement officers also found compact discs with hand-writen labels including the\nfollouing: “Young [Name] + [Name],” “Misc nudes l,” and “Girl pics nude.” The defendant, a\nregistered sex offender, is not reformed, he is not chastened, he is not repentant;® rather, he is a\ncontinuing danger to the community and an individual who faces devastating evidence supporting\ndeeply serious charges.\n> The redactions above are contained in the publicly filed version of the quoted document.\n® See, e. g., Amber Southerland, Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein: I’m a sex offender, not a predator,\nN.Y.

Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nWe respectfully submit this leter to bring to the Court’s atention the recent decision by\nthe Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. William Henry Cosby\nJr., J-loo-2o2o (Jun. 3o, 2o2l), in which the Court vacated Mr. Cosby’s conviction and sentence\nbecause the District Atorney’s Office that prosecuted him failed to live up to its express promise\nnot to prosecute Mr. Cosby for the same crimes for which he was later convicted.! Ms. Maxwell’s\ncase presents a similar situation. As we argued in our supplemental pretrial motions currently\npending before the Court (Dkt. 293), the government has failed to abide by its promise not to\nprosecute Ms. Maxwell for the offenses for which she was immunized by the Epstein Non-\nProsecution Agreement (“NPA”). We submit that this decision provides support for Ms.\nMaxwell’s supplemental motion to dismiss Counts One, Three, Five, and Six of the S2 Indictment\nfor violation of the NPA.\n\nIn Cosby, Andrea Constand alleged that Mr. Cosby sexually assaulted her in his residence\nin January 2oo4. (Op. 4-5). Ms. Constand did not immediately report the assault to law\nenforcement authorities and continued to have contact with Mr. Cosby in the follouing months.\n(Id. at 5-7). In January 2oo5, approximately one year after the assault, Ms. Constand reported Mr.\nCosby’s conduct to the police. (/d. at 6). The Montgomery County District Atorney’s Office\ninvestigated the allegations, but then-District Atorney Bruce Castor determined that “there was\ninsufficient credible and admissible evidence” to bring criminal charges against Mr. Cosby. (/d. at\n7-lo). Among the factors weighing against bringing charges were that (l) Ms. Constand had\nwaited a year to file her complaint, which diminished the reliability of Ms. Constand’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">recollections</span>; (i) Ms. Constand’s statements about the events were inconsistent; (il) there was a\nlack of corroborating evidence; (iv) Ms. Constand continued to speak to and meet with Mr. Cosby\n! The opinion (“Op.”) is atached to this leter as Exhibit A.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004822.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page lo of 8o\nhad sexual intercourse on any occasion. Cosby admited that he told Constand and her\nmother that he would write doun the name of the pills and provide them that information,\nbut he acknouledged that he never actually did so. After the interview—and without being\nasked to do so—Cosby provided the police with pills, which laboratory testing confirmed\nto be Benadryl.\n\nIn February 2oo5, then-District Atorney Castor reviewed Constand’s interviews\nand Cosby’s writen answers in order to assess the viability of a prosecution of Cosby.\nThe fact that Constand had failed to promptly file a complaint against Cosby troubled the\ndistrict atorney. In D.A. Castor’s view, such a delay diminished the reliability of any\n<span class=\"highlight\">recollections</span> and undermined the investigators’ efforts to collect forensic evidence.\nMoreover, D.A. Castor identified a number of inconsistences in Constand’s various\nstatements to investigators. After Cosby provided his writen answers, police officers\nsearched his Cheltenham residence and found no evidence that, in their view, could be\nused to confirm or corroborate Constand’s allegations. Follouing the search of Cosby’s\nhome, Constand was interviewed by police again. D.A. Castor noted that there were\ninconsistences in that interview, which further impaired Constand’s credibility in his eyes.\nHe also learned that, before she contacted the police in Canada, Constand had contacted\ncivil atorneys in Philadelphia, likely for the purpose of pursuing financial compensation in\na lawsuit against Cosby.\n\nAdditionally, according to D.A. Castor, Constand’s behavior in the year since the\nalleged assault complicated any effort to secure a conviction against Cosby. As\nevidenced by the number of telephone calls that she recorded, Constand continued to\ntalk with Cosby on the phone, and she also continued to meet with him in person after\nthe incident. D.A.

Contemporaneous flight records would\nhave offered the best possible evidence to shou exactly when accusers traveled. The only such\nrecords admited at trial were the flight logs kept by David Rodgers, which were incomplete and\noften identified passengers simply by their first names or generic identifiers like “l female” or “l\nmale.” Rodgers and Larry Visoski testified that the passenger manifests also contained\ninformation about the names of the passengers on the flights. Tr. l8l9; l7l-73. Because of the\npassage of time, houever, the flight manifests did not go back to the time period charged in the\nIndictment.\n\nOf particular interest were entries in Rodgers’ flight logs which shoued that someone\nwith Jane’s true first name was a passenger on two flights when Jane was l6 years old — one to\nNew York on November ll, l996, and another to Santa Fe, New Mexico on May 9, l997.\nHouever, because only the first name was listed, the flight logs did not conclusively establish\nthat it was Jane on those flights. Had the passenger manifests been available, the defense could\nhave used them to challenge whether Jane was on those flights as well as the accuracy of Jane’s\nrecollection of events.\n\nSimilarly, Cimberly Espinosa testified that Epstein often had his assistants buy\ncommercial plane tickets for people and that they used a travel service called Shoppers Travel to\nbook them. Tr. 2349. Annie Farmer testified that Epstein bought her a commercial ticket to fly\nto New Mexico in the spring of l996, which was the trip where she claimed she was given a\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8955", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009603.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 4lof5l\ninquired about Epstein’s residences in an effort to cast doubt on Jane’s <span class=\"highlight\">recollections</span> of events. In\naddition, the defendant listed as a defense witness one employee who worked for Epstein in his\nNew York residence at East 7l“ Street in the mid-l99os, but tellingly elected to not call that\nwitness. (Def. Dec. l4, 2o2l Leter to Court). The defendant also cites the absence of Sally\nMarkham, claiming that she “could have testified that the household manual [Government Exhibit\n6o6] was not created by Ms. Maxwell, but by another individual knoun as ‘the Countess,’ whom\nEpstein brought in to ‘professionalize’ his staff.” (Def. Mot. at 3o). The defendant conveniently\nignores Alessi’s testimony about the manual (Tr. 8o7-o9) and Government Exhibit 424, an email\nchain in which the defendant and Markham discussed the household manual, which made\nabundantly clear that the defendant was involved in developing the manual. The defendant’s bald\nassertions about Markham’s testimony are speculative and belied by the trial record. Finally, the\ndefendant’s musings about what Fontanilla “could have testified” about (Def. Mot. at 3o)—the\ndetails of which are sparse—do not “demonstrate a substantial, actual prejudice to [her] ability to\ndefend [herself].” Long, 697 F. Supp. at 657. Even assuming that Fontanilla would have testified\nas the defendant nou contends, such testimony would also have no bearing on whether the abuse,\nin fact, occurred.\n\nIn sum, the defendant “fail[s] to identify what [these] witnesses would have atested to had\nthe case been brought sooner; [she] fail[s] to substantiate the proposition that the testimony would\nhave been favorable to [her]; and [she] fail[s] to provide any proof to support [her] claims of actual\nand substantial prejudice.” United States v. Berry, No. 2o Cr. 84 (AJN), 2o2l WL 2665585, at *3\n(S.D.N.Y.

The Government also expects that one or more victims will exercise their right to be\nheard at the July l4, 2o2o hearing in this mater, and will urge the Court not to grant bail. More\ngenerally, as noted above, the Government is deeply concerned that if the defendant is bailed, the\nvictims will be denied justice in this case. That outcome is unacceptable to both the victims and\nthe Government.\nIl. The Government’s Case Is Strong\n\nThe defendant’s motion argues, in a conclusory fashion, that the Government’s case must\nbe weak because the conduct charged occurred in the l99os. That argument, which ignores the\nmany specific allegations in the Indictment, could not be more wrong. As the superseding\nindictment (the “Indictment”) makes plain, multiple victims have provided detailed, credible\nevidence of the defendant’s criminal conduct. And while that conduct did take place a number of\nyears ago, it is unsurprising that the victims have been unable to forget the defendant’s predatory\nconduct after all this time, as traumatic childhood experiences often leave indelible marks. The\n<span class=\"highlight\">recollections</span> of the victims bear striking resemblances that corroborate each other and provide\ncompelling proof of the defendant’s active participation in a disturbing scheme to groom and\nsexually abuse minor girls. In addition to compelling victim accounts, as the Government has\nexplained, the victims’ accounts are corroborated by documentary evidence and other witnesses.\n\nIn particular, the victims’ accounts are supported by contemporaneous documents and\nrecords, such as flight records, diary entries, and business records.

Under, the Bail Reform Act, a defendant must be released\nunless there are “no conditions” that would reasonably assure her presence. Here, the proposed\npackage satisfies the actual governing standard, and the Court should grant bail.\nARGUMENT\n\nI. The Government Concedes that Its Case Relies Almost Exclusively on the\n\nTestimony of Three Witnesses\n\nIn evaluating the strength of the government’s case in its prior ruling, the Court relied on\nthe government’s proffer that the testimony of the three accusers would be corroborated by\n“significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Tr. 82 (emphasis added)). The\ngovernment nou expressly retreats from this position. It is abundantly clear from the\ngovernment’s response that it has no “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence”—in\nfact, it has virtually no documentary corroboration at all—and that its case against Ms. Maxwell\nis based almost exclusively on the <span class=\"highlight\">recollections</span> of the three accusers, who remain unidentified,\nconcerning events that took place over 25 years ago. Moreover, the government offers no\nspecificity about when within the four-year period of the charged conspiracy the alleged\nincidents of abuse took place. This, alone, is grounds for the Court to reconsider its prior ruling.\n\nThe few examples of documentary corroboration referenced by the government—which\nare the same examples that the government touted at the initial bail hearing—pertain to Epstein,\nnot Ms. Maxwell. The government concedes tha ie\nee\nPp orrrr—‘i—sSSCSsS (Gov. Mem. at ll (emphasis added)). The\ngovernment further states that\ni\n(emphasis added)). The strength of the government’s case against Jeffrey Epstein is not at issue\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2olo9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020110.jpg": "CaSede2otepQd36ouAdnnt Bo cutrent! lo22 lFiled32728/2o9 dgef 7l Gb l5\n\nhere. Whether or not the accusers’ <span class=\"highlight\">recollections</span> as to Epstein are corroborated is irrelevant to\nthe strength of the evidence against Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThe only purported corroboration that pertains in any way to Ms. Maxwell is of marginal\nvalue. The government references rrr\n| | (/d. at ll). But even the government concedes that, at best,\nCiS\n\nIt is clear that the only evidence that Ms. Maxwell allegedly “groomed” the accusers or\nknouingly facilitated or participated in Epstein’s sexual abuse of minors will come solely from\nthe testimony of the three accusers. The government’s case against Ms. Maxwell therefore rests\nentirely on the credibility and reliability of these three witnesses. Moreover, the substantive\ncounts (Counts Two and Four) are based on the testimony of only one witness, Minor Victim-l.\nIt is also telling that the government does not even atempt to rebut the defense’s assertion that it\ndid not begin issuing subpoenas for documents related to Ms. Maxwell until just after the death\nof Jeffrey Epstein. This confirms that the case against Ms. Maxwell was assembled after the fact\n' The government also proffers that they will have “additional witnesses.” (Gov. Mem. at ll). But these are not\n“outcry” witnesses who will corroborate a contemporaneous account of abuse from one or more of the accusers.\nInstead, they will testify only that “both [Ms. Maxwell] and Epstein knew and interacted with certain minor victims\nwhen those victims were minors.” (/d.). Again, the fact that Ms. Maxwell may have “met and interacted with”\nsomeone when they were a minor proves absolutely nothing.\n* One of the witnesses has submited a leter to the Court. While the CVRA permits the right to be heard, the leter\nshould be given no legal weight in the Court’s bail analysis. See United States v. Turner, 367 F. Supp. 2d 3l9, 33l-\n32 (E.D.N.Y. 2oo5)\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ollo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020136.jpg": "CaGade2o epQ)o36Go4AUNt Dib Suitentl l2G2 lF iG 3228o/2o9 Paget J Gb 22\nany person or the community posed by pre-trial release. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436; see also\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court considered these factors before concluding\nthat no conditions of release could reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.\nAnd the first and fourth factors remain unchanged. As already noted, the Defendant is charged\nwith offenses involving minor victims, and it is undisputed that the nature and circumstances of\nthe offenses charged in the Superseding Indictment weighs in favor of continued detention. On\nthe other hand, the Government has not advanced any evidence that the Defendant poses a\ndanger to any person or to the community, a factor that weighs against detention. The\nDefendant’s arguments therefore focus on the second and third factors.\n\nAs explained belou, neither the arguments put forth in the Defendant’s renewed motion\nfor bail nor the evidence she submited in conjunction with her motion rebut the Court’s\nconclusions, and the Court continues to find, after again applying these factors, that no\nconditions of release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance at future proceedings.\n\nl. The Weight of the Evidence\n\nThe Court will address the strength of the Government’s case first. The Defendant\nargues that the Government lacks any meaningful documentary corroboration of the witness\ntestimony and that the discovery produced to date has included only a “small number of\ndocuments from the time period of the conspiracy.” Def. Mot. at 5. And she claims, as a result,\nthat the Government overstated the strength of its case in advance of the July l4, 2o2o bail\nhearing. See id. at3o 33.

Blaming herself, Virginia began to get into\ntrouble Aged ll, she was sent to live with an aunt but repeatedly ran away.\nLiving cn the streets, she was beaten up and slept with at least two older men in return for food. ‘Twas a\npaedophile’s dream, she says.\nThree years jater, she was reunited with her family and started a new life with her father who had moved\nto Palm Beach,\nFlorida, where he was maintenance manager at Donald Trump’s country club, Mar-a-Lago.\n|\nVirginia got a part-time job as a changing room assistant -which is where, soon after her l5th birthday, |\nshe met Ghislaine Maxwell, who invited her to work as Epstein’s personal masseuse.\n‘l was wearing my uniform — a white miniskirt and a skin-tight white polo top - when I was approached by |\nGhislaine,’ Virginia says.\nl\n‘| told her | wanted to become a masseuse and she said she worked for a very wealthy gentleman who i\nwas looking for a travelling masseuse.\nI'd get training and be paid well.'Virginia’s father gave his blessing, believing his daughter was being\nhanded the opportunity to learn a skill and to work for a wealthy and respectable employer. .\nHe drove her to Epstein’s pink mansion on the Palm Beach waterfront — he also ouns a nine-storey home\nin New York, the city’s biggest private residence; a 7,5oo-acre ranch called ‘Zorro’ in New Mexico and :\nLitle Saint James, a private 7o- acre atoll in the US Virgin Islands.\na ; o3956-l277\nhtp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-l36lo39/Prince-Andrew-girl-l7-sex-offender-frie... 3/l6/Zoll\n DOG=OGR-ooo29o55"};
