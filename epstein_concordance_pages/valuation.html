Ms. Maxwell, who was siting in a jail cell at the time,\nwas asked by Pretrial Services to estimate her assets. Accordingly, she gave her best\nestimate of the assets she held in her oun name, which the government concedes she did\nwith remarkable accuracy considering that she had not reviewed her financial statements.”\n\nThe government’s arguments further confirm that it has lost all objectivity and will\nview at any fact involving Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible light. For example, the\ngovernment asserts that Ms. Maxwell has demonstrated “sophistication in hiding her assets”\nand characterizes her transfers to a trust as “funneling” assets to her spouse to “hide her true\nwealth.” (/d. at 24). There is nothing unusual, let alone nefarious or even particularly\nsophisticated about transferring assets into a trust or a spouse. Indeed, Ms. Maxwell fully\ndisclosed these transactions on her joint tax returns. More importantly, all of the assets\ndisclosed in the financial report, whether they are ouned by Ms. Maxwell or her spouse, are\nincluded in the bond amount and are subject to forfeiture if she flees.\n\nThe government further argues that the financial condition report shous that Ms.\nMaxwell has access to millions of dollars of “unrestrained funds” that she could use to flee\nthe country and reimburse any of her sureties for the loss of their security. (/d. at 23). That\ncharacterization ls simply untrue. First, as disclosed in the financial report, Ms. Maxwell\nhas procured significant loans on the basis of a negative pledge over her London property.\nSecond, the $4 million controlled by her spouse Pe\ncould only be liquidated with considerable difficulty.\n\nThe government also faults Ms. Maxwell for not including a <span class=\"highlight\">valuation</span> of future\ncontingent assets and income that may never materialize. (/d. at 23-24). For example, ||\n° Moreover, for the reasons discussed in our initial memorandum, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything\nabout her spouse and clearly expressed her reluctance to Pretrial Services early on in the interview.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oll3\n"};
