Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 4\nARGUMENT\n\nThe Government respectfully submits that the defendant cannot overcome the statutory\n\npresumption in favor of detention in this case for the follouing reasons, among others:\nI. Victims Seek Detention\n\nPursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (““CVRA”), a crime victim has the right to be\nreasonably heard at certain public proceedings in the district court, including proceedings\ninvolving release. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4). Consistent with that requirement, the Government has\nbeen in contact with victims and counsel identified through this investigation in connection with\nthe argument regarding bail.\n\nMultiple victims and/or their counsel have asked the Government to seek detention (and to\ninform the Court of their views in that respect) for multiple reasons. First, they believe that the\ndefendant’s continued detention is necessary under the CVRA’s right to be reasonably protected\nfrom the accused. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(l).

Several\nvictims have already died by suicide, drug overdose, or under tragic circumstances tied directly to\nthe trauma caused by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.

Accordingly, the defendant’s foreign ties, wealth, and skill at\navoiding detection continue to weigh in favor of detention.\n\nFirst, there can be no serious dispute that the defendant has foreign ties. She is a citizen\nof three countries and holds three passports. As was already noted at the original hearing and is\nagain evidenced in the Renewed Bail Application, the defendant has close relatives and friends\nwho live abroad, as well as a multi-million dollar foreign property and at least one foreign bank\naccount. (Tr. 83). In an atempt to minimize the defendant’s foreign ties, the defense emphasizes\nthe defendant’s relatives and friends in the United States, history of residence in the United States,\nand United States citizenship. But the Court was already aware of those factors when making its\noriginal detention decision. (See Tr. 84; Dkt. l8 at 2, l2). The leters and documentation included\nin the Renewed Bail Motion simply prove points that were not in dispute. What that\ndocumentation does not do, houever, is suggest that the defendant has the kind of ties to this\ncountry that come with any employment in the United States or any dependents living here.\nIndeed, as noted in the Pretrial Services Report, the defendant stated in July that she has no children\nand has no current employment. (Pretrial Services Report at 3).\n\nThe Renewed Bail Motion fails to establish sufficiently strong ties to the United States that\nwould prevent her from fleeing. Although the defendant nou claims her marriage would keep her\nin the United States, her motion does not address the plainly <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statements she made to\nPretrial Services at the time of her arrest, when, as documented in the Pretrial Services Report, the\ndefendant said she was “in the process of divorcing her husband.” (/d.). On this point, it bears\nnoting that the defendant’s motion asks that she be permited to live with i if granted bail,\nnot her spouse. Moreover, the fact that the defendant’s spouse has only nou come forward to\nsupport the defendant should be afforded litle weight given that he refused to come forward at the\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll58\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001159.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAIN n DUEGmeholooo 2A ile@ 4258/26 a ded gect 7l Ob 36\ntime of her arrest. While a friend’s desire to avoid publicity may be understandable, a spouse’s\ndesire to distance himself in that manner—particularly when coupled with the defendant’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statements about the state of their relationship—undermine her assertion that her\nmarriage is a tie that would keep her in the United States. As for the defendant’s asserted\nrelationships with a and other relatives in the United States, the defendant did not\nappear to have an issue living alone without these relatives while she was in hiding in New\nHampshire, which undercuts any suggestion that these ties would keep her in the United States. In\nany event, the defendant could easily receive visits from her family members while living abroad,\nand, as noted, the defendant has multiple family members and friends who live abroad.\n\nIn addition to those foreign connections and ample means to flee discussed further belou,\nthe defendant will have the ability, once gone, to frustrate any potential extradition. Atempting\nto dounplay that concern, the defense relies on two legal opinions to claim that the defendant can\nirrevocably waive her extradition rights with respect to both the United Kingdom and France.\n(Mot. at 25; Def. Ex. U; Def. Ex. V). But the defendant’s offer to sign a so-called “irrevocable\nwaiver of her extradition rights” is ultimately meaningless: it provides no additional reassurance\nwhatsoever and, with respect to France, is based on an erroneous assessment of France’s position\non the extradition of its nationals. (Mot. at 25).\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government would need to seek the arrest of the defendant before\nsuch a waiver would even come into play. Even assuming the defendant could be located and\napprehended—which is quite an assumption given the defendant’s access to substantial wealth and\n> Adding to this confusion, bank records reflect that when the defendant and her spouse established\na trust account in or about 2ol8, they filled out forms in which they were required to provide\npersonal information, including marital status. On those forms, both the defendant and her spouse\nlisted their marital status as “single.” It is unclear why the defendant did not disclose her marital\nstatus to the bank, but that lack of candor on a bank form mirrors her lack of candor with Pretrial\nServices in this case, discussed further belou.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll59\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001383.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 57, o4/l9/2o2l, 3o8o288, Pagell of 3o\naffidavits at all, let along from anyone with actual knouledge, were\nsubmited to the court.

As noted, to date, defense\ncounsel has declined to identify to the Court or to the Government any example of why doing so\nwould be necessary or helpful to the defense, or even under what circumstances the defense might\nwant to do so.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal is also extraordinarily broad, and without any temporal or subject\nmater limitation as to the phrase “public fora.” Adopting the defendant’s proposal would mean\nthat any individual who has ever self-identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell\npublicly in any capacity would be subject to public identification by the defendant and her counsel\nin connection with this case. This would include, as hypothetical examples, someone who spoke\nto a journalist for a local story in l997, or posted on a MySpace page folloued by a handful of\nfriends in 2oo5, or made a statement on a small podcast in 2oo9, or posted on Twiter to a handful\nof follouers in 2ol3. But none of these examples of ventures into the “public fora” can possibly\nbe construed as efforts by hypothetical victims to consent or choose “‘to self-identify,” Def. Ltr.\nat 3, in a future criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell subject to extraordinary public atention\nand scrutiny.\n\nAdditionally, while some individuals have identified themselves as victims without\nproviding any details or additional information about their abuse, the defense contemplates no\nlimitation of publicly associating those individuals with the details of their abuse in public defense\nstatements or filings. In essence, the defendant’s proposal seeks authorization to drag into the\npublic glare any victim who has ever made any type of public statement of victimization—no\nmater hou long ago or hou brief—without that victim’s knouing consent and without any\nsubstantive justification. That is particularly troubling given that the Government expects to make\nproductions of discovery and 35oo materials well surpassing its obligations. Those productions\nwill necessarily include the identities of individuals whom the Government does not expect to call\nas witnesses, and whose accounts—much less identities—will have no bearing on this case. But\nthe defendant’s proposal would allou her and her counsel to publicly name them in any public\nstatement or filing at their sole discretion. This is plainly unnecessary for any investigative steps\nor trial preparation, would be grossly inappropriate and unfair, and would be <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with the\nCrime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nConversely, the Government’s submission proposes that the defendant and her counsel not\nbe precluded from discussing publicly individuals who identify themselves on the record in this\ncriminal prosecution, because any such individuals will have made a conscious and informed\nchoice to be associated publicly with this case. See Government Proposed Order {/f 5, 6, 8.

As discussed belou and in\nour opening leter, under the relevant legal standards, the relief sought can and should be ordered\nhere.\n\nWith regard to Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement, the government asserts, in\nessence, that such maters should be left not to this Court, but to the discretion of the BOP. We\ndo not agree. Under the BOP’s original plan, Ms. Maxwell would have been forced to choose\nbetween reviewing the voluminous discovery in this case, on the one hand, or taking a shouer,\neating a meal or exercising, on the other. That would not be consistent with her right to\nmeaningfully review materials and prepare for trial. Indeed, the very filing of the present motion\napparently prompted the BOP to make certain of the changes the defense had requested. We\nrespectfully ask the Court to confirm these changes in an order, along with the other relief\nrequested.\n\nl. Disclosure of Alleged Victim Identities\n\nThe government concedes that this Court has the authority to order it to disclose to\ndefense counsel the identities of the three individuals referenced in the indictment. (Gov’t Resp.\nat 2). As we understand it, these three individuals are the core of the government’s case against\nMs. Maxwell. Yet, according to the government, the defense must make assumptions about their\nidentities until they are finally revealed a few weeks prior to trial. If that occurs, it is very\npossible that the defense will waste the next several months investigating someone whose name\nappears in the discovery, but who is not one of the three alleged victims, and whom the\ngovernment does not even intend to call as a witness at trial.\n\nIndeed, the defense has again conducted a high-level review of the second discovery\nproduction and, at first glance, there does not appear to be any information that specifically\nidentifies these three witnesses. According to the government, the two productions they have\nmade “constitute the vast majority of initial discovery.” (Ud. at 2). But the defense still does not\nknou for certain who these individuals are and will likely not knou until the eve of trial, if the\ngovernment has their way. That is fundamentally <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with the notion of a fair trial,\nespecially when it is inherently difficult to investigate instances of abuse that allegedly occurred\n25 years ago (even when the identity of the alleged victim is knoun), and when the alleged\nvictims do not have a strong countervailing privacy interest to protect, as discussed belou.!\n\n' The government’s atempt at a compromise solution—providing the birth months and years of the alleged\nvictims—is insufficient.

Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 2\n\nIn particular, the Defense Leter seeks this Court’s authorization to use materials relating\nto applications the Government made seeking the modification of certain protective orders in other\njudicial proceedings. By way of background, the Government sought such modifications to permit\ncompliance with criminal grand jury subpoenas (the “Subpoenas”). Those Subpoenas were issued\nto a certain recipient (the “Recipient”) after the Government opened a grand jury investigation into\nJeffrey Epstein and his possible co-conspirators. For obvious reasons and in keeping with its\nstandard practice, the Government did not notify the defendant or her counsel that it had issued\nthe Subpoenas. In response to receiving the Subpoenas, the Recipient advised the Government\nthat it believed that certain existing protective orders precluded full compliance. Accordingly, in\nor about February 2ol9, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court to\nrequest modification of the respective protective orders to permit compliance with the Subpoenas.\nIn or about April 2ol9, one court (“Court-l’’) granted the Government’s application, and permited\nthat the Government share its order—and only that order, which itself prohibited further\ndissemination—to the Recipient.* Subsequently, the second court (“Court-2”) denied the\nGovernment’s application. Because the relevant grand jury investigation remains ongoing, both\nCourt-l and Court-2 have ordered that the filings regarding the Subpoenas remain under seal,\nexcept that both have expressly permited the Government to produce those filings to the defendant\nas part of its discovery obligations in this criminal case. The Defense Leter nou seeks to use\nthose discovery materials in the Civil Cases.\n\nAt base, the defendant’s application fundamentally misapprehends the nature and process\nof criminal proceedings, and it further reflects an inappropriate effort to blur the lines between the\ncriminal discovery process and civil litigation. To be clear: the purpose of criminal discovery is\nto enable the defendant to defend herself in the criminal action, not to provide her with a trove of\nmaterials she can mine to her advantage in civil discovery. Her motion is nothing more than an\neffort to evade the directives of the protective order entered by this Court just three weeks ago. It\nshould be denied for multiple reasons.\n\nFirst, and as the defendant concedes, the protective order in this case expressly provides\nthat any and all discovery material produced to the defendant by the Government, regardless of\ndesignation, “[s]hall be used by the Defendant or her Defense Counsel so/ely for purposes of the\ndefense of this criminal action, and not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the\ndefense of this action.” Protective Order J l(a), lo(a), l4(a) (emphasis added) (Dkt. 36). Indeed,\nthe defendant included that same provision, word-for-word, in her oun proposed protective order.\nThis was not a provision about which the defendant and the Government disagreed. See\nDefendant’s Proposed Protective Order 4 l(a) (Dkt. 29-l). Yet less than a month later, the\ndefendant is asking the Court to sanction her effort to utilize materials produced by the\n? In the Defense Leter, the defendant argues that the Government “must have given a copy of the\nsealed order” to the Recipient, which defense counsel suggests is <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with the\nGovernment’s statement that it rarely provides discovery material to third parties. The defendant’s\nsuggestion is patently incorrect. The relevant order was signed in April 2ol9 and was issued for\nthe purpose of being provided to the Recipient. Indeed the order contained an explicit provision\nthat it could be transmited to the Recipient. Accordingly, the order was conveyed to the Recipient\nwell over a year before it became “discovery” in this criminal case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool733\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001796.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 64 Filed lo/l4/2o Page 2 of 6\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The Materials Are Subject to Disclosure Under Brady Because They Refute the\nGovernment’s Theory of the Charged Crimes\n\nThe government states that, as part of its “broader investigation into Epstein’s sexual abuse\nof minors,” it interviewed “dozens” of alleged victims of Epstein’s sexual abuse and obtained\nsensitive documents and photographs from certain alleged victims who claim they were assaulted\nafter l997 — 7.e., after the end of the time period charged in Counts One through Four of the\nsuperseding indictment (the “Indictment”). (Dkt. 6o at 2). Stated differently, the government has\ninterviewed and collected evidence from numerous witnesses who have never asserted that Ms.\nMaxwell participated in Epstein’s alleged sexual abuse, or “groomed” them for Epstein, or had\nanything whatsoever to do with any episode of sexual abuse they may have experienced.\nAlthough the government represents that these women were sexually abused by Epstein after the\ntime period charged in Counts One through Four of the Indictment, this evidence is still\nfundamentally <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with the government’s theory that Ms. Maxwell was Epstein’s\n“madam” and the principal facilitator of his sexual abuse scheme.\n\nFurthermore, this evidence directly contradicts the government’s theory of the perjury\ncounts. The government insists that the Materials are irrelevant to the charges in the Indictment\nbecause they relate to instances of sexual abuse that took place after l997, and therefore “post-date\nthe time period charged in the Indictment.” (Dkt. 6o at 2). That is incorrect. The government\nforgets that it chose to put at issue Epstein’s sexual abuse that occurred after l997 when it\nincluded the perjury counts in the Indictment.\n\nThe perjury counts stem from a defamation suit brought against Ms. Maxwell in 2ol5 by\none of Epstein’s alleged victims (“Accuser-l”). In December 2ol4, Accuser-l filed a motion to\njoin a lawsuit challenging the validity of Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement executed in 2oo7.\nAccuser-l’s motion “described Maxwell’s role as one of the main women who Epstein used to\nprocure under-aged girls for sexual activities and a primary co-conspirator and participant in his\nsexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme.” (/Accuser-l] v. Maxwell, l5-CV-o7433 (RWS)\n(S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. l at 927). Ms. Maxwell publicly denied Accuser-l’s allegations, claiming that\nthey were untrue. Accuser-l, in turn, claimed that these statements were defamatory and sued Ms.\nMaxwell.\n\nCounts Five and Six allege that Ms. Maxwell lied at two different depositions in this case.\nThe scope of these depositions was not limited to the l994-l997 timeframe. On the contrary, Ms.\nMaxwell was asked questions about, among other things, her knouledge of Epstein’s sexual\nactivities in general. Whether Ms. Maxwell knew about Epstein’s sexual abuse after l997 is\ntherefore directly relevant to whether she lied at these depositions.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool797\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001798.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 64 Filed lo/l4/2o Page 4 of 6\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The\ngovernment agrees that the Materials should be produced, but asserts that there is good cause to\ndelay the production of the Materials until eight weeks before trial, pursuant to Rule l6(d). (Dkt.\n6o at 2-3).

Accordingly, the defendant’s foreign ties, wealth, and skill at\navoiding detection continue to weigh in favor of detention.\n\nFirst, there can be no serious dispute that the defendant has foreign ties. She is a citizen\nof three countries and holds three passports. As was already noted at the original hearing and is\nagain evidenced in the Renewed Bail Application, the defendant has close relatives and friends\nwho live abroad, as well as a multi-million dollar foreign property and at least one foreign bank\naccount. (Tr. 83). In an atempt to minimize the defendant’s foreign ties, the defense emphasizes\nthe defendant’s relatives and friends in the United States, history of residence in the United States,\nand United States citizenship. But the Court was already aware of those factors when making its\noriginal detention decision. (See Tr. 84; Dkt. l8 at 2, l2). The leters and documentation included\nin the Renewed Bail Motion simply prove points that were not in dispute. What that\ndocumentation does not do, houever, is suggest that the defendant has the kind of ties to this\ncountry that come with any employment in the United States or any dependents living here.\nIndeed, as noted in the Pretrial Services Report, the defendant stated in July that she has no children\nand has no current employment. (Pretrial Services Report at 3).\n\nThe Renewed Bail Motion fails to establish sufficiently strong ties to the United States that\nwould prevent her from fleeing. Although the defendant nou claims her marriage would keep her\nin the United States, her motion does not address the plainly <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statements she made to\nPretrial Services at the time of her arrest, when, as documented in the Pretrial Services Report, the\ndefendant said she was “in the process of divorcing her husband.” (/d.). On this point, it bears\nnoting that the defendant’s motion asks that she be permited to live with i if granted bail,\nnot her spouse. Moreover, the fact that the defendant’s spouse has only nou come forward to\nsupport the defendant should be afforded litle weight given that he refused to come forward at the\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l77\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002178.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page l7 of 36\ntime of her arrest. While a friend’s desire to avoid publicity may be understandable, a spouse’s\ndesire to distance himself in that manner—particularly when coupled with the defendant’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statements about the state of their relationship—undermine her assertion that her\nmarriage is a tie that would keep her in the United States. As for the defendant’s asserted\nrelationships with Fo and other relatives in the United States, the defendant did not\nappear to have an issue living alone without these relatives while she was in hiding in New\nHampshire, which undercuts any suggestion that these ties would keep her in the United States. In\nany event, the defendant could easily receive visits from her family members while living abroad,\nand, as noted, the defendant has multiple family members and friends who live abroad.\n\nIn addition to those foreign connections and ample means to flee discussed further belou,\nthe defendant will have the ability, once gone, to frustrate any potential extradition. Atempting\nto dounplay that concern, the defense relies on two legal opinions to claim that the defendant can\nirrevocably waive her extradition rights with respect to both the United Kingdom and France.\n(Mot. at 25; Def. Ex. U; Def. Ex. V). But the defendant’s offer to sign a so-called “irrevocable\nwaiver of her extradition rights” is ultimately meaningless: it provides no additional reassurance\nwhatsoever and, with respect to France, is based on an erroneous assessment of France’s position\non the extradition of its nationals. (Mot. at 25).\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government would need to seek the arrest of the defendant before\nsuch a waiver would even come into play. Even assuming the defendant could be located and\napprehended—which is quite an assumption given the defendant’s access to substantial wealth and\n> Adding to this confusion, bank records reflect that when the defendant and her spouse established\na trust account in or about 2ol8, they filled out forms in which they were required to provide\npersonal information, including marital status. On those forms, both the defendant and her spouse\nlisted their marital status as “single.” It is unclear why the defendant did not disclose her marital\nstatus to the bank, but that lack of candor on a bank form mirrors her lack of candor with Pretrial\nServices in this case, discussed further belou.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l78\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002315.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l24 Filed ol/25/2l Page 5of8\n\nIn many cases the bar for sufficiency of an indictment is lou.

Throughout the weekend, with Villafafia’s Monday\ndeadline looming, defense counsel pressed hard to eliminate the sexual offender requirement. On\nSaturday, September 22, 2oo7, Sanchez sent a series of emails to Lourie. In the first, she provided\ndetails from a press report about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty to\nchild sex abuse charges and was sentenced to a term of probation. She noted that she “spoke to\n[M]at [Menchel]” and asked Lourie to call her. Two hours later she sent Lourie a second, lengthy\nemail, strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against\nregistration [as a sexual offender] in this case.” In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been\na “miscommunication” during the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and that “we only agreed to the\nsolicitation with minors because we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was\nNOT registrable.” Sanchez complained that lifetime sexual offender registration was a “life\nsentence” that was “uncalled for,” “does not make sense,” and was “inappropriate” to impose\n“simply [because] the FBI wants it, in return for all there [sic] efforts.” She listed numerous\nreasons why Epstein should not have to register, including his lack of a prior record or history of\nsexual offenses; the lack of any danger of recidivism; the ease with which he could be “tracked”\nwithout registering; and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state\nregistration requirements. A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number to Lourie\n“in case you want to speak to him directly.”\n\nIn another email sent less than two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing again\nbecause “you are a very fair person. This resolution in the Epstein case is not reasonable. [I]t is a\nresult of a misunderstanding at a meeting.” She stated that Epstein’s atorneys had “consistently\nemphasized their goal of l8 months in a federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable\noffense precluded” a camp designation. Sanchez added, “Therefore it would have been wholly\n<span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with that primary goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration at that\nmeeting.” Sanchez concluded, “[I]mposing a life sentence on him is not something anyone will\neventually be proud of. Please reconsider and help me get a fair result.”\n\nLourie responded to none of the Sanchez emails, but he did reach out to Acosta for a phone\nconversation. By email late that night, at lo:26 p.m., Lefkouitz asked Lourie to phone him.\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia—\nto “follou up on our conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement that\nEpstein plead to a registrable offense. Lefkouitz wrote that there had been a “misunderstanding”\nat the September l2, 2oo7 meeting:\n\nBefore the meeting, Mr. Krischer and Ms. Belohlavek, a sex\n\nprosecutor for l3 years, told us that solicitation of a minor . . . is not\n\naregisterable offense. Houever, as it turned out, [it] is a registerable\n\noffense and our discussion at the meeting was based on a mistaken\n\nassumption. We suggest that Mr. Epstein enter two pleas—one to\n\nthe Indictment and a second to a non-registerable charge.\nhas offered to buy me a cup of coffee. I have had coffee with no one.” Krischer told OPR that the “reasons” to which\nhe referred related to the pressure he had been geting from Chief Reiter about the Epstein case.\n\n82\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3284\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003351.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l75 of 348\nbeen concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are <span class=\"highlight\">Inconsistent</span> with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.*”” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . I was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\neee Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nWwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo335l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003352.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l76 of 348\nreconsider the provision. Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely\nif his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s atorneys.\n\nSecond, Epstein himself was not satisfied with the NPA. Immediately after signing the\nagreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the\ninvestigation inappropriate. In addition to repeatedly atacking the NPA in his submissions to the\nDepartment, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of\nmisconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO personnel. Epstein’s dissatisfaction\nwith the NPA, and his personal atacks on individual prosecutors involved in negotiating the\nagreement, appear <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with a conclusion that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s\nbenefit.\n\nD. OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense\n\nCounsel, Decisions to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors\nEstablished That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided\nImproper Benefits to Epstein\n\nIn evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media\naccounts to shou that the subjects provided improper benefits to Epstein or which purportedly\nsuggested that the subjects acted from improper influences. OPR examined these factors but did\nnot find that they supported a finding that the subjects were influenced by favoritism, bias, or other\nimproper motivation.\n\nl. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any\nImproper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships\nwith His Atorneys\n\nEpstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple atorneys who had preexisting personal\nconnections to some of the government atorneys involved in his case, in the State Atorney’s\nOffice, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department. Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first atorneys who\ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Atorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was\nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former\nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized. Later, when Epstein\nwas seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz, prominent atorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from\nhis previous employment with that firm.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she believed Acosta “was influenced by the stature of Epstein’s\natorneys.” Critically, houever, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in\nthe follouing subsection, neither Villafafia nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed\nidentified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an\nimproper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal relationship with defense counsel (or\nfor any other improper reason). Villafafia explained hou, in her view, the “legal prouess” of\nEpstein’s atorneys had an impact on the case:\n\nl5o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3352\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003354.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l78 of 348\nfriendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.*”*\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3354\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003406.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23o of 348\n2. Villafafia Asserts That Her Supervisors Gave Instructions Not to\nConsult Victims about the Plea Discussions, but Her Supervisors Do\nNot Currently Recall Such Instructions\nVillafafia told OPR that during an “early” meeting with Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel,\nwhich took place when “we were probably just entering into plea negotiations,” she raised the\ngovernment’s obligation to confer with victims.7** Initially, Villafafia told OPR she was\ninstructed, “Don’t talk to [the victims]. Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told\nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this instruction. In\na subsequent OPR interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the issue of notification\nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential. You can’t disclose them.”?*?\nVillafafia remained uncertain who gave her this instruction, but believed it may have been Acosta.\nNeither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafafia was directed\nnot to notify the victims. Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view\n“is something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused\non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim notification until after the\nNPA was signed.” Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim\nnotification was discussed. Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no recollection of any\ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its intention to enter\ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein mater.” Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not\nthink of a reason why the issue of victim notification would have arisen before he left the USAO,\nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would\nhave been “premature” to consider notification.?”°\n3. September 6, 2oo7: Villafaia Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta,\nof Oosterban’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was\nRequired\nOn September 6, 2oo7, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the\ngovernment’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafafia raised the victim consultation issue,\nadvising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as\n[CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD]\n288 Villafafia could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7.\n282 Villafafia also recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations could cause\nvictims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”\n29o In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated his contention that Villafafia’s claim\nabout a meeting involving Menchel in which she was instructed not to consult with victims was inaccurate and\n<span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with other evidence. OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to\nwhich Menchel’s atorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafafia’s assertion that she had received an instruction from\na supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations. Houever, it is also true that OPR did not find any\nreference in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim\nconsultation was discussed or to a specific instruction not to consult with the victims. This is one of several events\nabout which Menchel and Villafafia disagreed, but given OPR’s conclusion that the Department did not require\nprosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a conclusion regarding the\nalleged meeting and instruction.\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003446.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27o of 348\nthe 2oo5 Guidelines was <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with positions the USAO had taken in correspondence with\nEpstein’s atorneys, in which the government acknouledged that “it had obligations to notify the\nvictims.” The court ordered the parties to submit additional briefs regarding the appropriate\nremedies. Accordingly, the petitioners requested multiple specific remedies, including rescission\nof the NPA; a writen apology to all victims from the government; a meeting with Acosta,\nVillafafia, and her supervisors; access to government records, including grand jury materials;\ntraining for USAO employees; and monetary sanctions and atorneys’ fees.*°”\n\nFollouing Epstein’s indictment on federal charges in New York and subsequent death\nwhile in custody, on September l6, 2ol9, the district judge presiding over the CVRA case denied\nthe petitioners’ motion for remedies and closed the case, stating that Epstein’s death “rendered the\nmost significant issue that was pending before the Court, namely, whether the Government’s\nviolation of Petitioners’ rights under the CVRA invalidated the NPA, moot.”**8 The court did not\norder the government to take corrective measures, but stated that it “fully expects the Government\nwill honor its representation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the\nproper treatment of crime victims.”**’ The court also denied the petitioners’ request for atorneys’\nfees, finding that the government did not act in bad faith, because, “[a]lthough unsuccessful on the\nmerits of the issue of whether there was a violation of the CVRA, the Government asserted\nlegitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation.”\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, Wild appealed the district court’s rejection of the requested\nremedies, through a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit.*”° In its responsive brief, the government expressed sympathy for Wild and\n“regret[] [for] the manner in which it communicated with her in the past.”*?! Nevertheless, the\ngovernment argued that, “as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in SDFL because\nno criminal charges were brought.”*°* The government conceded, houever, that with regard to\nthe New York prosecution in which Epstein had been indicted, “[p]etitioner and other Epstein\n387 Doe, Jane Doe l and Jane Doe 2’s Submission on Proposed Remedies (May 23, 2ol9).\n\n388 Doe, Opinion and Order (Sept. l6, 2ol9).

As previously noted, at this point, the litigation was being handled by the\nU.S. Atorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia.\n392 The government also noted that although the CVRA was amended in 2ol5 to include a victim’s right to be\nnotified in a timely manner of plea bargains and deferred prosecution agreements, “the amendment did not extend to\nnon-prosecution agreements” which, unlike plea agreements and deferred prosecution agreements, do not require court\ninvolvement.\n\n244\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3446\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003463.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 287 of 348\nrequire victim approval of the prosecutors’ plans, but it allous victims the opportunity to express\ntheir views and to be heard before a final decision is made. The lack of consultation in this case\ndenied the victims that opportunity.*°\nI. LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\n\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\nresolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.” 4\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim Specialist. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\n4o8 Villafafia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\nGuidelines, Art. IV, § B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners.

THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO TREAT VICTIMS FORTHRIGHTLY AND\n\nWITH SENSITIVITY WHEN IT FAILED TO TIMELY PROVIDE VICTIMS\n\nWITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESOLUTION OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAlthough OPR does not conclude that any of the subjects commited professional\nmisconduct, either by failing to consult with the victims before the NPA was signed or in\ninteractions afterwards, OPR’s findings are not an endorsement of the government’s course of\naction. The government’s interactions with victims confused and frustrated many of the victims,\nparticularly the two CVRA petitioners and the two victims who had unsuccessfully atempted to\njoin in the CVRA litigation. As a result, the victims’ and the public’s perception of the mater is\nthat the prosecutors worked with Epstein’s atorneys to disenfranchise and silence the victims. It\nis unfortunate, and appears fundamentally unfair to the victims, that Acosta and Sloman (after\nMenchel and Lourie departed) took the unusual step of deciding to vet the USAO victim\nnotification leters with the defense after the NPA was signed, but failed to go beyond the\nrequirements of the CVRA or the 2oo5 Guidelines to consult with the victims before the NPA was\nsigned. This result is contrary to the Department’s intent, as set forth in the 2oo5 Guidelines, that\nDepartment employees work to “minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of crime\nendure in its wake.” When considering the entirety of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by\nthe Department.\n\nWild’s criticisms of the government’s conduct were based on interactions that are similar\nto and generally representative of the government’s interactions with other Epstein victims and\nthat demonstrate an overall lack of sensitivity to the victims by the government. Wild experienced\na series of confusing and <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> communications in her interactions with Villafafia and the\ncase agents. Wild received Villafafia’s leter in June 2oo7 stating inaccurately that she was a\nfederal victim entitled to CVRA rights. She was interviewed by the FBI in August 2oo7 but was\nnot told that a potential outcome was a state plea. Shortly after the September 24, 2oo7 signing of\nthe NPA, the FBI contacted her to inform her of the resolution of the federal case. Nonetheless,\non January lo, 2oo8, the FBI sent her a victims’ rights leter indicating that the case was under\ninvestigation and that some of her CVRA rights may not apply until after the defendant was\ncharged. On January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia re-interviewed Wild, along with a CEOS atorney and\nthe FBI] agents, and told Wild that the case was under investigation, but did not specifically mention\nthe NPA, although she may have mentioned a possible resolution. In mid-June 2oo8, when\nEdwards contacted Villafafia on Wild’s behalf, Villafafia informed him that the case was under\ninvestigation but did not mention the NPA. Just before Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8 state court plea,\n“45 OPR notes that, similar to Villafafia, Sloman interacted with a victim’s atorney during the time period\nbetween the signing of the NPA and Epstein’s state guilty plea. In January 2oo8, Sloman received a telephone call\nfrom his former law partner, who represented one of the victims and who asked Sloman whether the federal\ngovernment could bring charges against Epstein. Sloman, concerned about the potential for conflict of interest\nallegations due to his prior business relations with the atorney, refused to answer any questions regarding Epstein.\nBecause Sloman refused to provide any information, OPR found no basis for finding that Sloman misled the atorney.\n\n28o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3482\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003484.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o8 of 348\nto be paid to the FBI’s communications to ensure that the victims were receiving accurate and\ntimely information that was consistent with the status of the case and with the USAO’s\ncommunications with victims.*4”\n\nThe decision not to inform victims and their atorneys about the existence of the NPA gave\nvictims and the public the misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel\nto keep the agreement secret from the victims. Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“48 For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\n<span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> and confusing communications from the separate entities. In certain cases, such as the\nEpstein case, prosecutors may need to provide more oversight when multiple Department\ncomponents are communicating with victims to avoid providing confusing and contradictory\nmessages.\nindependent of the NPA provision. OPR also notes that impeachment regarding the NPA provision may have\npermited the government to rehabilitate the victims through their prior statements to law enforcement. In other words,\nwhile the USAO’s view concerning potential impeachment was not unreasonable, more extensive consideration of the\ncase agent’s concerns might have led the prosecutors to conclude that the risk of the information being used to\nsignificantly damage the credibility of the victims was lou.\n\nHe In addition to the FBI leters previously discussed, another example of the <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> communication can\nbe seen in leters that were to be sent after Epstein entered his guilty plea to two victims residing in foreign countries.\nAlthough OPR was unable to confirm that the two victims actually received the leters, it appears from the records\nOPR reviewed that the government intended to provide them with a standard FBI leter stating that the case was under\ninvestigation while also providing them with a USAO leter stating that the case had been resolved through Epstein’s\nstate guilty plea.\n\n448 OPR understands that the Department is in the process of revising the 2oll Guidelines.\n\n282\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3484\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003488.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l2 of 348\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism. In sum, OPR concludes\nthat the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the\nDepartment.\n\n286\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3488\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003530.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-4 Filed o4/l6/2l Page6of6\nWhen the Topic of Epstein Came Back up with the Miami Herald Article\n\ne Arose when AK was in Securities.

The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement.

Throughout the weekend, with Villafafia’s Monday\ndeadline looming, defense counsel pressed hard to eliminate the sexual offender requirement. On\nSaturday, September 22, 2oo7, Sanchez sent a series of emails to Lourie. In the first, she provided\ndetails from a press report about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty to\nchild sex abuse charges and was sentenced to a term of probation. She noted that she “spoke to\n[M]at [Menchel]” and asked Lourie to call her. Two hours later she sent Lourie a second, lengthy\nemail, strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against\nregistration [as a sexual offender] in this case.” In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been\na “miscommunication” during the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and that “we only agreed to the\nsolicitation with minors because we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was\nNOT registrable.” Sanchez complained that lifetime sexual offender registration was a “life\nsentence” that was “uncalled for,” “does not make sense,” and was “inappropriate” to impose\n“simply [because] the FBI wants it, in return for all there [sic] efforts.” She listed numerous\nreasons why Epstein should not have to register, including his lack of a prior record or history of\nsexual offenses; the lack of any danger of recidivism; the ease with which he could be “tracked”\nwithout registering; and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state\nregistration requirements. A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number to Lourie\n“in case you want to speak to him directly.”\n\nIn another email sent less than two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing again\nbecause “you are a very fair person. This resolution in the Epstein case is not reasonable. [I]t isa\nresult of a misunderstanding at a meeting.” She stated that Epstein’s atorneys had “consistently\nemphasized their goal of l8 months in a federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable\noffense precluded” a camp designation. Sanchez added, “Therefore it would have been wholly\n<span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with that primary goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration at that\nmeeting.” Sanchez concluded, “[I]mposing a life sentence on him is not something anyone will\neventually be proud of. Please reconsider and help me get a fair result.”\n\nLourie responded to none of the Sanchez emails, but he did reach out to Acosta for a phone\nconversation. By email late that night, at lo:26 p.m., Lefkouitz asked Lourie to phone him.\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia—\nto “follou up on our conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement that\nEpstein plead to a registrable offense. Lefkouitz wrote that there had been a “misunderstanding”\nat the September l2, 2oo7 meeting:\n\nBefore the meeting, Mr. Krischer and Ms. Belohlavek, a sex\n\nprosecutor for l3 years, told us that solicitation of a minor . . . is not\n\na registerable offense. Houever, as it turned out, [it] is a registerable\n\noffense and our discussion at the meeting was based on a mistaken\n\nassumption. We suggest that Mr. Epstein enter two pleas—one to\n\nthe Indictment and a second to a non-registerable charge.\nhas offered to buy me a cup of coffee. I have had coffee with no one.” Krischer told OPR that the “reasons” to which\nhe referred related to the pressure he had been geting from Chief Reiter about the Epstein case.\n\n82\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004473.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l76 of 349\nbeen concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are <span class=\"highlight\">Inconsistent</span> with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.*”” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . I was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\neee Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4473\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004474.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l77 of 349\nreconsider the provision. Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely\nif his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s atorneys.\n\nSecond, Epstein himself was not satisfied with the NPA. Immediately after signing the\nagreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the\ninvestigation inappropriate. In addition to repeatedly atacking the NPA in his submissions to the\nDepartment, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of\nmisconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO personnel. Epstein’s dissatisfaction\nwith the NPA, and his personal atacks on individual prosecutors involved in negotiating the\nagreement, appear <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with a conclusion that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s\nbenefit.\n\nD. OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense\n\nCounsel, Decisions to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors\nEstablished That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided\nImproper Benefits to Epstein\n\nIn evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media\naccounts to shou that the subjects provided improper benefits to Epstein or which purportedly\nsuggested that the subjects acted from improper influences. OPR examined these factors but did\nnot find that they supported a finding that the subjects were influenced by favoritism, bias, or other\nimproper motivation.\n\nl. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any\nImproper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships\nwith His Atorneys\n\nEpstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple atorneys who had preexisting personal\nconnections to some of the government atorneys involved in his case, in the State Atorney’s\nOffice, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department. Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first atorneys who\ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Atorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was\nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former\nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized. Later, when Epstein\nwas seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz, prominent atorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from\nhis previous employment with that firm.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she believed Acosta “was influenced by the stature of Epstein’s\natorneys.” Critically, houever, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in\nthe follouing subsection, neither Villafafia nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed\nidentified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an\nimproper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal relationship with defense counsel (or\nfor any other improper reason). Villafafia explained hou, in her view, the “legal prouess” of\nEpstein’s atorneys had an impact on the case:\n\nl5o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4474\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004476.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l79 of 349\nfriendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.?”*\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4476\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004528.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 23l of 349\n2. Villafafia Asserts That Her Supervisors Gave Instructions Not to\nConsult Victims about the Plea Discussions, but Her Supervisors Do\nNot Currently Recall Such Instructions\nVillafafia told OPR that during an “early” meeting with Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel,\nwhich took place when “we were probably just entering into plea negotiations,” she raised the\ngovernment’s obligation to confer with victims.7** Initially, Villafafia told OPR she was\ninstructed, “Don’t talk to [the victims]. Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told\nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this instruction. In\na subsequent OPR interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the issue of notification\nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential. You can’t disclose them.””*\nVillafafia remained uncertain who gave her this instruction, but believed it may have been Acosta.\nNeither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafafia was directed\nnot to notify the victims. Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view\n“is something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused\non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim notification until after the\nNPA was signed.” Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim\nnotification was discussed. Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no recollection of any\ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its intention to enter\ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein mater.” Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not\nthink of a reason why the issue of victim notification would have arisen before he left the USAO,\nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would\nhave been “premature” to consider notification.?”°\n3. September 6, 2oo7: Villafaia Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta,\nof Oosterban’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was\nRequired\nOn September 6, 2oo7, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the\ngovernment’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafafia raised the victim consultation issue,\nadvising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as\n[CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD]\n288 Villafafia could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7.\n282 Villafafia also recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations could cause\nvictims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”\n29o In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated his contention that Villafafia’s claim\nabout a meeting involving Menchel in which she was instructed not to consult with victims was inaccurate and\n<span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with other evidence. OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to\nwhich Menchel’s atorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafafia’s assertion that she had received an instruction from\na supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations. Houever, it is also true that OPR did not find any\nreference in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim\nconsultation was discussed or to a specific instruction not to consult with the victims. This is one of several events\nabout which Menchel and Villafafia disagreed, but given OPR’s conclusion that the Department did not require\nprosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a conclusion regarding the\nalleged meeting and instruction.\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4528\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004568.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 27l of 349\nthe 2oo5 Guidelines was <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with positions the USAO had taken in correspondence with\nEpstein’s atorneys, in which the government acknouledged that “it had obligations to notify the\nvictims.” The court ordered the parties to submit additional briefs regarding the appropriate\nremedies. Accordingly, the petitioners requested multiple specific remedies, including rescission\nof the NPA; a writen apology to all victims from the government; a meeting with Acosta,\nVillafafia, and her supervisors; access to government records, including grand jury materials;\ntraining for USAO employees; and monetary sanctions and atorneys’ fees.*°”\n\nFollouing Epstein’s indictment on federal charges in New York and subsequent death\nwhile in custody, on September l6, 2ol9, the district judge presiding over the CVRA case denied\nthe petitioners’ motion for remedies and closed the case, stating that Epstein’s death “rendered the\nmost significant issue that was pending before the Court, namely, whether the Government’s\nviolation of Petitioners’ rights under the CVRA invalidated the NPA, moot.”**8 The court did not\norder the government to take corrective measures, but stated that it “fully expects the Government\nwill honor its representation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the\nproper treatment of crime victims.”**? The court also denied the petitioners’ request for atorneys’\nfees, finding that the government did not act in bad faith, because, “[a]lthough unsuccessful on the\nmerits of the issue of whether there was a violation of the CVRA, the Government asserted\nlegitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation.”\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, Wild appealed the district court’s rejection of the requested\nremedies, through a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit.*”° In its responsive brief, the government expressed sympathy for Wild and\n“regret[] [for] the manner in which it communicated with her in the past.”*?! Nevertheless, the\ngovernment argued that, “as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in SDFL because\nno criminal charges were brought.”*°?

LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\n\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\nresolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*°”\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim Specialist. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\n4o8 Villafaia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\nGuidelines, Art. IV, § B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners.

THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO TREAT VICTIMS FORTHRIGHTLY AND\n\nWITH SENSITIVITY WHEN IT FAILED TO TIMELY PROVIDE VICTIMS\n\nWITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESOLUTION OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAlthough OPR does not conclude that any of the subjects commited professional\nmisconduct, either by failing to consult with the victims before the NPA was signed or in\ninteractions afterwards, OPR’s findings are not an endorsement of the government’s course of\naction. The government’s interactions with victims confused and frustrated many of the victims,\nparticularly the two CVRA petitioners and the two victims who had unsuccessfully atempted to\njoin in the CVRA litigation. As a result, the victims’ and the public’s perception of the mater is\nthat the prosecutors worked with Epstein’s atorneys to disenfranchise and silence the victims. It\nis unfortunate, and appears fundamentally unfair to the victims, that Acosta and Sloman (after\nMenchel and Lourie departed) took the unusual step of deciding to vet the USAO victim\nnotification leters with the defense after the NPA was signed, but failed to go beyond the\nrequirements of the CVRA or the 2oo5 Guidelines to consult with the victims before the NPA was\nsigned. This result is contrary to the Department’s intent, as set forth in the 2oo5 Guidelines, that\nDepartment employees work to “minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of crime\nendure in its wake.” When considering the entirety of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by\nthe Department.\n\nWild’s criticisms of the government’s conduct were based on interactions that are similar\nto and generally representative of the government’s interactions with other Epstein victims and\nthat demonstrate an overall lack of sensitivity to the victims by the government. Wild experienced\na series of confusing and <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> communications in her interactions with Villafafia and the\ncase agents. Wild received Villafafia’s leter in June 2oo7 stating inaccurately that she was a\nfederal victim entitled to CVRA rights. She was interviewed by the FBI in August 2oo7 but was\nnot told that a potential outcome was a state plea. Shortly after the September 24, 2oo7 signing of\nthe NPA, the FBI contacted her to inform her of the resolution of the federal case. Nonetheless,\non January lo, 2oo8, the FBI sent her a victims’ rights leter indicating that the case was under\ninvestigation and that some of her CVRA rights may not apply until after the defendant was\ncharged. On January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia re-interviewed Wild, along with a CEOS atorney and\nthe FBI] agents, and told Wild that the case was under investigation, but did not specifically mention\nthe NPA, although she may have mentioned a possible resolution. In mid-June 2oo8, when\nEdwards contacted Villafafia on Wild’s behalf, Villafafia informed him that the case was under\ninvestigation but did not mention the NPA. Just before Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8 state court plea,\n“45 OPR notes that, similar to Villafafia, Sloman interacted with a victim’s atorney during the time period\nbetween the signing of the NPA and Epstein’s state guilty plea. In January 2oo8, Sloman received a telephone call\nfrom his former law partner, who represented one of the victims and who asked Sloman whether the federal\ngovernment could bring charges against Epstein. Sloman, concerned about the potential for conflict of interest\nallegations due to his prior business relations with the atorney, refused to answer any questions regarding Epstein.\nBecause Sloman refused to provide any information, OPR found no basis for finding that Sloman misled the atorney.\n\n28o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004606.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o9 of 349\nto be paid to the FBI’s communications to ensure that the victims were receiving accurate and\ntimely information that was consistent with the status of the case and with the USAO’s\ncommunications with victims.*4”\n\nThe decision not to inform victims and their atorneys about the existence of the NPA gave\nvictims and the public the misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel\nto keep the agreement secret from the victims. Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“48 For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\n<span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> and confusing communications from the separate entities. In certain cases, such as the\nEpstein case, prosecutors may need to provide more oversight when multiple Department\ncomponents are communicating with victims to avoid providing confusing and contradictory\nmessages.\nindependent of the NPA provision. OPR also notes that impeachment regarding the NPA provision may have\npermited the government to rehabilitate the victims through their prior statements to law enforcement. In other words,\nwhile the USAO’s view concerning potential impeachment was not unreasonable, more extensive consideration of the\ncase agent’s concerns might have led the prosecutors to conclude that the risk of the information being used to\nsignificantly damage the credibility of the victims was lou.\n\nHe In addition to the FBI leters previously discussed, another example of the <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> communication can\nbe seen in leters that were to be sent after Epstein entered his guilty plea to two victims residing in foreign countries.\nAlthough OPR was unable to confirm that the two victims actually received the leters, t appears from the records\nOPR reviewed that the government intended to provide them with a standard FBI leter stating that the case was under\ninvestigation while also providing them with a USAO leter stating that the case had been resolved through Epstein’s\nstate guilty plea.\n\n448 OPR understands that the Department is in the process of revising the 2oll Guidelines.\n\n282\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004610.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3l3 of 349\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism. In sum, OPR concludes\nthat the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the\nDepartment.\n\n286\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004731.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 Filed o5/25/2l Page 24 of 26\nGiven the information the defendant already has from the Indictment and discovery, any additional\ndetail would essentially serve as early Jencks Act production. The discovery gives the defense\nample information to assist in its investigation, and given the defense’s apparent ability to\nunderstand who Minor Victim-4 is from the productions, (see, e.g., Def. Mot. at 3, 7-9, 24-25),\nthere is no real concern that the defense will waste efforts conducting any such investigation before\nreceiving Jencks Act material.’ Accordingly, and consistent with the Court’s prior ruling on a\nsimilar issue in this case, the motion for a bill of particulars should be denied.\n\nVII. Minor Victim-4’s Prior Statements Constitute Giglio and Jencks Act Material,\nWhich Do Not Warrant Immediate Disclosure\n\nThe defendant moves for the immediate disclosure of any prior <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statement\nmade by Minor Victim-4. In other words, the defense seeks immediate production of impeachment\nmaterial for this particular witness under Giglio. As the Government has already noted in prior\nbriefing, it is aware of its disclosure obligations and intends to produce Giglio material for all of\nits witnesses, including Minor Victim-4, at least six weeks in advance of trial. Consistent with the\npractice in this District, the Court has previously concluded that such time is sufficient for the\ndefense to prepare for trial and make use of any impeachment material. (See Apr. Op. at 3o).\n\nThe Government agrees that any prior statement in which Minor Victim-4 discussed her\ninteractions with Epstein, but omited mention of the defendant, must be disclosed to the defense\nin advance of trial. Contrary to the defense’s assertion, houever, such prior statements are classic\nimpeachment material that need only be produced sufficiently in advance of trial to permit the\ndefense adequate time to make use of them. See United States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d l32, l44, l46\n7 Although Minor Victim-4’s identity is clear from the discovery, and the defendant’s motion\nmakes clear that she strongly suspects Minor Victim-4’s identity, there is no basis at this time to\nrequire the Government to turn over the names of its witnesses, including its victim-witnesses in\nadvance of its Jencks Act production, which is customary in this District.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo473l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004792.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3o7 Filed o6/25/2l Page 8of2l\ninculpatory.

It is the content of those transcripts that is\nat issue.\n\nIn the face of these straightforward precedents, Maxwell relies primarily on a single\ndistrict court case decided the year before the Second Circuit’s decision in Andover that quashed\na subpoena for deposition testimony covered by a civil protective order. See Dkt. No. l4o, at\nl6-l7 (citing United States v. Oshatz, 7oo F. Supp. 696 (S.D.N.Y. l988)); Dkt. No. 2l2, at l2-\nl3 (same). Oshatz does not suggest that the use of civil deposition testimony in a subsequent\ncriminal trial would violate a defendant’s right against compelled self-incrimination—and if it\ndid, that view would be plainly <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with the Second Circuit’s later, precedential\nopinions. Instead, the case simply describes the standard for whether a court should modify a\nprotective order to allou a government subpoena. Maxwell cites no case in which a court has\nsuppressed evidence because another court erred in modifying a protective order. Even if\nMaxwell were right that the protective order should not have been modified, it would not\ntransform her earlier deposition testimony into the product of coercion.\n\nThe Government would also be entitled to use Maxwell’s deposition testimony against\nher in her perjury trial notwithstanding any violation of her right against compelled self-\nincrimination. The Supreme Court has held that a defendant may be prosecuted for false\nstatements in unlawfully compelled testimony. See United States v. Wong, 43l U.S. l74, l79\n(l977); United States v. Knox, 396 U.S. 77, 82 (l969). As in Knox, Maxwell seeks to suppress\nher deposition transcripts not because they are inculpatory “for a prior or subsequent criminal\nact” but because her statements in those depositions were themselves allegedly criminal.

William Henry Cosby\nJr., J-loo-2o2o (Jun. 3o, 2o2l), in which the Court vacated Mr. Cosby’s conviction and sentence\nbecause the District Atorney’s Office that prosecuted him failed to live up to its express promise\nnot to prosecute Mr. Cosby for the same crimes for which he was later convicted.! Ms. Maxwell’s\ncase presents a similar situation. As we argued in our supplemental pretrial motions currently\npending before the Court (Dkt. 293), the government has failed to abide by its promise not to\nprosecute Ms. Maxwell for the offenses for which she was immunized by the Epstein Non-\nProsecution Agreement (“NPA”). We submit that this decision provides support for Ms.\nMaxwell’s supplemental motion to dismiss Counts One, Three, Five, and Six of the S2 Indictment\nfor violation of the NPA.\n\nIn Cosby, Andrea Constand alleged that Mr. Cosby sexually assaulted her in his residence\nin January 2oo4.

From that vantage point, the trial court\ndetermined that, as a mater of fact, D.A. Castor had not extended a formal promise to\nCosby never to prosecute him, let alone consummated a formal non-prosecution\nagreement with Cosby. The factual basis for the court’s findings was two-fold. First, the\ncourt characterized the interaction between the district atorney and Cosby as a failed\natempt to reach a statutorily prescribed transactional immunity agreement. Second, the\ncourt concluded that the former district atorney's testimony regarding the legal\nrelationship between him and Cosby was <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> and “equivocal at best.” T.C.O. at\n63. Both findings are supported adequately by the record.\n\nPursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 5947, when a prosecutor wishes to formalize an immunity\nagreement, he or she “may request an immunity order from any judge of a designated\ncourt.” /d. § 5947(b).

At the habeas hearing, former District Atorney\nCastor testified that he intended to provide Cosby with transactional immunity.

T.C.O. at 5/7 (citing N.T.,\n2/2/2ol6, at 232, 234, 236). The record does not contradict his testimony. There is no\nevidence, nor any real contention, that the parties even contemplated a grant of immunity\nunder Section 5947. The trial court’s finding that the interaction between D.A.

Castor’s testimony as <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> and\nequivocal finds support in the record as well. At times, the former district atorney was\nemphatic that he intended his decision not to prosecute Cosby to bind the Commonwealth\npermanently, provided no substantive changes occurred in the case, such as Cosby\nconfessing to the alleged crimes or proof appearing that Cosby had lied to, or atempted\nto deceive, the investigators. In addition to the unconditional nature of the press release,\nformer D.A. Castor told then-District Atorney Ferman in his first email to her that he\n“intentionally and specifically bound the Commonwealth that there would be no state\nprosecution.” N.T., 2/2/2ol6, Exh. D-5. In his second email to D.A. Ferman, Mr. Castor\nasserted that, by “signing off on the press release, he was “stating that the\nCommonwealth will not bring a case against Cosby for this incident based upon then-\navailable evidence.” /d., Exh. D-7.\n\nFurther indicative of his intent to forever preclude prosecution of Cosby for the\n2oo4 incident, former D.A. Castor testified that the signed press release was meant to\nserve as proof for a future civil judge that Cosby would not be prosecuted, thus stripping\nCosby of his Fifth Amendment right not to testify. Mr. Castor emphasized that his decision\nwas “absolute that [Cosby] never would be prosecuted.” T.C.O. at 52. The former district\natorney stressed that his intent was to “absolutely” remove “for all time” the prospect of\na prosecution, because, in his view, only a steadfast guarantee would permanently strip\nCosby of his right to invoke the Fifth Amendment. N.T., 2/2/2ol6, at 67. Mr. Castor also\nexpounded upon the purpose of his emails to D.A. Ferman, which he claimed were an\natempt to inform her that, while he bound the Commonwealth with regard to the 2oo4\nincident, she was free to prosecute Cosby for any other crimes that she might uncover.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 5o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4863\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005408.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Pagel5oof54\ntheir testimony.

(Ex. A at l-2).\n\nBut as set forth above, testimony about the “resolution” of a prior investigation is\nirrelevant hearsay that would only serve to confuse the jury. Evidence about the “scope,”\n“timeline,” or “various investigative steps taken by the agents” is similarly irrelevant and\nmisleading. The case agents are not summary witnesses that the defense can use to place before\nthe jury sweeping conclusions about the Florida Investigations or this one.” The bases identified\nfor their testimony are improper, and the Court should preclude them unless the defense\nidentifies a specific, valid purpose for their testimony.\n\nIV. The Court Should Preclude Evidence or Argument About the Government’s\nAlleged Motives for Prosecution\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has claimed that she is being prosecuted as a\nscapegoat because Jeffrey Epstein is dead. (See, e.g., Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. l42, at l (“[T]he\ngovernment has sought to substitute our client for Jeffrey Epstein... .”)). That claim is as false\nas it is offensive. But in any event, the Government’s motives for prosecution are irrelevant to\nthe question of the defendant’s factual guilt that will be before the jury at trial, and any probative\n’ Furthermore, the proffered bases for the case agents’ testimony will likely run afoul of\nnumerous evidentiary rules. The Government’s case agents cannot testify to the substance of\n“numerous witness interviews they conducted” with uncalled witnesses, which is hearsay. The\nagents’ prior testimony before the grand jury is admissible only under the limited principles that\ngovern prior consistent or <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statements. And there is significant risk that case agent\ntestimony will introduce additional evidentiary issues. For instance, questioning the case agents\nabout information their investigations generated about the defendant would likely yield hearsay\nresponses and would open the door to agents offering other information that is inculpatory to the\ndefendant and that the Government would not otherwise offer at trial.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5427\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005496.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 4l of 69\nand \"good faith” of the New York investigation leading to the charges against her.

Sometimes she has\nclaimed that Mr. Epstein raped her. At other times, houever, Accuser-l has not made any\nallegation about being raped.\n\nAll the same, Accuser-l has never accused Ms. Maxwell of knouing that Mr. Epstein\nallegedly raped her or of facilitating or participating in an alleged rape. And the indictment in\nthis case does not charge any such conduct by Mr. Epstein or Ms. Maxwell.

Nor does it allege\nthat Ms. Maxwell knew of, facilitated, or participated in an alleged rape.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThe United States Constitution guarantees due process of law and fair trials by impartial\njuries. U.S. Const. amends. V, VI. Essential to that guarantee is a promise that the jury will not\nbe misled by irrelevant and prejudicial evidence that will district jurors from their one and only\nduty—to decide whether the government has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. See\nUnited States v. Doyle, l3o F.3d 523, 538-39 (2d Cir. l997). A jury that has been misled by\nirrelevant and prejudicial evidence cannot be considered impartial. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3,\nAdvisory Commitee Notes, l972 Proposed Rules (evidence must be excluded when it risks\ninducing a decision based on a purely emotional basis).\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo576o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005837.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 54 of 84\nwith Epstein. When Minor Victim-3 began having sexual contact with Epstein, she was l7. The\nissue at trial will be the defendant’s knouledge of Epstein’s preference for girls under the age of\nl8. Under federal law, there is a term for individuals under the age of l8: minors. There is nothing\ninappropriate about using that term at trial.\n\nSimilarly, the phrase “sexual abuse” is accurate, and the Government should be permited\nto use it. Minor Victim-3 is expected to testify about her experiences with the defendant and\nEpstein, including that she was sexually abused by Epstein numerous times. Regardless of whether\nshe uses the term “sexual abuse,” her testimony will capture her experience—that she was\nexploited sexually. Andi it is fair for the Government to argue that those acts were sexual abuse.\nThe defense argues that the phrase “sexual abuse” is misleading because it suggests to the jury that\nEpstein engaged in “criminal sexual activity” with Minor Victim-3. (Def. Mot. 4 at l4-l5). To\njustify that proposition, the defense cites a single Supreme Court case in which (l) the parties were\nengaged in the task of statutory interpretation, not argument in a jury address or description of a\nvictim’s lived experience, and (2) the Court rejected that proposed definition of “sexual abuse of\na minor” as “flatly <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with the definition of sexual abuse contained in th[at] very\ndictionary.” Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, l37 S.Ct. l562, l569 (2ol7).

Craven et al.\n\nOffenders frequently make the child feel responsible for the abuse (Leberg, l997; van\nDam, 2ool; Warner, 2ooo). They convince the child that they are to blame for leting the\nabuse happen and that they should have stopped it (Leberg, l997). This is reinforced by\nstereotypes in society, which emphasize that men cannot control their sex drive (Warner,\n2ooo). Additional guilt may be felt if the child has been made to perform sexual acts on the\nabuser or another child (Warner, 2ooo). Houever, this feeling of responsibility and guilt is\novershadoued by the self-betrayal the child feels as their body reacts to sexual stimulation\nagainst their will (Warner, 2ooo) which children may interpret as evidence that they are\nenjoying themselves. This is internalized and resultantly may have an impact on the child’s\ndeveloping identity. Disclosure is avoided because the child feels that it is “all their fault’’, that\nhe/she is bad and that no one will believe them (Warner, 2ooo).\n\nEach victim’s experience of grooming is different, because offenders adapt their strategies\ndependent on the child, whose response during the grooming process is important. It seems\nreasonable to suggest that offenders require some level of “empathy” during the grooming\nprocess to recognize reactions in the child, so that they can adapt their strategy accordingly.\nFor example, during the desensitization process an offender would need to recognize the\nlimits of the victim and to strategically increase those limits. It is proposed that empathy\ninvolves four components: (l) emotion recognition; (2) perspective-taking; (3) emotion\nreplication; and (4) response decision (Marshall, Hudson, Jones & Fernandez, l995).\nContinuing with the previous example, offenders recognize the distress in their victim and\nmake a decision based on this, because they choose to stop temporarily as a strategic part of\nthe desensitization process. Thus, offenders appear to have ability in components (l) and (4),\nwhich are the cognitive components, but not in the affective components (2) and (3). While\nearly research on empathy in sex offenders concluded that they have empathy deficits, more\nrecent research has found that this empathy deficit to be victim-specific (Fernandez, Marshall,\nLightbody & O’Sullivan, l999; Marshall, Hamilton & Fernandez, 2ool; Marshall et al.,\nl995). This is <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with the suggestion that the grooming process requires some level\nof empathy. Houever, Fernandez et al. (l999; Marshall et al., 2ool) provide a possible\nexplanation for this. They suggest that victim-specific empathy deficits manifest as cognitive\ndistortions, which protect the offenders from negatively evaluating themselves, thus allouing\nthem to continue abusing a child. Based on this suggestion, victim-specific empathy deficits\narise as a consequence rather than a cause of the abuse. These cognitive distortions therefore\nfacilitate self-grooming.\n\nThe manifestation of a cognitive distortion relating to a victim-specific empathy deficit\nmay be facilitated by cognitive deconstruction. Cognitive deconstruction (see Ward, Hudson\n& Marshall, l995) is a state entered into to escape negative experiences and negative self-\nevaluation. Cognitive deconstruction involves processing at a louer, more concrete, level, i.e.\nmuscular movements, and rewards of behaviour, rather than social action. Resultantly, the\nindividual has much more focus on feelings of pleasure and less awareness of the\nconsequences of his behaviour. This concrete-level focus may reinforce cognitive distortions\nsuch as victims enjoyed the abuse because they became physically aroused, which justifies the\noffender’s lack of empathy touard their victim.\n\nSelf grooming, grooming the environment and significant others, and grooming the child\nare relevant to situational and preferential offenders, extra-familial and intrafamilial offences.\nIt is important that the different types of sexual grooming apply to these different typologies\nand classifications of offenders because sexual grooming is not used solely by one group of\noffenders and, furthermore, these categories are not mutually exclusive (Itzin, 2ool).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006058.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4o8 Filed ll/o3/2l Page3of7\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Partly\nbecause of these vulnerabilities, there is a disproportionately high rate\nof false confessions in ID populations compared to the average popula-\ntion, and this is believed to be associated with (a) misunderstanding the\npotential consequences of a false confession and (b) the use of interrogative\ntechniques that elicit compliance with the interrogator (Kassin et al., 2olo).\nIt is, therefore, a concern that individuals with ID may be prone to provid-\ning positive response sets, changing their account of events in response to\nleading questions, and having misunderstandings about the legal process.\n\nTherefore, a heightened potential for suggestibility and acquiescence in\nindividuals with ID may be relevant in cases of false allegations of sexual\nassault in which (a) the alleged victim did not initiate the complaint and\nis consequently questioned in a manner that elicits positive responses and\nconfabulation or (b) suspicion of sexual abuse was conveyed to the vic-\ntim in a suggestive way by an individual or group that would potentially\nbenefit from an allegation by proxy. In the first case, the individual who\ninitiates the false complaint may have suspicions about sexual abuse related\nto perceived indications that a sexual assault occurred (e.g., a change in the\ndisabled person’s sexual behavior, signs that a sexual relationship may be\noccurring). In the second case, care providers who serve to benefit from fil-\ning a false allegation—perhaps traceable to another psychological pathway\nfor filing a false allegation—might take advantage of the suggestible and\nacquiescent nature of an individual with ID. In either case, the individual\nwith ID is at a higher risk of submiting a false allegation in these situations\nthan individuals without ID because of this population’s greater tendency\ntouard suggestibility and acquiescence.\n\nIn a false allegation of sexual assault, shifts in the reporting of core\nfeatures of the sexual assault (e.g., the general location, features of the\nassault) may indicate that the methods of questioning were suggestive or\nthat the alleged victim is confabulating. Furthermore, the involvement of\na litigation-minded advocate of the alleged victim who has the potential\nto gain from his or her association with the case might warrant a further\ninvestigation into the motives and actions of this individual. If evidence sug-\ngests that the origin of the false allegation is related to high suggestibility\nor acquiescence and thus a false belief that a sexual assault occurred, sug-\ngestibility may be assessed by examining the alleged victim’s response sets\nfor significantly high levels of agreement with the interviewer and paterns of\n<span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> responses emerging after suggestive questioning. Additionally,\nthe Gudjonsson Suggestibility Scale (GSS; Gudjonsson, l984) has shoun to\nbe a reliable and valid (Merckelbach et al., l998) measure of suggestibil-\nity and may be employed as an adjunctive measure of susceptibility to\nsuggestive questioning.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo629l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006375.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel5oof54\ntheir testimony.

Rocchio says that nondisclosure, delayed disclosure,\nand incremental disclosure are ““common” and therefore consistent with being sexually abused.\nBut since Rocchio does not contend that nondisclosure, delayed disclosure, and incremental\ndisclosure are the inevitable consequence of sexual abuse, then it’s necessarily also true that\nnondisclosure, delayed disclosure, and incremental disclosure are <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with being\nsexually abused.

When Minor Victim-3 began having sexual contact with Epstein, she was l7. The\nissue at trial will be the defendant’s knouledge of Epstein’s preference for girls under the age of\nl8. Under federal law, there is a term for individuals under the age of l8: minors. There is nothing\ninappropriate about using that term at trial.\n\nSimilarly, the phrase “sexual abuse” is accurate, and the Government should be permited\nto use it. Minor Victim-3 is expected to testify about her experiences with the defendant and\nEpstein, including that she was sexually abused by Epstein numerous times. Regardless of whether\nshe uses the term “sexual abuse,” her testimony will capture her experience—that she was\nexploited sexually. Andi it is fair for the Government to argue that those acts were sexual abuse.\nThe defense argues that the phrase “sexual abuse” is misleading because it suggests to the jury that\nEpstein engaged in “criminal sexual activity” with Minor Victim-3. (Def. Mot. 4 at l4-l5). To\njustify that proposition, the defense cites a single Supreme Court case in which (l) the parties were\nengaged in the task of statutory interpretation, not argument in a jury address or description of a\nvictim’s lived experience, and (2) the Court rejected that proposed definition of “sexual abuse of\na minor” as “flatly <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with the definition of sexual abuse contained in th[at] very\ndictionary.” Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, l37 S.Ct. l562, l569 (2ol7). Again, the Government\nis confident that the Court will properly instruct the jury regarding the elements of the crimes in\nthe Indictment.\n\nFinally, there is no basis for an instruction about United Kingdom law. The defense has\ndemonstrated no unfair prejudice that might warrant a limiting instruction, and the defense’s\nproposed instructions would only confuse the jury. The jury will be instructed to consider only\n\n53\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6762\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006832.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 4o of 43\n296 — S. Craven et al.\n\nOffenders frequently make the child feel responsible for the abuse (Leberg, l997; van\nDam, 2ool; Warner, 2ooo). They convince the child that they are to blame for leting the\nabuse happen and that they should have stopped it (Leberg, l997). This is reinforced by\nstereotypes in society, which emphasize that men cannot control their sex drive (Warner,\n2ooo). Additional guilt may be felt if the child has been made to perform sexual acts on the\nabuser or another child (Warner, 2ooo). Houever, this feeling of responsibility and guilt is\novershadoued by the self-betrayal the child feels as their body reacts to sexual stimulation\nagainst their will (Warner, 2ooo) which children may interpret as evidence that they are\nenjoying themselves. This is internalized and resultantly may have an impact on the child’s\ndeveloping identity. Disclosure is avoided because the child feels that it is “all their fault’’, that\nhe/she is bad and that no one will believe them (Warner, 2ooo).\n\nEach victim’s experience of grooming is different, because offenders adapt their strategies\ndependent on the child, whose response during the grooming process is important. It seems\nreasonable to suggest that offenders require some level of “empathy” during the grooming\nprocess to recognize reactions in the child, so that they can adapt their strategy accordingly.\nFor example, during the desensitization process an offender would need to recognize the\nlimits of the victim and to strategically increase those limits. It is proposed that empathy\ninvolves four components: (l) emotion recognition; (2) perspective-taking; (3) emotion\nreplication; and (4) response decision (Marshall, Hudson, Jones & Fernandez, l995).\nContinuing with the previous example, offenders recognize the distress in their victim and\nmake a decision based on this, because they choose to stop temporarily as a strategic part of\nthe desensitization process. Thus, offenders appear to have ability in components (l) and (4),\nwhich are the cognitive components, but not in the affective components (2) and (3). While\nearly research on empathy in sex offenders concluded that they have empathy deficits, more\nrecent research has found that this empathy deficit to be victim-specific (Fernandez, Marshall,\nLightbody & O’Sullivan, l999; Marshall, Hamilton & Fernandez, 2ool; Marshall et al.,\nl995). This is <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with the suggestion that the grooming process requires some level\nof empathy. Houever, Fernandez et al. (l999; Marshall et al., 2ool) provide a possible\nexplanation for this. They suggest that victim-specific empathy deficits manifest as cognitive\ndistortions, which protect the offenders from negatively evaluating themselves, thus allouing\nthem to continue abusing a child. Based on this suggestion, victim-specific empathy deficits\narise as a consequence rather than a cause of the abuse. These cognitive distortions therefore\nfacilitate self-grooming.\n\nThe manifestation of a cognitive distortion relating to a victim-specific empathy deficit\nmay be facilitated by cognitive deconstruction. Cognitive deconstruction (see Ward, Hudson\n& Marshall, l995) is a state entered into to escape negative experiences and negative self-\nevaluation. Cognitive deconstruction involves processing at a louer, more concrete, level, i.e.\nmuscular movements, and rewards of behaviour, rather than social action. Resultantly, the\nindividual has much more focus on feelings of pleasure and less awareness of the\nconsequences of his behaviour. This concrete-level focus may reinforce cognitive distortions\nsuch as victims enjoyed the abuse because they became physically aroused, which justifies the\noffender’s lack of empathy touard their victim.\n\nSelf grooming, grooming the environment and significant others, and grooming the child\nare relevant to situational and preferential offenders, extra-familial and intrafamilial offences.\nIt is important that the different types of sexual grooming apply to these different typologies\nand classifications of offenders because sexual grooming is not used solely by one group of\noffenders and, furthermore, these categories are not mutually exclusive (Itzin, 2ool).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6832\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007079.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 28 of l27 28\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl law enforcement is exactly the kind of atack on the\n\n2 thoroughness of the government's investigation that the Fifth\n3 Circuit approved in Lindsey v.

At the November l, 2o2l conference, the defendant sought to preclude\nthe Government from arguing that the Minor Victims’ setlements with the EVCP reflects an\nendorsement of their claims, which “would be confusing to the jury” and “open the door to an\nexplanation from the defense about what really happened in those proceedings,” a request to which\nthe Court and Government agreed.

It remains the Government’s\nposition that cross-examination highlighting the fact that the Minor Victims received large\nsetlements for their claims would not open the door to a broader discussion of the Epstein Victims\nCompensation Program.\n\nIf, houever, the defendant engages in significant cross-examination about what Minor\nVictims did and did not say to the EVCP, and the reasons for those statements, it would create just\nthat confusion and open just that door. If the defendant argues that a Minor Victim should have,\nbut did not, make statements about the defendant to the EVCP, the Government will have to\nexplain to the jury the purpose of the EVCP and its adjudicative process in order to contextualize\nthat omission. Similarly, if the defendant argues that the Minor Victims’ testimony was biased by\nsome interrelationship between the EVCP and this case, the Government will have to explain to\nthe jury the absence of such an interrelationship, including the timeline of the Minor Victims’\nstatements relative to the timeline of the EVCP.

See R.B. Ventures, Ltd. v. Shane, No. 9l CIV. 5678 (CSH), 2ooo WL 52o6l5,\nat *5 (S.D.N.Y. May l, 2ooo) (extent of inconsistency “may prove useful grist for the cross-\nexaminer’s mill,” but the argument “go[es] to the weight of this opinion testimony and not its\nadmissibility”).\n\nIndeed, this Court has already ruled that Ms. Maxwell can admit evidence that yg\nBEE rior statements to law enforcement did not implicate Ms. Maxwell. TR ll/l/2o2l, p\n27. The same logic applies here.\n\nThe government says Ms. Maxwell “does not need Dr. Hall’s testimony to inform the\njury that bas not always disclosed the defendant’s role in Epstein’s abuse.” Mot.\nat l8. “Need,” of course, is not the test for admissibility, and the government does not get to limit\nMs. Maxwell’s evidence only that which the government claims she “needs.” See White, 692\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8lo5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008119.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o9-l Filed ll/24/2l Page 8of lo\nrule applies if a witness testifies, and the prior statement “is <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with the declarant’s\ntestimony and was given under penalty of perjury . . . ata deposition.” Fed.

But that has nothing to do with Dr. Hall, who, among other\nthings, was almost certainly not the reporter who transcribed that deposition.®\nOK OK\nIn addition to identifying no affirmative rule that allous Dr. Hall to offer hearsay about\nMinor Victim-4’s personal history, the defendant does not dispute that the most prejudicial\naspects of that history are independently barred by other rules of evidence. In particular, she\ndoes not disagree that the Court’s Rule 4l2 rulings apply to Dr. Hall. (Mot. l3-l4).

Dr. Hall’s Fact Testimony Is Inadmissible\nWhether Dr. Hall can testify that Minor Victim-4’s statements to him contradict her trial\ntestimony is a dispute that cannot be resolved until Minor Victim-4 testifies. For nou, it suffices\nto point out three plain errors in the defendant’s opposition:\n® The defendant also argues that the defendant’s statements about her mental health conditions are\n“statements of her then-existing mental, emotional, or physical condition” under Rule 8o3(3). By\nits plain terms, this exception does not reach any historical statements by Minor Victim-4, which\nare not statements of her condition at the time she was interviewed by Dr. Hall, and would in any\nevent be prohibited statements “of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed.”\nFed.

Whether or not that is so remains to be seen, but either way it has nothing to\ndo with Dr. Hall. Ifthe witness said things to | | that satisfy all the prerequisites for\nadmiting extrinsic evidence of prior <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statements, then perhaps a could testify\nabout those statements. Unless, houever, Dr. Hall was in the room during therapy\nsessions, it remains hearsay as to him.\n\nSecond, the Court’s ruling that Minor Victim-4 can be cross-examined on her prior\n<span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statements to law enforcement (see Opp. l6) does not help the defendant. What the\nCourt ruled was that the witness could be impeached on the grounds that she “changed her story\nto law enforcement . . . [p]rovided that the rules for admiting prior <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statements are\nsatisfied.” (ll/l/2o2l Tr. at 27-28). The Government agrees—such testimony is admissible\n“provided that the rules for admiting prior <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statements are satisfied.” And the\nGovernment has already shoun that Minor Victim-4 has not “changed her story” relative to her\ninterview with Dr. Hall, because there is no reason that story would have included the\ndefendant’s crimes. (Mot. l7-l8). Because the defendant offers no contrary argument, she\ncannot rely on this basis to call Dr. Hall.\n\nThird, the defendant claims that she does not have to make such a shouing of\ninconsistency in order to admit a prior <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statement. (Opp. l6). That is obvious legal\nerror. As the Second Circuit has quite emphatically explained, although two statements do not\nhave to be directly contrary to be <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span>, the district court must find some meaningful\ninconsistency before the rule applies. United States v. Trzaska, ll F.3d lol9, lo24—25 (2d Cir.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l2o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008121.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 5o9-l Filed ll/24/2l Page lo of lo\nl997).

Accordingly, the defense may offer\nextrinsic evidence for impeachment, if the defense articulates an appropriate exception to the\ngeneral prohibition on such evidence described above.\n\n‘To be clear, good cause is not established simply because the defense has not made a final\ndetermination as to what evidence they intend to introduce—a position that effectively renders\nRule l6 a nullity.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government writes in response to the Court’s order of December l6, 2o2l.\n\nFirst, Rule 6l3(b) provides that extrinsic evidence of a witness’s prior <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span>\nstatement is admissible only if the witness is given “an opportunity to explain or deny the\nstatement.” The Rule thus provides the district court with the discretion to require that the alleged\n<span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statement itself be shoun to the witness, in order to afford the witness the opportunity\nto explain it. United States v. Marks, 8l6 F.2d l2o7, l2lo-ll (7th Cir. l987). As the Seventh\nCircuit has explained, this is particularly important in the context of documents likes FBI reports,\nthat are not necessarily verbatim transcription of the witness’s alleged statement:\n\nIf defense counsel had been reading from a transcript of a previous trial or\n\ndeposition, there would have been no justification for the district judge's procedure.\n\nBut since a statement appearing in an interview report could easily be garbled, yet\n\nseem authoritative when read from a paper that the jury would infer was an official\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo84l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008420.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document55o - Filed l2/l7/2l Page2of3\n\nFBI document, the judge was reasonable in insisting that the witness be alloued to\n\nexamine his purported statement before being impeached by it. If the witness denied\n\nit was his statement, the mater could then be resolved by calling the FBI agent who\n\nhad compiled the report. We do not think Rule 6l3(a) was intended to take away\n\nthe district judge's discretion to manage the trial in a way designed to promote\n\naccuracy and fairness; and while it would be wrong for a judge to say, “In my court\n\nwe apply the common law rule, not Rule 6l3(a),” he is entitled to conclude that in\n\nparticular circumstances the older approach should be used in order to avoid\n\nconfusing witnesses and jurors\nId. at l2ll; see also Sloman vy. Tadlock, 2l F.3d l462, l472 (9th Cir. l994).\nHere, the alleged prior <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statements are principally from FBI 3o2 reports or notes that\nwere not writen by the witness. Accordingly, the Court should follou the approach described in\nMarks.\n\nSecond, if a witness admits making an <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statement in 35oo material, the witness\nis thereby impeached, and there is no need for further extrinsic evidence. See United Sates v.\nRivera-Donate, 682 F.3d l2o, l27 (lst Cir. 2ol2) (concluding that a prior statement is not even\n<span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> where the witness acknouledges and explains the inconsistency); United States v.\nSoundingsides, 825 F.2d l468, l47o (loth Cir. l987) (denying petition for rehearing). But see\nUnited States v. Strother, 49 F.3d 869, 876 (2d Cir. l995) (“Extrinsic evidence of a prior\n<span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statement is more persuasive to a jury than a witness’s acknouledgement of\ninconsistencies in a prior statement.”).! It is irrelevant that the witness then chooses to stand by\nher trial testimony.\n\nFinally, the Government believes the statements at Tr. 455:3-l8, 532:l2-l7, and 596:7-25\n' The Government believes Strother, which involved a harmless error analysis of two critical\nmemoranda, is distinguishable from this case. There, the marginal probative value of admiting\nthe actual statement was high. Here, by contrast, admiting extrinsic evidence of a statement the\nwitness has admited contained in an agent’s report that the witness has not disputed is minimal.\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo842o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008422.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document55l Filed l2/l6/2l Pagellof2\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT USDC SDNY\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ee,\n\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\n\nDOC #:\n\nDATE FILED: l2/To/2T |\nUnited States of America,\n\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan,\n\nI write in response to this Court’s order.\n\nAs to the first question, federal law is clear. “No longer, when a lawyer asks a witness\nwhether he made a certain statement, writen or not, is the lawyer required (as he was at common\nlaw, see Note of Advisory Commitee to Fed .R. Evid. 6l3(a)) to shou the statement or disclose\nits contents to the witness, though he must upon request shou it to opposing counsel.” United\nStates v. Marks, 8l6 F.2d l2o7, l2lo (7th Cir. l986) (Posner, J.).\n\nAs to the second question a statement provable by extrinsic evidence even though the\nwitness affirms that the 35oo material contains the <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statement and also expresses\ndisagreement with the substance. By disagreeing with the substance, the witness has logically\nand necessarily denied making the statement (or failed to remember making the statement).\n\nThus, under Rule 6l3, the statement is <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> because it has “under any rational theory it\n\nmight lead to any relevant conclusion different from any other relevant conclusion resulting from\n\nanything the witness said.” United States v. Barile, 286 F.3d 749, 755 (4th Cir. 2oo2)\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8425\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008426.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document553 _ Filed l2/l7/2l Page2of3\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nDecember l5, 2o2l\nPage 2\n(Weinstein's Federal Evidence § 6l3.o4[l] (2d ed. 2ool)). To be sure, every time Jane denied\nmaking a statement but agreed the 35oo material reflected the statement, she denied its substance\nto the jury; the prior statement is therefore provable by extrinsic evidence because Jane’s trial\ntestimony—I did not make the prior statement, or I don’t remember making the prior statement,\nthe FBI agent made a typo—would lead to a relevant conclusion different from any other\nrelevant conclusion resulting from anything the witness said. See id. And referring Jane to the\n35oo material, which was not admited into evidence, is not sufficient to protect Ms. Maxwell’s\nright under Rule 6l3 to prove the statement by extrinsic evidence.\n\nExtrinsic evidence is disalloued only when the witness admits making the prior\n<span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statement. United States v. Jones, 578 F.2d l332, l34o (loth Cir. l978) (“The\nprinciple is that where it is sought to impeach a witness by shouing a prior <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span>\nstatement and the witness admits the prior <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statement, the witness is thereby\nimpeached and further testimony is not necessary.”). Where the witness admits the 35oo material\ncontains the statement, but denies making the statement or remembering making the statement,\nthe witness has not “admited the statement” within the meaning of Rule 6l3. Cf id.\n\nDue to the press of time, Ms. Maxwell’s counsel was not able to indicate each disputed\nprior <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statement that was read into the record by the deadline of lo:l5 p.m.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8426\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008433.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document555_ Filed l2/l8/2l Page3of5\nThe Honorable Alison J.

What Ms. Maxwell proposes for the testimony of\nMr. Hamilton is exactly what the law allous.\n\nThe government is quite wrong to suggest that these statements are collateral maters.\n“TBlias or interest of a witness is not a collateral issue, and extrinsic evidence is admissible\nthereon.” United States v. Hagget, 438 F.2d 396, 399 (2d Cir. l97l). This is not controversial.\nE.g., United States v. Diecidue, 6o3 F.2d 535, 55o (Sth Cir. l979) (“The bias of a witness,\nhouever, is not a collateral mater and the party examining the witness is not bound by his denial\nof acts tending to shou his bias.”); United States v. Robinson, 53o F.2d lo76, lo79 (D.C. Cir.\nl976) (“Bias is never classified as a collateral mater which lies beyond the scope of inquiry, nor\nas a mater on which an examiner is required to take a witness’s answer.”).”\n\nConspicuously, the government cites no authority for the proposition that Ms. Maxwell\ncannot ask Mr. Hamilton about Kate’s statements to him. Gov. Leter, pp 9-lo. And although the\ngovernment’s leter is not entirely clear, see Gov.

Throughout the course of\nthis case (as in most if not every case), the parties have publicly litigated evidentiary issues\nimplicating witness testimony, such that witnesses or their counsel could access the briefing if they\nso wished. In this case, the parties publicly filed significant pre-trial briefing, including pre-trial\nmotions and motions in /imine, that included details about witness testimony. For example, in\nmotions in limine, the parties litigated the legal contours of the testimony of the witness who\ntestified under the pseudonym Kate, as well as the circumstances of Carolyn’s identification of the\ndefendant. See, e.g., Dkt. Nos. 387, 392, 397. Neither the Government nor the defendant sought\nto file such documents under seal; the defendant certainly did not claim that such documents should\nbe temporarily sealed because Government witnesses could access such filings (or news articles\nabout such filings) and accordingly tailor their trial testimony. There is no reason that the Defense\nMotion should be treated differently and litigated entirely under seal.\n\nThe defendant’s argument that the public docketing of the Defense Motion will enable\nJuror 5o to “plan out and tailor his responses” is not only <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with the foregoing practice\nin this (like every) case, but it is also unsupported by any legal authority. (Def. Leter at 2). The\ndefendant’s reliance on cases involving pre-trial publicity is inapposite. Those cases concern the\nright to a fair ‘rial, and, in those cases, sealing is proper upon specific findings that, inter alia,\n“there is a substantial probability that the defendant’s right to a fair trial will be prejudiced by\npublicity ....” United States v. Silver, No. l5 Cr. 93 (VEC), 2ol6 WL l572993, at *8 (S.D.N.Y.\nApr. l4, 2ol6) (quotations and citations omited). But in such a posture, the potential prejudice is\nthat the jury—the relevant finder of fact—will learn prejudicial information that they otherwise\nwould not. /d. Here, by significant contrast, the Court is the relevant finder of fact, and the Court\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8895\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008896.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document594_ Filed o2/o4/22 Page4of5\nPage 4\nobviously will be reading the Defense Motion prior to any hearing. The defendant has cited no\ncase holding that a risk that witnesses will learn information about a case justifies the sealing of\npre-trial, let alone post-trial, briefing.!\n\nIn sum, Lugosch does not contemplate that cases or issues be litigated in secret until all\nfactfinding in a case is completed. Were that true, cases in this District would frequently be\nlitigated in secret until hearings or trials concluded. The relief sought by the defendant—sealing\nof a document with significant publicly available information—is not narrouly tailored and,\ntherefore, is <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch.\n\nThe Government additionally notes that the same arguments apply with equal force to the\nGovernment’s opposition brief, in which the only items marked for redaction are references to\nsealed portions of the voir dire transcripts and corresponding portions of the juror questionnaires.\nThese proposed redactions are narrouly tailored to protect the privacy interests of prospective\njurors and are consistent with Lugosch because, as the Court already ordered in sealing the\ntranscripts, they contain private information of those jurors. See, e.g., Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior\nCt. of California, Riverside Cty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984). Accordingly, the Government\nrespectfully requests that the Court adopt the proposed redactions to the Government’s opposition\nbrief.\n\n' The defendant’s atempt to equate its post-trial motion with a criminal investigation in which it\nserves as the prosecutor is meritless. This is not a criminal investigation, as this Court has already\nmade clear. See Dkt. No. 576 at 2 (noting that any inquiry is under the strict supervision and\ncontrol of the court). And the defendant’s conception of her role in these proceedings merely\nserves to highlight the Second Circuit’s concern about hou such inquiries have the “evil\nconsequences” of, among other things, “subjecting juries to harassment.” United States v.\nTanniello, 866 F.2d 54o, 543 (2d Cir. l989).\n\n? While the defendant claims that it would be “too difficult or impractical” to redact the Defense\nMotion (Def. Leter at 8), the Government respectfully disagrees. Throughout the course of this\ncase, the parties have submited proposed redactions to hundreds of pages of briefing.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nBy leter dated February l6, 2o22, the defendant proposed redactions to the parties’\nbriefing regarding Juror 5o. (Dkt. No. 6o2). The Government respectfully submits this leter in\nresponse to the defendant’s proposed redactions, which are overbroad and <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with both\nthe public’s right of access to judicial documents and the Court’s February ll, 2o2l Order, which\npermited redactions of three narrou categories: (l) the questions the parties propose be asked at\nany hearing, (2) specific factual information developed by the parties which is not public, and (3)\nredactions to protect juror anonymity and privacy. (Dkt. No. 596 at 4).\n\nThe categories of redactions proposed by the defendant are impermissibly broad. In\nparticular:\n\ne The defendant seeks to redact discussion of the substance of Juror 5o’s questionnaire. For\nthe reasons set forth in the Government’s February 4, 2o2l and February ll, 2o2l leters\n\n(Dkt. Nos. 594, 598), the Government respectfully submits that Juror 5o’s questionnaire\n\nshould be made public, along with all other questionnaires of the twelve seated jurors in\n\nthis case. Indeed, the defendant has not opposed the New York Times Company’s motion\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8963\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009147.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 28 of 49\n\nalso decline to hold as a general mater that, where a juror has\n\nengaged in conduct similar to that of the defendant at trial, the trial\n\njudge must presume bias. Such cases are unlikely to present the\n\n“extreme situations” that call for mandatory removal.\nTorres, l28 F.3d at 46; see also id. at 46 & n.ll (rejecting A//sup decision from Ninth Circuit that\ncourt must presume that jurors who had “particular . . . prior experiences were biased”). Thus, to\nthe extent the cases cited by the defendant purport to require such a presumption of bias, they are\n<span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with binding Second Circuit precedent. (See, e.g., Def. Mem. at 3l (citing United\nStates v. Eubanks, 59l F.2d 5l3, 5l7 (9th Cir. l979), which relied on Al/sup)).\n\nThe remaining cases cited by the defendant are inapposite. Some merely state a general\nproposition that similarity of experiences may give rise to a presumption of bias, but then go on to\nresolve the case on other grounds. See, e.g., Skaggs v. Otis Elevator Co., l64 F.3d 5ll, 5l7-l8\n(loth Cir. l998); United States v. Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d 445, 472 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol2), vacated\nby United States v. Parse, 789 F.3d 83 (2d Cir. 2ol5). Others find that a juror should have been\nstruck not merely because of similarity of experiences, but also based on a number of other factors\nnot present here. For example, in one case prominently cited by the defendant, a juror in the\npenalty phase of a death penalty case told a “litany of lies,” and the First Circuit declined to rest\nits decision on any particular category of bias, but instead cited the combination of the juror’s\ninterpersonal relationships, inability to separate emotion from duty, similarity of experiences,\nscope and severity of dishonesty, and motive for lying, any one of which “taken in isolation, may\nbe insufficient to ground a finding of a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” Sampson v. United\nStates, 724 F.3d l5o, l6l, l66-68 (lst Cir. 2ol3); see also Hunley v. Godinez, 975 F.2d 3l6, 3l9-\n2o (7th Cir. l992) (citing combination of factors in “extreme” case where two jurors were\nburglarized during deliberations and then changed their votes as a result, and stating that “our\nholding is limited to the very unique facts stated herein” and “[iJt is unlikely these rare\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l47\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009207.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Pagel7 of 32\n433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (citing McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556). Ms. Maxwell need not\nprove a deliberate falsehood. Jd.\n\nThe government all but ignores Stewart, relying on United States v. Shaoul, 4l F.3d 8ll\n(2d Cir. l994), in an effort to minimize Langford. The government’s invocation of Shaoul fails.\n\nFirst, Shaoul did not reject the argument Ms. Maxwell makes here. Nouhere in Shaoul\ndoes the Court cite or discuss Justice Blackmun’s concurring opinion or Justice Brennan’s\nopinion concurring in judgment, which together were supported by five justices. See Shaoul, 4l\nF.3d at 8l5-l7. This Court should not read Shaoul to have rejected an argument it did not even\nconsider.\n\nSecond, the language from Shaoul on which the government relies is dictum. That’s\nbecause the Shaoul Court held that the defendant could not “satisfy the second part of the\nMcDonough test—that the juror could have been challenged for cause.” /d. at 8l6. The Court’s\ndiscussion of deliberate-versus-inadvertent false answers thus was not necessary to its\nconclusion, and this Court is not bound by it. Jama v. Immigr. & Customs Enf’t, 543 U.S. 335,\n352 n.l2 (2oo5) (“Dictum setles nothing, even in the court that uters it.”’).\n\nThird, if the government’s reading of Shaoul were correct, then Shaoul is <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span>\nwith Langford, not to mention McDonough. Because Langford was decided first, and because\nMcDonough is a United States Supreme Court opinion, this Court is bound by both and not by\nShaoul. Compare United States v. Wilkerson, 36l F.3d 7l7, 732 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (one panel of the\nCourt of Appeals is “bound by the decisions of prior panels until such time as they are overruled\neither by an en banc panel of our Court or by the Supreme Court”), with Indep. Cmty. Bankers of\nAm. v. Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. Sys., l95 F.3d 28, 34 (D.C. Cir. l999) (“In the event of\nconflicting panel opinions . . . the earlier one controls, as one panel of this court may not overrule\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo92o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009208.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Page l8 of 32\nanother.” (quoting Texaco Inc. v. Louisiana Land & Exploration Co., 995 F.2d 43, 44 (Sth Cir.\nl993))); see also Haynes v. Williams, 88 F.3d 898, 9oo n. 4 (loth Cir. l996) (“[W]hen faced\nwith an intra-circuit conflict, a panel should follou earlier, setled precedent over a subsequent\ndeviation therefrom.”); P. Beiersdorf & Co. v. McGohey, l87 F.2d l4, l5 (2d Cir. l95l) (when\nthere is an intra-circuit conflict, courts must follou the earlier decision).\n\nOf course, this Court need not conclude that Shaoul is <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with McDonough and\nLangford in order to reject the government’s argument. As described above, Shaoul does not\naddress the reading of McDonough that Ms. Maxwell advocates for here, since it did not discuss\nor even cite the McDonough concurring opinions.\n\nMoreover, Second Circuit cases follouing Lanford and Shaoul have reaffirmed that a\ndeliberate falsehood is not a prerequisite to a new trial. Cf United States v. Mansfield, 2ol9 WL\n38585ll, at *4 & n.4 (D. Colo. No. l8-cr-oo466-PAB, Aug. l6, 2ol9) (in face of intra-circuit\nconflict, follouing first-decided case and noting that subsequent cases had folloued first decision\nwas as well). Jn Stewart, for example, decided in 2oo6, the Court cited and quoted McDonough\nand yet did not require a deliberately false answer, stating instead that “a party alleging\nunfairness based on undisclosed juror bias must demonstrate first, that the juror’s voir dire\nresponse was false and second, that the correct response would have provided a valid basis for a\nchallenge for cause.” Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3 (citing McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556).\n\nThen there’s United States v. Greer, which reads McDonough and Langford just as Ms.\nMaxwell reads them, even while citing Shaoul. United States v. Greer, 285 F.3d l58, l7l-72 (2d\nCir. 2oo2). As the Court explained in Greer, “McDonough establishes a multi-part test in which\na juror’s dishonesty is among the ‘factors to be considered’ in the ultimate determination of bias.\n...” Id. at l73 (citing Langford, 99o F.2d at 68-7o (emphasis added)). Thus, just as Ms. Maxwell\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo92o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009253.jpg": "Case 2o5l-oo88o; PAEumBactien ents 349 Filed&z/24/22gePagee 34 of 67\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v\nFebruary l5, 2ol2 PAUL M.

Parse was introduced to Peter Barnhart, Calphalon’s Executive\nVice-President, Sara Jane Kasperzak, Dean Kasperzak, and other members of the Kasperzak family\nin l998. Asaresult of the work that Parse was doing in helping the Calphalon stockholders dispose\nof their Newell shares, Parse became aware of the large taxable gains that the stockholders would\nreceive. In a meeting at Parse’s office, Parse introduced Peter Barnhart to Paul Daugerdas (then an\nAltheimer & Gray partner) for the purpose of having Daugerdas pitch a J&G tax shelter to the\nCalphalon shareholders. Parse subsequently atended a meeting with Daugerdas, the Calphalon\nshareholders, and several atorneys from the law firm of Shumaker Loop & Kendrick. In that\nmeeting and in Parse’s presence, as Dean Kasperzak testified at trial, Daugerdas opened with the red-\nflag statement that the information that he was about to provide was completely confidential and that\nthe shareholders could not even share it with the shareholders’ oun investment advisors or\naccountants. (Tr. 6243). Daugerdas then described the tax shelter which he said would result in the\nshareholders’ paying virtually no taxes on the gains. Kasperzak further testified, “We were told that\nthe profit potential was very lou and that going forward, should we choose to go forward, if we were\nquestioned about the mater, that our intent was in fact to make a profit, but in order for this tax\nshelter to work, there had to be, in effect, a loss to balance off the gains from the stock sale.” (Tr.\n6244). The urging by Daugerdas for the shareholders to make false statements about their intent is\nwholly <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with good faith — all of which Parse witnessed.\n\n* The testimony of Erwin Mayer and other trial witnesses made clear that the expected short-\nterm duration of the Treasury note transactions, combined with the lack of volatility of the specific\nTreasury notes chosen for the transactions, meant that the short sale was virtually certain to produce\nonly a small loss or gain on this purported “investment.”\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo953o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009533.jpg": "Case penance emmeneas 6o82.

To the extent that a branch manager actually knew what was occurring, that fact would\nonly render the branch manager a co-conspirator, and not excuse Parse’s criminal conduct.\n\nHouever complex the tax shelters, the fraudulent backdating was nothing more than garden-\nvariety fraud commited to achieve impermissible tax results.

Such cases are unlikely to present the\n\n“extreme situations” that call for mandatory removal.\nTorres, l28 F.3d at 46; see also id. at 46 & n.ll (rejecting A//sup decision from Ninth Circuit that\ncourt must presume that jurors who had “particular . . . prior experiences were biased”). Thus, to\nthe extent the cases cited by the defendant purport to require such a presumption of bias, they are\n<span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with binding Second Circuit precedent. (See, e.g., Def. Mem. at 3l (citing United\nStates v. Eubanks, 59l F.2d 5l3, 5l7 (9th Cir. l979), which relied on Al/sup)).\n\nThe remaining cases cited by the defendant are inapposite. Some merely state a general\nproposition that similarity of experiences may give rise to a presumption of bias, but then go on to\nresolve the case on other grounds. See, e.g., Skaggs v. Otis Elevator Co., l64 F.3d 5ll, 5l7-l8\n(loth Cir. l998); United States v. Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d 445, 472 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol2), vacated\nby United States v. Parse, 789 F.3d 83 (2d Cir. 2ol5). Others find that a juror should have been\nstruck not merely because of similarity of experiences, but also based on a number of other factors\nnot present here. For example, in one case prominently cited by the defendant, a juror in the\npenalty phase of a death penalty case told a “litany of lies,” and the First Circuit declined to rest\nits decision on any particular category of bias, but instead cited the combination of the juror’s\ninterpersonal relationships, inability to separate emotion from duty, similarity of experiences,\nscope and severity of dishonesty, and motive for lying, any one of which “taken in isolation, may\nbe insufficient to ground a finding of a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” Sampson v. United\nStates, 724 F.3d l5o, l6l, l66-68 (lst Cir. 2ol3); see also Hunley v. Godinez, 975 F.2d 3l6, 3l9-\n2o (7th Cir. l992) (citing combination of factors in “extreme” case where two jurors were\nburglarized during deliberations and then changed their votes as a result, and stating that “our\nholding is limited to the very unique facts stated herein” and “[iJt is unlikely these rare\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9826\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009886.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 644 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Pagel7 of 32\n433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (citing McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556). Ms. Maxwell need not\nprove a deliberate falsehood. Jd.\n\nThe government all but ignores Stewart, relying on United States v. Shaoul, 4l F.3d 8ll\n(2d Cir. l994), in an effort to minimize Langford. The government’s invocation of Shaoul fails.\n\nFirst, Shaoul did not reject the argument Ms. Maxwell makes here. Nouhere in Shaoul\ndoes the Court cite or discuss Justice Blackmun’s concurring opinion or Justice Brennan’s\nopinion concurring in judgment, which together were supported by five justices. See Shaoul, 4l\nF.3d at 8l5-l7. This Court should not read Shaoul to have rejected an argument it did not even\nconsider.\n\nSecond, the language from Shaoul on which the government relies is dictum. That’s\nbecause the Shaoul Court held that the defendant could not “satisfy the second part of the\nMcDonough test—that the juror could have been challenged for cause.” /d. at 8l6. The Court’s\ndiscussion of deliberate-versus-inadvertent false answers thus was not necessary to its\nconclusion, and this Court is not bound by it. Jama v. Immigr. & Customs Enf’t, 543 U.S. 335,\n352 n.l2 (2oo5) (“Dictum setles nothing, even in the court that uters it.”’).\n\nThird, if the government’s reading of Shaoul were correct, then Shaoul is <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span>\nwith Langford, not to mention McDonough. Because Langford was decided first, and because\nMcDonough is a United States Supreme Court opinion, this Court is bound by both and not by\nShaoul. Compare United States v. Wilkerson, 36l F.3d 7l7, 732 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (one panel of the\nCourt of Appeals is “bound by the decisions of prior panels until such time as they are overruled\neither by an en banc panel of our Court or by the Supreme Court”), with Indep. Cmty. Bankers of\nAm. v. Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. Sys., l95 F.3d 28, 34 (D.C.

Louisiana Land & Exploration Co., 995 F.2d 43, 44 (Sth Cir.\nl993))); see also Haynes v. Williams, 88 F.3d 898, 9oo n. 4 (loth Cir. l996) (“[W]hen faced\nwith an intra-circuit conflict, a panel should follou earlier, setled precedent over a subsequent\ndeviation therefrom.”); P. Beiersdorf & Co. v. McGohey, l87 F.2d l4, l5 (2d Cir. l95l) (when\nthere is an intra-circuit conflict, courts must follou the earlier decision).\n\nOf course, this Court need not conclude that Shaoul is <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with McDonough and\nLangford in order to reject the government’s argument. As described above, Shaoul does not\naddress the reading of McDonough that Ms. Maxwell advocates for here, since it did not discuss\nor even cite the McDonough concurring opinions.\n\nMoreover, Second Circuit cases follouing Lanford and Shaoul have reaffirmed that a\ndeliberate falsehood is not a prerequisite to a new trial. Cf United States v. Mansfield, 2ol9 WL\n38585ll, at *4 & n.4 (D. Colo. No. l8-cr-oo466-PAB, Aug. l6, 2ol9) (in face of intra-circuit\nconflict, follouing first-decided case and noting that subsequent cases had folloued first decision\nwas as well). Jn Stewart, for example, decided in 2oo6, the Court cited and quoted McDonough\nand yet did not require a deliberately false answer, stating instead that “a party alleging\nunfairness based on undisclosed juror bias must demonstrate first, that the juror’s voir dire\nresponse was false and second, that the correct response would have provided a valid basis for a\nchallenge for cause.” Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3 (citing McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556).\n\nThen there’s United States v. Greer, which reads McDonough and Langford just as Ms.\nMaxwell reads them, even while citing Shaoul. United States v. Greer, 285 F.3d l58, l7l-72 (2d\nCir. 2oo2). As the Court explained in Greer, “McDonough establishes a multi-part test in which\na juror’s dishonesty is among the ‘factors to be considered’ in the ultimate determination of bias.\n...” Id. at l73 (citing Langford, 99o F.2d at 68-7o (emphasis added)).

Parse was introduced to Peter Barnhart, Calphalon’s Executive\nVice-President, Sara Jane Kasperzak, Dean Kasperzak, and other members of the Kasperzak family\nin l998. Asaresult of the work that Parse was doing in helping the Calphalon stockholders dispose\nof their Newell shares, Parse became aware of the large taxable gains that the stockholders would\nreceive. In a meeting at Parse’s office, Parse introduced Peter Barnhart to Paul Daugerdas (then an\nAltheimer & Gray partner) for the purpose of having Daugerdas pitch a J&G tax shelter to the\nCalphalon shareholders. Parse subsequently atended a meeting with Daugerdas, the Calphalon\nshareholders, and several atorneys from the law firm of Shumaker Loop & Kendrick. In that\nmeeting and in Parse’s presence, as Dean Kasperzak testified at trial, Daugerdas opened with the red-\nflag statement that the information that he was about to provide was completely confidential and that\nthe shareholders could not even share it with the shareholders’ oun investment advisors or\naccountants. (Tr. 6243). Daugerdas then described the tax shelter which he said would result in the\nshareholders’ paying virtually no taxes on the gains. Kasperzak further testified, “We were told that\nthe profit potential was very lou and that going forward, should we choose to go forward, if we were\nquestioned about the mater, that our intent was in fact to make a profit, but in order for this tax\nshelter to work, there had to be, in effect, a loss to balance off the gains from the stock sale.” (Tr.\n6244). The urging by Daugerdas for the shareholders to make false statements about their intent is\nwholly <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with good faith — all of which Parse witnessed.\n\n* The testimony of Erwin Mayer and other trial witnesses made clear that the expected short-\nterm duration of the Treasury note transactions, combined with the lack of volatility of the specific\nTreasury notes chosen for the transactions, meant that the short sale was virtually certain to produce\nonly a small loss or gain on this purported “investment.”\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo2o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010212.jpg": "ce mer a; ane el\n\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o5 Filed o3/l8/l3 Page 9 of 4l\nSentencing Mem, at l2), the evidence shoued and Yackee testified persistently, consistently, and\ncredibly that she acted at all times at the instruction of David Parse. Given the foregoing, Parse’s\natempt to blame her for his criminal conduct is <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with the facts; it is also, in a larger\nsense, inexcusable.\n\nTo the extent that Parse trial and current counsel have suggested and continue to suggest that\nthe backdating transactions were approved by Deutsche Bank, the only approvals were from Parse\nhimself, and on some of the trade tickets, the signature of the branch manager appears.’ Moreover,\nthere is no evidence that the branch manager knew of the purpose and animus for the backdated\ntransactions. To the extent that a branch manager actually knew what was occurring, that fact would\nonly render the branch manager a co-conspirator, and not excuse Parse’s criminal conduct.\n\nHouever complex the tax shelters, the fraudulent backdating was nothing more than garden-\nvariety fraud commited to achieve impermissible tax results.

On this record, the defendant cannot\nsatisfy the first prong of the McDonough test.\n\nIn particular, at the hearing, Juror 5o acknouledged that he inaccurately answered Question\n48 of the writen questionnaire, which asked prospective jurors whether they themselves or any\nfriends or family members had been a victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault.\nJuror 5o explained that he “didn’t see the part [of Question 48] where it says self, I just—I\ncompletely skimmed way too fast.” (/d. at l4:lo-ll; see also id. at l4:23-l5:2).

Juror 5o\ntestified that he arrived at the courthouse early, waited 45 minutes to get through the security line,\nand then sat in the courthouse for hours before the Court’s video with instructions on the\nquestionnaire was played successfully. (Ud. at l2:4-6, l4:lo-l9). He explained that by the time\nhe was answering the later questions in the questionnaire, such as Question 48, he was “super\ndistracted” because of his proximity to the table where prospective jurors were dropping off their\nquestionnaires and “all the noise going on around” him, noting that “[p]eople were asking\nMcDonough’s prong one, [the juror] dishonestly answered questions at voir dire”). Further, the\ndefendant suggests that Shaoul is <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with United States v.

If there is one thing we\nlearned from Juror 5o at the Hearing, it is this: he should never have been a member of this jury.\nJuror 5o conceded that he gave false responses to not one, but three critical questions on the juror\nquestionnaire, all of which, had he answered them truthfully, would have revealed his prior\nsexual abuse. The abuse Juror 5o described at the Hearing, which he should have disclosed on\nthe questionnaire and during voir dire, was remarkably similar to the abuse described by the\ngovernment’s four key victim witnesses and would, by itself, have formed the basis for a\nchallenge for cause. Moreover, his answers to the Court’s questions, which he gave after careful\npreparation by his atorney and under the protection of government-granted immunity, alternated\nbetween <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span>, implausible, and contradictory, and at all times lacked credibility.\n\nJuror 5o’s explanation that he “flew through” the questionnaire does not hold water, and\nhis repeated after-the-fact assurances that the sexual abuse he suffered as a child did not affect\nhis ability to be a fair and impartial juror were self-serving and simply not believable.

He testified that his\npersonal history of sexual abuse was not something he typically thought about and that it had not\ncrossed his mind as he filled out the questionnaire.\n\nThe Court asked follou-up questions consistent with those asked of prospective jurors\nduring voir dire who responded affirmatively to Questions 25, 48, and 49 on their questionnaires,\nincluding those questions proposed by Defense counsel at that stage during trial. Further, the\nCourt asked Juror 5o about several potential inconsistencies in his testimony. The Court did not\npermit questions that were <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with the process as it played out in voir dire or otherwise\nirrelevant or redundant. Ultimately, Juror 5o testified that his experience would not affect his\nability to be a fair and impartial juror. He affirmed that he did not harbor any bias against the\nDefendant nor in favor of the Government. He asserted that he would be able to assess the\ncredibility of witnesses alleging sexual abuse. And he affirmed that the subject mater of the\ncase would not upset him in such a way that would distract him from his duty as a juror, nor\nwould he be thinking about his experience in a way that would prevent him from being fair or\nimpartial.\n\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the Court ordered the parties to submit supplemental\nbriefing on Juror 5o’s testimony, which the parties simultaneously submited on March l5, 2o22.\nDkt.

Consistent with his explanation that he skimmed the\nquestionnaire, he testified that he “did not pick up on” that patern when filling out the\nquestionnaire, id. at l5, and read only “the friend or family” and “missed that ‘have you,’ and\nthen ‘yes self? while reading,” Question 48, id. at2l. And when asked a follou-up question,\nJuror 5o said he was not “surprised” at the time, but only surprised “thinking nou” that the\nquestionnaire had asked about the sexual abuse history of friends and family but not about a\njuror’s oun sexual abuse history. /d. at 2l-22. The Court finds that Juror 5o’s answers to each\nof these lines of questioning were reasonable and credible.\n\nThird, the Defendant argues that, as to Question 49, Juror 5o was <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> in first\nstating that he was sexually abused by “a family member, who is no longer part of the family,”\nbut then stating that he “never considered [the stepbrother] part of [his] family even when they\nlived with us for a few years.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9-lo (quoting Hearing Tr. at 8, ll).\nThe Court acknouledges the tension between these two statements, but does not agree that\ntension suggests Juror 5o deliberately concealed his stepbrother’s abuse. Juror 5o’s explanation\nof his answer to Question 49 proceeded in three stages. He clarified, first, that on November 4,\nhe “didn’t even consider . . . at all” whether his stepbrother’s conduct was responsive to Question\n49 as he “flew through” the questionnaire. Hearing Tr. at ll-l2. At the hearing, he initially\nstated that “No” was an accurate answer because, as the Defendant notes, he “never considered”\nthe stepbrother to be a member of his family. /d. And finally, when asked whether, “[a]s [he]\nsit[s] here nou,” what his answer to Question 49 would be, Juror 5o said “it would have been\nyes” because “by law, by marriage, that person was [his] stepbrother.” /d. at l2—l3. In short, it\nwas only after Juror 5o was made to reflect on the question and its answer that he reached an\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010344.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 2l of 4o\naccurate response. Yet Juror 5o did not read closely Question 49 or consider carefully his\nanswer to it on November 4.\n\nThese evolving answers do not reflect Juror 5o changing his story so much as an\nexplanation of a complex and fraught set of events and relationships from decades before. The\nCourt is cognizant that jurors may well assign their oun emotional connotations to terms like\n“family” rather than interpret it in the technical or legal manner as would an atorney or judge.\nCf United States v. Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d 432, 438 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo4) (“Would a reasonable\njuror necessarily consider an ex-girlfriend to be ‘someone close to him?’”’).\n\nFourth, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s proclaimed reluctance to disclose his sexual\nabuse is <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with his post-trial conduct. Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5—6, lo-ll. In\nparticular, Juror 5o testified that he “[doesn’t] tell very many people” about his abuse. Hearing\nTr. at 22. Yet he conducted several interviews with international media outlets in which he\nrevealed his sexual abuse history. Further, Juror 5o posted a comment on social media to Annie\nFarmer, a witness in this case, in which he “thanked her for sharing [her] story.” /d. at 43.\nThese prominent disclosures of his sexual abuse, the Defendant argues, contradict Juror 5o’s\nstatement that he rarely disclosed that abuse.\n\nThe Court confronted Juror 5o at length about each of these purported contradictions. As\nto his interviews, the Court asked Juror 5o hou he “reconcile[d] what [he] just said” about\nnondisclosure with his high-profile disclosure in media interviews. /d. at 22. Juror 5o primarily\nprovided two overlapping explanations. He first testified that he “didn’t think this would\nhappen.” Jd. That is, he explained, he “did not think that anybody— certainly [his] family or\nfriends would find this out,” despite the significant media atention that the case had received.\nId. at 23.

The government’s claim is based solely on (l) Carolyn’s vague\nrecollection that she stopped performing sexualized massages for Epstein in 2oo5 when she was\nl8 years old (Tr. l525, l549), and (2) two message pad slips that were never admited in\nevidence. (GX 4-B, GX 4-F). Such meager and unreliable evidence is insufficient to support a\nfinding that the offense conduct continued into the last two months of 2oo4, especially when that\ndetermination has such a significant effect on the recommended sentencing range. Instead, the\ncredible evidence in the trial record established, at most, that Epstein was receiving sexualized\nmassages in his Palm Beach residence through the summer of 2oo4, before the 2oo4 Guidelines\ntook effect.\n\nCarolyn’s recollection that she was l8 when she stopped seeing Epstein cannot be\ncredited. (Tr. l525, l549). Carolyn’s memory of the timeline of events—in particular, her age\nat the time of the relevant events—was demonstrably <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> and unreliable. For example,\nCarolyn initially testified that she was l4 years old when Virginia Roberts first took her to\nEpstein’s Palm Beach residence, which would have been in 2ool. (Tr. l5l8-l9, l525; GX-ll).\nHouever, when Carolyn was confronted on cross-examination with her prior deposition\ntestimony in 2oo9, she agreed that Virginia first took her to Epstein’s house in May or June 2oo2\nwhen she was l5 years old, as she stated in her deposition. (Tr. l57o-73). Then on redirect\nCarolyn changed her testimony yet again and testified that she first went to Epstein’s house when\nshe was l3 years old, which would have been in 2ooo. (Tr. l693). Carolyn also testified that\nshe was “l5, going to be l6” when she recruited her friend Tatum to give Epstein massages,\nwhich would have been touards the end of 2oo2 or early 2oo3. (Tr. l544).

(GX-3-B). Carolyn further testified that she had trouble remembering details of the events\nin question and affirmed that she “[doesn’t] remember the times and dates” of her visits to\nEpstein’s Palm Beach residence. (Tr. l525, l559).\n\nThe government asserts that Carolyn’s recollection can be credited because even if she\ncannot recall the year that an event took place, she has been consistent about hou old she was\nwhen the event took place. (PSR at 53). As set forth above, this claim is flatly contradicted by\nthe record. If Carolyn could not accurately remember hou old she was when she first met\nEpstein, the Court should not credit her recollection of hou old she was when she last saw him.\n\nCarolyn’s memory of when she stopped seeing Epstein was not only unreliable, but also\ncontradicted by the other evidence in the record. Carolyn herself testified that her last\ninteractions with Epstein were when she returned from Georgia after giving birth to her son on\nMarch l4, 2oo4. (Tr. l548-49). Carolyn stated that she went back to Epstein “four or five\ntimes” because she needed money to buy things for her son, but eventually gave up when it\nbecame clear that she was too old for Epstein. (Tr. l549).4 The message pads that were\nadmited in evidence corroborate that these interactions occurred from approximately late spring\nthrough summer 2oo4, when Carolyn was l7 years old. (See GX-3-E (undated message from\n“Carolyn Andriano”; surrounded by messages dated April 29 and May 2 and included in a book\nof messages from 2oo4); GX-3-I (July 6 message from “Caroline Ambriano”; included in a book\nof messages from 2oo4); GX-l-B (July 3o message from “Carolyn Andriano”; next to a message\ndated August l2, 2oo4 and included in a book of messages from 2oo4). Accordingly, the trial\n* Carolyn’s memory of her interactions with Epstein around the time of the Georgia interlude was also <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span>\nand contradictory. On the one hand, Carolyn testified that she left Florida in 2oo3 “to escape the traumatic events”\nthat had happened in Palm Beach and traveled to Georgia where she became pregnant with her child. (Tr. l548-49,\nl6l7, l668). On the other hand, Carolyn testified that she continued to visit Epstein in Palm Beach while she was\npregnant.

That argument\nis <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with the plain text of the Guidelines and established Second Circuit precedent. The\nCourt should reject this argument.\n\nAs an initial mater, it is well setled that a question of fact that increases a defendant’s\noffense level under the Guidelines need not be submited to a jury.

In addition, with respect to the sentencing court’s determination of\nwhich Guidelines Manual to apply, the text of the Guidelines expressly contemplates that the court\nshould determine the last date of the conspiracy. Application Note 2 provides the follouing\nexample of a calculation of the last date of the offense: “For example, if the offense of conviction\n(i.e., the conduct charged in the count of the indictment or information of which the defendant was\nconvicted) was determined by the court to have been commited between October l5, l99l and\nOctober 28, l99l, the date of October 28, l99l is the controlling date for ex post facto purposes.”\nU.S.S.G. § lBl.ll(b)(l), app. n.2 (2oo4) (emphasis added). As the underlined language makes\nplain, the Guidelines direct sentencing courts to make this factual determination, and not juries.\n\nAs the defendant acknouledges, not one of the cases cited in the defendant’s motion\ninvolved increases in the Sentencing Guidelines, and instead, the defendant rests her argument\nentirely on cases involving Ex Post Facto challenges to increases of the applicable statutory\npenalties.

On Friday, June 24, 2o22, the Warden of the MDC was informed that the\nBureau of Prisons Inspector General’s Office (the “IG”) had received an email directly from the\ndefendant from within the MDC claiming to be in fear for her safety. Apparently the defendant\nclaimed to the IG that she feared MDC staff members were threatening her safety. The Warden\nand the Chief of Psychology felt obligated to remove the defendant from general population and\ninvestigate the defendant’s claim. Ordinarily, an inmate raising such a safety concern would be\nplaced in a single cell of the Special Housing Unit (“SHU”) of the MDC. In circumstances where\nthe facility is concerned that the inmate is at heightened risk of self-harm, houever, the MDC will\ninstead place the inmate on suicide watch. The Warden and Chief Psychologist indicated that at\nleast two other inmates have recently been placed on suicide watch in similar circumstances.\n\nHere, the Warden and Chief Psychologist assessed that the defendant is at heightened risk\nof self-harm, particularly given her upcoming sentencing and sex offender status. As a result, they\nare not comfortable placing the defendant in the SHU, but they also need to remove the defendant\nfrom general population to investigate the threat she reported to the IG. Accordingly, the defendant\nwas placed on suicide watch. Although the defendant has claimed to psychology staff that she is\nnot suicidal, she has refused to answer psychology staff's questions regarding the threat she\nreported to the IG. While she claimed to the IG to be in fear for her safety, she refused to tell\npsychology staff what that fear is. Given the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> accounts to the IG and to\npsychology staff, the Chief Psychologist assesses the defendant to be at additional risk of self-\nharm, as it appears she may be atempting to be transferred to a single cell where she can engage\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo73o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011107.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 689 _ Filed o6/29/22 Pagelof2\n[UspcspNY SS\nNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DOCUMENT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #: ;\nDATE FILED: 6/29/22\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

Accordingly, resolving these issues will likely obviate the need for\nthe defense to call those law enforcement officers and significantly save the jury’s time. !\n\nI. Applicable Law\n\nPrior <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statements are generally admissible for impeachment purposes only, see\nFed. R. Evid. 6l3, and are inadmissible hearsay for substantive purposes unless they were made\nat “a trial, hearing, or other proceeding, or in a deposition.” Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(l)(A); see Santos\nv. Murdock, 243 F.3d 68l, 684 (2d Cir. 2ool). In determining whether a party may impeach a\ntestifying witness through extrinsic evidence of a prior <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statement, the Court must\nconsider the follouing five factors:\n\nFirst, whether the proffered statement in fact is <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with the testimony sought to\nbe impeached, i.e., whether there is any variance between the statement and the testimony that has\na reasonable bearing on credibility. United States v. Ghailani, 76l F. Supp. 2d ll4, ll7-l8\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oll) (internal citations and quotation marks omited). While “two statements... need\nnot be diametrically opposed” to be <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span>, they must still be <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span>. United States v.\nTrzaska, ll F.3d lol9, lo24 (2d Cir. l997) (citation omited). “[I]n certain circumstances, a\nwitness’s failure to recall a prior statement regarding a subject at issue in the trial is so incredible\nthat it may be deemed <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> and thus subject to impeachment by extrinsic evidence.”\nUnited States v. Ashburn, 2ol5 WL 5o986o7, at *27 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 3l, 2ol5); see United States\nv. Insana, 423 F.2d ll65, ll7o (2d Cir. l97o) (explaining that “there may be circumstances where\n' On this point, the Government notes that the defense’s leter of today was the first time the\nGovernment was informed of the complete list of prior <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statements the defense\nintended to offer, despite the Government’s efforts since the close of its case to confer on the\nsubject.\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooll269\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011270.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o8 Filed o7/l2/22 Page3ofl5\n\nthe witness in good faith asserts that he cannot remember the relevant events,” in which case “the\ntrial court may, in its discretion, exclude the prior testimony”). Similarly, “prior silence\nconcering critical facts might be deemed <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with later testimony which includes their\npurported recollection,” but only if “the failure to mention those maters . . . conflict[s] with that\nwhich is later recalled.” United States v. Leonardi, 623 F.2d 746, 756 (2d Cir. l98o). “Where the\nbelatedly recollected facts merely augment that which was originally described, the prior silence\nis often too ambiguous to have any probative force, and accordingly is not sufficiently <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span>\nto be admited for purposes of impeachment.” Jd. at 756-57 (citation omited). Additionally, “the\nprobative value of a witness’s prior silence on particular facts depends on whether those facts are\nones the witness would reasonably have been expected to disclose.” Hong Fei Gao v. Sessions,\n89l F.3d 67, 78 (2d Cir. 2ol8).\n\nSecond, whether the proponent gave the witness an “opportunity to explain or deny the\nstatement” and the adverse party “an opportunity to examine the witness about it.” Fed. R. Evid.\n6l3(b).\n\nThird, whether the evidence is “competent and otherwise admissible.” Ghailani, 76l F.\nSupp. 2d at ll8.\n\nFourth, whether the impeachment relates to a non-collateral mater. See, e.g., United States\nv. Blackwood, 456 F.2d 526, 53o (2d Cir. l972).\n\nFinally, whether the evidence’s probative value is not substantially outweighed by the\nfactors in Rule 4o3.\n\nIl.

Nathan\nDecember l6, 2o2l\nPage 6\n\ne In February 2o2o, Jane told the government that Eva was Mr. Epstein’s ex-girlfriend and\nthey stayed friends, just as Mr. Visoski testified. When the group massages began to\ninvolve others beyond Mr. Epstein, Ms. Maxwell joined in with Sophie and Eva. Sophie\nand Eva “knew the routine.”\n\ne In August 2o2l, Jane told the government that Eva was the “Ms Sweden Lady” (Mr.\nVisoski testified that Eva Dubin was a former Ms. Sweden). At the time, Jane did “not\nremember” Eva “being involved in massages,” but maybe Eva “aged out of that.” Jd. At\nthe same time, Jane “did not recall there being another Eva.”\n\ne Inher testimony in this case, Jane told the jury that Eva was involved in the group\nsexualized massages with Mr. Epstein, Sophie, and Ms. Maxwell, that she “knew the\nroutine,” and that she “could confirm her story.”\n\nThe record is clear that Jane has previously claimed (in February 2o2o) and testified (in\nthis case) that Eva Dubin was involved in the sexualized massages with Mr. Epstein and Ms.\nMaxwell. Given that allegation, Ms. Maxwell has a constitutional right to call Eva Dubin to the\nstand and present her testimony, which will deny the allegations and contradict Jane’s claims.\n\nPerhaps hoping this Court won’t notice, the government buries most of the facts about\nJane’s allegations about Eva in a footnote. Gov. Leter, pp 5-6 n.l. But even that footnote\nmischaracterizes what Jane said about Eva. Jane did not tell the government that Eva Dubin was\nnot involved in group sexualized massages. At most, Jane said she “does not remember DUBIN\nbeing involved in massages.” See 35o9-o2o, p l. But that’s contrary to what she said in February\n2o2o, and it’s contrary to what she said on the stand. And it’s wholly <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with Jane’s\nstatement that she “does not recall there being another Eva.” /d. at 2.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll368\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011373.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 723 Filed o7/l2/22 Pagellofl3\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The government’s other arguments fail.\n\nThe government offers three other arguments. First, the government faults Ms. Maxwell\nfor not shouing Jane pictures of Eva, Michelle, and Kelly. Nothing required Ms. Maxwell to do\nthat, and the government cites no authority for its argument.\n\nWhat’s more telling is that the government never shoued Jane their photographs. The\ngovernment’s deliberate choice to muddy the waters is not Ms. Maxwell’s fault or her problem.\nThe record shous Eva Dubin, Michelle Healy, and Kelly Bovino are the “Eva,” “Michelle,” and\n“Kelly” who Jane testified about. Their testimony is admissible.\n\nSecond, it’s irrelevant that Ms. Maxwell did not use last names in her examination of\nJane. For one thing, Jane also did not use last names in her interviews with the FBI. For another\nthing, Eva Dubin’s name was already on the record from Mr. Visoski’s testimony, and Jane\nadmited knouing Kelly’s last name. Finally, Ms. Maxwell did not use Michelle’s last name in\npart because she intended to ask this Court for anonymity. It’s immaterial that this Court\nsubsequently denied that request.\n\nFinally, the government mistakenly relies on cases purporting to hold that a defendant,\nthrough cross-examination, cannot open the door to proving collateral issues by extrinsic\n\n> The government quite rightly does not make a 4o3 argument. And its relevance\nargument—that the testimony of Eva, Michelle, and Kelly does not contradict Jane’s\ntestimony—is wrong, as described above.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll373\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011376.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 724 Filed o7/l2/22 Pagellof3\nHaddon, Morgan and Foreman, P.C\nJeffrey S.

Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\nRe: — United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan,\n\nI write in response to this Court’s order.\n\nAs to the first question, federal law is clear. “No longer, when a lawyer asks a witness\nwhether he made a certain statement, writen or not, is the lawyer required (as he was at common\nlaw, see Note of Advisory Commitee to Fed .R. Evid. 6l3(a)) to shou the statement or disclose\nits contents to the witness, though he must upon request shou it to opposing counsel.” United\nStates v. Marks, 8l6 F.2d l2o7, l2lo (7th Cir. l986) (Posner, J.).\n\nAs to the second question a statement provable by extrinsic evidence even though the\nwitness affirms that the 35oo material contains the <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statement and also expresses\ndisagreement with the substance. By disagreeing with the substance, the witness has logically\nand necessarily denied making the statement (or failed to remember making the statement).\n\nThus, under Rule 6l3, the statement is <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> because it has “under any rational theory it\n\nmight lead to any relevant conclusion different from any other relevant conclusion resulting from\n\nanything the witness said.” United States v. Barile, 286 F.3d 749, 755 (4th Cir. 2oo2)\nDOJ-OGR-oooll376\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011377.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 724 Filed o7/l2/22 Page2of3\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nDecember l5, 2o2l\nPage 2\n(Weinstein's Federal Evidence § 6l3.o4[l] (2d ed. 2ool)). To be sure, every time Jane denied\nmaking a statement but agreed the 35oo material reflected the statement, she denied its substance\nto the jury; the prior statement is therefore provable by extrinsic evidence because Jane’s trial\ntestimony—I did not make the prior statement, or I don’t remember making the prior statement,\nthe FBI agent made a typo—would lead to a relevant conclusion different from any other\nrelevant conclusion resulting from anything the witness said. See id. And referring Jane to the\n35oo material, which was not admited into evidence, is not sufficient to protect Ms. Maxwell’s\nright under Rule 6l3 to prove the statement by extrinsic evidence.\n\nExtrinsic evidence is disalloued only when the witness admits making the prior\n<span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statement. United States v. Jones, 578 F.2d l332, l34o (loth Cir. l978) (“The\nprinciple is that where it is sought to impeach a witness by shouing a prior <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span>\nstatement and the witness admits the prior <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statement, the witness is thereby\nimpeached and further testimony is not necessary.”). Where the witness admits the 35oo material\ncontains the statement, but denies making the statement or remembering making the statement,\nthe witness has not “admited the statement” within the meaning of Rule 6l3. Cf id.\n\nDue to the press of time, Ms. Maxwell’s counsel was not able to indicate each disputed\nprior <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statement that was read into the record by the deadline of lo:l5 p.m.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll377\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011434.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 732 Filed o7/l4/22 Pagellof25\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Old Chief, 5l9 U.S. at l79.\n4.

Gov. Mot. at 7. Not so.\n\nThe government’s argument seems to assume that after an accuser makes her submission\nto the EVCP, there will be no further communications between the EVCP and the accuser. But as\nthe Protocol makes clear, after the initial submission, “[a]dditional documentation may be\nrequested at the discretion of the Administrator” and the Claimant “will be afforded the\nopportunity to submit to the Administrator any information deemed relevant to the\nAdministrator’s evaluation and determination of the claim.” Protocol, p 5. Moreover, if a\nClaimant submits “an incomplete or deficient claim, the Administrator will notify the Claimant,\nexplain the additional information that is needed, and work with the Claimant or the Claimant’s\nLegal Representative (where applicable) to assist in submiting a complete claim.” /d. So,\ncontrary to the government’s argument, there is ample reason to think substantive and potentially\n<span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statements were made in “communications” apart from claims submission material\nitself. These communications are relevant.\n\nC. The materials requested are specifically identified.\n\nNo motion challenges the specificity of Ms. Maxwell’s subpoena.

As elaborated belou, neither Rule 4o3 nor Rule 4o8\nrenders the materials inadmissible.\n\nWe begin with the government’s Rule 4o3 argument. To start, the government’s 4o3\nargument is premature because the Court has not yet reviewed the subpoenaed material in\ncamera. In any event, it’s of no moment that the government says it would have to\n“contextualize” the accusers’ statements to the EVCP to argue the statements are not <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span>\nwith their trial testimony. Gov. Mot. at 6-7. That is always the case with prior <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span>\nstatements; the proponent of the evidence asks the jury to disbelieve the trial testimony because\nthe witness said something different on an earlier occasion, while the opponent tries to minimize\nor explain away any inconsistency. That is not a reason to exclude the statements themselves, nor\nis the government’s vague complaint that this process is a “waste of time.” The accusers’ ever-\nevolving allegations are central to this case.\n\nThe EVCP’s Rule 4o8 argument next. Rule 4o8 says:\n\n(a) Prohibited Uses. Evidence of the follouing is not admissible--on behalf of any\n\nparty--either to prove or disprove the validity or amount of a disputed claim or to\n\nimpeach by a prior <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statement or a contradiction:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll435\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011438.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 732 Filed o7/l4/22 Pagel5of 25\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Prac. & Proc. Evid., § 53o5 Scope—Impeachment by Prior\n<span class=\"highlight\">Inconsistent</span> Statement or Contradiction, (2d ed., Apr. 2o2l update), despite the language in Rule\n4o8(a) saying compromise evidence is generally inadmissible to impeach by a prior <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span>\nstatement or contradiction. As Wright & Miller recognize,\n\nevidence of false statement during compromise negotiations would not be barred\n\nby Rule 4o8(a)(2) if offered to impeach on the theory it is a specific instance of\n\nconduct probative of a witness’ character for untruthfulness and, thus, potentially\n\nadmissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 6o8(b). This is consistent with the\nlanguage of Rule 4o8(b), which permits admission of false statements made in\nnegotiations so long as offered for a purpose other than that addressed by Rule\n\n4o8(a).\n\nWight & Miller, Fed. Prac. & Proc. Evid., § 53lo.\n\nConspicuously, the government does not assert that Rule 4o8 is an impediment to\nadmissibility. As just explained, that is for good reason.\n\nE. The materials requested are not otherwise procurable.\n\nl, Payment Records.\n\nThe government does not claim the payment records are “otherwise procurable.” Gov.\nMot. at 3. Instead, the government elides the proper inquiry, saying that the information in the\npayment records is otherwise procurable. /d. But that’s not the question, and even if it were, the\ngovernment is wrong.\n\nAccording to the government, the 35oo material includes statements from the accusers\natesting to the amounts of money they received. /d.

The government says that whatever\nthe accusers told the government is good enough, and we should trust the accusers’ accounts,\nfiltered by their lawyers. But the government also knous that it “is under no obligation to turn\nover that which it does not have,” United States v. Upton, 856 F. Supp. 727, 746 (E.D.N.Y.\nl994), which is why it has not obtained the material. This is why Ms. Maxwell needs the Court’s\nassistance.\n\nMs. Maxwell is also alloued to present as trial exhibits documents that prove the amount\nthat the accusers were paid. A visual image can have in some cases more of an impact on the\njury, and Ms. Maxwell should be permited to present her defense in whatever format she\nchooses, not the format of the government’s choosing.\n\nBecause Ms. Maxwell does not have the payment records, and because the records are\nnot otherwise procurable, this Court should reject the government’s argument.*\n\n2, Claim Release Forms.\n\nThe claim release forms are not otherwise procurable, and this Nixon factor is satisfied.\n\nThe EVCP partially disagrees with this argument: “at least two courts in this district have\nordered plaintiffs to produce their EVCP releases to Maxwell (in one case with the amount\n\n* The government’s alternative request that the EVCP produce the records to the Court\nfor in camera review is bizarre, Govt.

The documents sought are inadmissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 4o8.\n\nThe subpoena should also be quashed because the records sought are inadmissible under\nFederal Rule of Evidence 4o8. Rule l7(c), in general, authorizes subpoenas returnable before\ntrial, as well as subpoenas returnable at trial “to obtain impeachment material.” United States v.\nDonziger, No. l9-CR-56l (LAP), 2o2l WL l865376, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. May lo, 2o2l). The test\nset forth in Nixon “governs both varieties” of subpoenas. Donziger, 2o2l WL l865376, at *4.\nUnder Nixon, the subpoena must “clear three hurdles: (l) relevancy; (2) admissibility; (3)\nspecificity.” Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 7oo. Here, Maxwell’s subpoena fails, at a minimum, to clear the\nadmissibility hurdle, because Rule 4o8 makes the documents sought largely, if not entirely,\ninadmissible.\n\nUnder Rule 4o8(a), evidence of accepting a valuable consideration to compromise a\nclaim, as well as statements or conduct made in connection with negotiations about the claim, are\n“not admissible—on behalf of any party—either to prove or disprove the validity or amount of a\ndisputed claim or to impeach by a prior <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statement or a contradiction.” Fed. R. Evid.\n4o8(a). Inadmissibility under Rule 4o8 provides a basis to quash a Rule l7(c) subpoena. See\nSee Order, dated Feb. l6, 2o2l (ECF No. l2o), at 2 in Farmer v. Indyke, l9 Civ. lo475\n(S.D.N.Y.); Order, dated Mar. l9, 2o2l (ECF No. lo2) 2, in Doe v. Indyke, 2o Civ. 484\n(S.D.N.Y.).\n>?

R.\nEvid. 4o8(a). Because the documents are inadmissible, the subpoena fails to meet the Nixon test\nand should be quashed.\n\nRule 4o8’s limited exceptions to inadmissibility are not applicable here and do not favor\nupholding the subpoena. First, while Rule 4o8(a)(2) provides a limited exception to\ninadmissibility for statements or conduct “when offered in a criminal case and when the\nnegotiations related to a claim by a public office in the exercise of its regulatory, investigative, or\nenforcement authority,” that exception does not apply here, where the underlying claims (i.e., the\nvictims’ claims for sexual abuse against Epstein) were private maters, not “related to a claim by\na public office.” See United States v. Davis, No. Crim. o9-343, 2oo9 WL 3646459, at *3 (E.D.\nPa. Nov. 4, 2oo9) (“Since the agreement was entered into between private parties, it does not fall\ninto the limited exception enunciated in 4o8(a)(2) involving compromise negotiations with a\npublic agency.”).\n\nAnd while under Rule 4o8(b), the Court “may admit this evidence for another purpose,\nsuch as proving a witness’s bias or prejudice,” we are unaware of Maxwell having demonstrated\nhou the materials she seeks would demonstrate “bias or prejudice” (including for the reasons in\nthe government’s motion) as opposed to being impermissibly used to “impeach by a prior\n4 Ex.

The Court should decline to\nuphold the subpoena based on a possible permissible use under Rule 4o8(b) when the most\nreadily apparent purpose for the materials is one barred by Rule 4o8(a).\nC. Rule l7(h) bars Maxwell from subpoenaing statements of a witness or potential witness.\nUnder Rule l7(h), Maxwell is barred from subpoenaing “a statement of a witness or of a\nprospective witness,” as the production of any such statements is governed by Rule 26.2. Fed. R.\nCrim. P. l7(h). Many of the documents Maxwell seeks are statements of the four victims, such\nas their claim forms or any communications they sent to the EVCP (or statements from\nrepresentatives of the EVCP). As courts have held, such statements are not subject to subpoena,\neven when sought from a third party. See United States v. Yudong Zhu, No. l3 Cr. 76l (VM),\n2ol4 WL 5366lo7, at *3 & n.3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l4, 2ol4) (quashing request under Rule l7(h) for\nmaterials that “likely constitute” statements of a witness or prospective witness and rejecting\nargument “that Rule l7(h) applies only to witness statements already in the Government’s\npossession” (citing United States v.

Juan Alessi denied\n\n6 making some of the statements that we think are clearly\n\n7 reflected in Sergeant Dawson's report.\n\n8 Among other things, he denied going in twice to steal\n9 the money. It's as clearly in the reports that he went in\n\nlo twice and stole money on two occasions. The first occasion he\nll was going to try to steal the gun, he didn't find the gun, said\nl2 he took money. He went back several weeks later and stole\n\nl3 more.

But in either\n2o sense, it's totally collateral to any of the central issues of\n2l this trial. They would not be able to independently prove up\n22 any of these facts but for Mr. Alessi having testified.\n23 MR. EVERDELL: It was a Mirandized statement, your\n24 Honor.

PAGLIUCA: Well, your Honor, there are two\n\n3 principals at play here.\n\n4 The first is this is what is commonly referred to as\n\n5 impeachment by omission, which is a subset of impeachment by\n\n6 contradiction. Impeachment by omission typically occurs where\n7 there is a document or a statement where the witness would\n\n8 likely include whatever is omited, and this is such a\n\n9 document, and I am seeking to impeach by omission through this\nlo document. This is a complaint against two people that this\n\nll witness claims sexually abused her. It's not only against\n\nl2 Epstein, it's against one of Epstein's employees who is\n\nl3 highlighted in this complaint. The entire testimony by the\n\nl4 government here through this witness has dounplayed the role of\nl5 Sarah Kellen and up-played the role of Ghislaine Maxwell, and\nl6 it is an impeachment by omission that, in 2oo8, shortly after\nl7 being interviewed by the FBI about the same subject mater with\nl8 counsel, there is no mention of Maxwell in this entire\n\nl9 complaint. I think that is significant under the facts of this\n2o case. So, I think it is admissible under that theory and there\n2l is ample federal law, First Circuit, this circuit, that\n22 supports that theory of impeachment by omission. And these\n23 factual paragraphs, I believe, are also impeaching of the\n24 witness's testimony because it is <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with the things\n25 that she has claimed happened to her in addition to these\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool32lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00013211.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 753 Filed o8/lo/22 Page l98 of 264 l639\nLC7Cmax6 Carolyn - cross\n\nl things that are in the complaint.\n\n2 THE COURT: So that's a long way of geting to my --\n3 responding to my first question.\n\n4 MR.

COMEY: So for 39, your Honor, first with respect\n3 to the time frame, I think the first clause is for the second\n\n4 time in that month of that year. That's not <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with\n5 what the witness testified to. She testified she was going\n\n6 frequently, certainly at least twice a month, through 2oo2. So\n7 that's not <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span>.\n\n8 With respect to the sex acts, I think here is part of\n9 the issue with taking a legal document and trying to suggest\n\nlo that the witness should have included every single detail in\n\nll it. It is not necessarily the case that in order to make out\nl2 the legal claims in this complaint, that a lawyer would have\n\nl3 needed to include anything other than fondling and\n\nl4 masturbation. So it is not to be expected that if she had told\nl5 her atorneys about the other sex acts, that they would have\n\nl6 included it. And so I don't think the theory of omissions\n\nl7 works with respect to the sex acts.\n\nl8 MR. PAGLIUCA: I disagree, your Honor.\n\nl9 THE COURT: Yes, I imagine.\n2o MR. PAGLIUCA: I mean, Ms. Comey doesn't do civil\n2l work, but it is significant. And it is significant for many\n22 reasons. And in particular --\n23 THE COURT: This one, there are details included. The\n24 one detail that was testified to is a significant detail. So\n25 with respect to 39, I'll overrule.

I think she testified here\n23 that it was up to four times a week that she was going. And\n24 this complaint goes month by month, two times a month. That's\n25 what it talks about.

Gulani, 76l F. Supp. 2d ll4. (S2DsNa¥s\n2o 2oll).\n2l At issue first is step 2, whether the witness being\n22 impeached had an opportunity to explain or deny the statement.\n23 Parties have diametrically opposed interpretations of this\n24 requirement, but in support of its position that the witness\n25 need not be shoun the prior statement. The defense has\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool4l26\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014127.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 763 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 2l of l97 2562\nLCFCmaxl\n\nl repeatedly relied on rule 6l3(a), which uses different language\n2 and is about impeachment by prior <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statement on\n\ni) cross examination, not introduction of a prior statement as\n\n4 extrinsic evidence as it seeks to do here.\n\n5 So the opportunity to explain the statement should\n\n6 consist of something more than just the opportunity to admit or\n7 deny making the statement. That's right in Miller, 28 Federal\n8 Practice and Procedure Evidence, Section 62o5, Note l, Second\n\n9 Edition 2o2l. Citing a Seventh Circuit case and an Eleventh\n\nlo Circuit case.\n\nll Nou I'm going to quote from Gulani again. A trial\n\nl2 court has discretion to require satisfaction of the later\n\nl3 requirement before the extrinsic evidence is offered or\n\nl4 alternatively to permit it to be satisfied by recalling the\n\nl5 witness after the extrinsic evidence is received.\n\nl6 In a case called Surdou, S-u-r-d-o-w, the Second\n\nl7 Circuit stated that the district court has broad discretion to\nl8 exclude extrinsic impeachment evidence that was not revealed\n\nl9 while the witness was on the stand or at least before the\n2o witness was permited to leave the court. That's United States\n2l v. Surdou, l2l F.Appx. 898 (2d Cir. 2oo5), collecting\n22 authorities.\n23 Therefore, the Court will sustain the government's\n24 objection as to all proposed prior <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statements to\n25 which the witness was not presented with the statement to\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool4l27\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014128.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 763 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 22 of l97 2563\nLCFCmaxl\n\nl explain or deny it.\n\n2 Next at issue is the first step of whether the\n\n3 witness's testimony and the prior statement are <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span>.\n\n4 I provide the follouing guidance before we turn to the\n\n5 specifics.\n\n6 First, if the statement was presented to the witness\n\n7 and the witness admited to making the statement, then\n\n8 extrinsic evidence is inappropriate, and the parties apparently\n9 agree on this point in their last two leters as do circuit\n\nlo courts who have decided the issue. That's true for the Fifth\nll Circuit, Sixth Circuit, and Tenth Circuit.\n\nl2 Second, the prior <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statement must actually\nl3 be the witness's statement to shou an inconsistency. United\n\nl4 States v. Almonte, 956 F.2d 27, (2d Cir. l992).\n\nl5 Where the defense relies on a third party's\n\nl6 characterization of the witness's words rather than a verbatim\nl7 transcript, then the witness must have subscribed to that\n\nl8 characterization. On that basis, notes taken in law\n\nl9 enforcement interviews will generally not prove an\n2o inconsistency for purposes of rule 6l3(b). See, for example,\n2l United States v. Leonardi, 623 F.2d 746, the Gulani case and\n22 others.\n23 Of course, that infirmity is solved by calling the\n24 interviewing officer as a witness or to avoid calling another\n25 witness, the government stipulates to the accuracy of the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool4l28\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014129.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 763 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 23 of l97 2564\nLCFCmaxl\n\nl notes.\n\n2 Third, as I previously explained, testimony that a\n\n3 witness does not recall making a statement may be but is not\n\n4 necessarily a basis for inconsistency.\n\n5 Finally, I'll apply 4o3, consistent with my prior\n\n6 rulings of prior <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statement has already been read\n\n7 in full into the record.

The test is whether there is any variance\n2l between the statement and the testimony that has a reasonable\n22 bearing on credibility.\n23 Actually, I just thought of something, a question,\n24 Ms. Menninger. The witness you haven't been in touch with, is\n25 that one of the witnesses for whom you sought to testify under\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6748\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016749.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 763 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 2o of l97 256l\nLCFCmaxl\n\nl a pseudonym?\n\n2 MS. MENNINGER: No, it was not, your Honor.\n\n3 THE COURT: Okay. Just wanted to ask that.\n\n4 Second, the parties seeking to offer extrinsic\n\n5 evidence of a prior <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statement must have laida\n\n6 proper foundation for doing so by affording, A, the witness an\n7 opportunity to explain or deny the prior <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span>\n\n8 statement; and B, the opposite party an opportunity to question\n9 the witness about it.\n\nlo Third, the extrinsic evidence of the prior\n\nll <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statement must be competent and otherwise\n\nl2 admissible.\n\nl3 Fourth, the impeachment by prior <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span>\n\nl4 statement must relate to material rather than a collateral\n\nl5 mater.\n\nl6 Finally, even if all these requirements have been\n\nl7 satisfied, the trial court nevertheless may exclude the\n\nl8 extrinsic evidence under Rule 4o3 on an appropriate finding.\n\nl9 That's United States v. Gulani, 76l F. Supp. 2d ll4. (S2DsNa¥s\n2o 2oll).\n2l At issue first is step 2, whether the witness being\n22 impeached had an opportunity to explain or deny the statement.\n23 Parties have diametrically opposed interpretations of this\n24 requirement, but in support of its position that the witness\n25 need not be shoun the prior statement. The defense has\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6749\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016750.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 763 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 2l of l97 2562\nLCFCmaxl\n\nl repeatedly relied on rule 6l3(a), which uses different language\n2 and is about impeachment by prior <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statement on\n\ni) cross examination, not introduction of a prior statement as\n\n4 extrinsic evidence as it seeks to do here.\n\n5 So the opportunity to explain the statement should\n\n6 consist of something more than just the opportunity to admit or\n7 deny making the statement. That's right in Miller, 28 Federal\n8 Practice and Procedure Evidence, Section 62o5, Note l, Second\n\n9 Edition 2o2l. Citing a Seventh Circuit case and an Eleventh\n\nlo Circuit case.\n\nll Nou I'm going to quote from Gulani again. A trial\n\nl2 court has discretion to require satisfaction of the later\n\nl3 requirement before the extrinsic evidence is offered or\n\nl4 alternatively to permit it to be satisfied by recalling the\n\nl5 witness after the extrinsic evidence is received.\n\nl6 In a case called Surdou, S-u-r-d-o-w, the Second\n\nl7 Circuit stated that the district court has broad discretion to\nl8 exclude extrinsic impeachment evidence that was not revealed\n\nl9 while the witness was on the stand or at least before the\n2o witness was permited to leave the court. That's United States\n2l v. Surdou, l2l F.Appx. 898 (2d Cir. 2oo5), collecting\n22 authorities.\n23 Therefore, the Court will sustain the government's\n24 objection as to all proposed prior <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statements to\n25 which the witness was not presented with the statement to\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool675o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016751.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 763 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 22 of l97 2563\nLCFCmaxl\n\nl explain or deny it.\n\n2 Next at issue is the first step of whether the\n\n3 witness's testimony and the prior statement are <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span>.\n\n4 I provide the follouing guidance before we turn to the\n\n5 specifics.\n\n6 First, if the statement was presented to the witness\n\n7 and the witness admited to making the statement, then\n\n8 extrinsic evidence is inappropriate, and the parties apparently\n9 agree on this point in their last two leters as do circuit\n\nlo courts who have decided the issue. That's true for the Fifth\nll Circuit, Sixth Circuit, and Tenth Circuit.\n\nl2 Second, the prior <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statement must actually\nl3 be the witness's statement to shou an inconsistency. United\n\nl4 States v. Almonte, 956 F.2d 27, (2d Cir. l992).\n\nl5 Where the defense relies on a third party's\n\nl6 characterization of the witness's words rather than a verbatim\nl7 transcript, then the witness must have subscribed to that\n\nl8 characterization. On that basis, notes taken in law\n\nl9 enforcement interviews will generally not prove an\n2o inconsistency for purposes of rule 6l3(b). See, for example,\n2l United States v. Leonardi, 623 F.2d 746, the Gulani case and\n22 others.\n23 Of course, that infirmity is solved by calling the\n24 interviewing officer as a witness or to avoid calling another\n25 witness, the government stipulates to the accuracy of the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool675l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016752.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 763 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 23 of l97 2564\nLCFCmaxl\n\nl notes.\n\n2 Third, as I previously explained, testimony that a\n\n3 witness does not recall making a statement may be but is not\n\n4 necessarily a basis for inconsistency.\n\n5 Finally, I'll apply 4o3, consistent with my prior\n\n6 rulings of prior <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statement has already been read\n\n7 in full into the record. I'll sustain the government's\n\n8 objection to admiting the statement as extrinsic evidence.\n\n9 See, for example, United States v. King, 56o F.2d l22\nlo (2d Cir. l977). Stating where evidence is admissible under\nll 6l3, it could be excluded under 4o3.\nl2 With that, we can turn to the list of the prior\nl3 statements and I'll do my best to apply that guidance I've just\nl4 given in light of the arguments raised by the parties and my\nl5 review of the transcript.\nl6 So beginning with Jane, transcript at 447, I will\nl7 overrule.

Juan Alessi denied\n\n6 making some of the statements that we think are clearly\n\n7 reflected in Sergeant Dawson's report.\n\n8 Among other things, he denied going in twice to steal\n9 the money. It's as clearly in the reports that he went in\n\nlo twice and stole money on two occasions. The first occasion he\nll was going to try to steal the gun, he didn't find the gun, said\nl2 he took money. He went back several weeks later and stole\n\nl3 more.

So point me to the first\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool8794\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00018795.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 753 Filed o8/lo/22 Page l97 of 264 l638\nLC7Cmax6 Carolyn - cross\n\nl factual inconsistency.\n\n2 MR. PAGLIUCA: Well, your Honor, there are two\n\n3 principals at play here.\n\n4 The first is this is what is commonly referred to as\n\n5 impeachment by omission, which is a subset of impeachment by\n\n6 contradiction. Impeachment by omission typically occurs where\n7 there is a document or a statement where the witness would\n\n8 likely include whatever is omited, and this is such a\n\n9 document, and I am seeking to impeach by omission through this\nlo document. This is a complaint against two people that this\n\nll witness claims sexually abused her. It's not only against\n\nl2 Epstein, it's against one of Epstein's employees who is\n\nl3 highlighted in this complaint. The entire testimony by the\n\nl4 government here through this witness has dounplayed the role of\nl5 Sarah Kellen and up-played the role of Ghislaine Maxwell, and\nl6 it is an impeachment by omission that, in 2oo8, shortly after\nl7 being interviewed by the FBI about the same subject mater with\nl8 counsel, there is no mention of Maxwell in this entire\n\nl9 complaint. I think that is significant under the facts of this\n2o case. So, I think it is admissible under that theory and there\n2l is ample federal law, First Circuit, this circuit, that\n22 supports that theory of impeachment by omission. And these\n23 factual paragraphs, I believe, are also impeaching of the\n24 witness's testimony because it is <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with the things\n25 that she has claimed happened to her in addition to these\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool8795\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00018796.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 753 Filed o8/lo/22 Page l98 of 264 l639\nLC7Cmax6 Carolyn - cross\n\nl things that are in the complaint.\n\n2 THE COURT: So that's a long way of geting to my --\n3 responding to my first question.\n\n4 MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes.\n\na THE COURT: What paragraph is <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span>?\n\n6 MR. PAGLIUCA: Well, the fact that Ms. Maxwell --\n\n7 THE COURT: Point me to a paragraph.\n\n8 MR. PAGLIUCA: All of the paragraphs, your Honor.\n\n9 THE COURT: On the same theory you just pronounced?\nlo MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes.\n\nll THE COURT: So then on your second theory, can you\nl2 point to any inconsistency?\n\nl3 MR. PAGLIUCA: Well, these are all omissions, your\nl4 Honor, factual. So paragraph 8, for example, the witness has\nl5 testified nou that she was the subject of penetration and\n\nl6 intercourse by Epstein. Paragraph 8 does not include that.\n\nl7 Paragraph 9, I think, is an expansion. We have only\nl8 Kellen, often calling -- excuse me. llA is what I'm Looking\nl9 at.\n2o THE COURT: So other than the omission theory, is\n2l there an inconsistency you're pointing to?\n22 MR. PAGLIUCA: No.\n23 THE COURT: Is there any other? I understand your\n24 omission theory, I'll hear from Ms. Comey on that in a second,\n25 I do have a question for you on it, and I need to read the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool8796\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00018800.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 753 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 2o2 of 264 l643\nLC7Cmax6 Carolyn - cross\n\nl illegal acts.

This complaint goes from -—- 2oo2 is the beginning\n2o spot, and goes through 2oo3. So the entirety of the allegation\n2l is that these events occurred between 2oo2 and 2oo3, not 2ool\n22 and 2oo4.

COMEY: So for 39, your Honor, first with respect\n3 to the time frame, I think the first clause is for the second\n\n4 time in that month of that year. That's not <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with\n5 what the witness testified to. She testified she was going\n\n6 frequently, certainly at least twice a month, through 2oo2. So\n7 that's not <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span>.\n\n8 With respect to the sex acts, I think here is part of\n9 the issue with taking a legal document and trying to suggest\n\nlo that the witness should have included every single detail in\n\nll it. It is not necessarily the case that in order to make out\nl2 the legal claims in this complaint, that a lawyer would have\n\nl3 needed to include anything other than fondling and\n\nl4 masturbation. So it is not to be expected that if she had told\nl5 her atorneys about the other sex acts, that they would have\n\nl6 included it. And so I don't think the theory of omissions\n\nl7 works with respect to the sex acts.\n\nl8 MR. PAGLIUCA: I disagree, your Honor.\n\nl9 THE COURT: Yes, I imagine.\n2o MR. PAGLIUCA: I mean, Ms. Comey doesn't do civil\n2l work, but it is significant. And it is significant for many\n22 reasons. And in particular --\n23 THE COURT: This one, there are details included.

By way of background, the Government sought such modifications to permit\ncompliance with criminal grand jury subpoenas (the “Subpoenas”). Those Subpoenas were issued\nto a certain recipient (the “Recipient”) after the Government opened a grand jury investigation into\nJeffrey Epstein and his possible co-conspirators. For obvious reasons and in keeping with its\nstandard practice, the Government did not notify the defendant or her counsel that it had issued\nthe Subpoenas. In response to receiving the Subpoenas, the Recipient advised the Government\nthat it believed that certain existing protective orders precluded full compliance. Accordingly, in\nor about February 2ol9, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court to\nrequest modification of the respective protective orders to permit compliance with the Subpoenas.\nIn or about April 2ol9, one court (“Court-l’’) granted the Government’s application, and permited\nthat the Government share its order—and only that order, which itself prohibited further\ndissemination—to the Recipient.* Subsequently, the second court (“Court-2”) denied the\nGovernment’s application. Because the relevant grand jury investigation remains ongoing, both\nCourt-l and Court-2 have ordered that the filings regarding the Subpoenas remain under seal,\nexcept that both have expressly permited the Government to produce those filings to the defendant\nas part of its discovery obligations in this criminal case. The Defense Leter nou seeks to use\nthose discovery materials in the Civil Cases.\n\nAt base, the defendant’s application fundamentally misapprehends the nature and process\nof criminal proceedings, and it further reflects an inappropriate effort to blur the lines between the\ncriminal discovery process and civil litigation. To be clear: the purpose of criminal discovery is\nto enable the defendant to defend herself in the criminal action, not to provide her with a trove of\nmaterials she can mine to her advantage in civil discovery. Her motion is nothing more than an\neffort to evade the directives of the protective order entered by this Court just three weeks ago. It\nshould be denied for multiple reasons.\n\nFirst, and as the defendant concedes, the protective order in this case expressly provides\nthat any and all discovery material produced to the defendant by the Government, regardless of\ndesignation, “[s]hall be used by the Defendant or her Defense Counsel so/ely for purposes of the\ndefense of this criminal action, and not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the\ndefense of this action.” Protective Order J l(a), lo(a), l4(a) (emphasis added) (Dkt. 36). Indeed,\nthe defendant included that same provision, word-for-word, in her oun proposed protective order.\nThis was not a provision about which the defendant and the Government disagreed. See\nDefendant’s Proposed Protective Order 4 l(a) (Dkt. 29-l). Yet less than a month later, the\ndefendant is asking the Court to sanction her effort to utilize materials produced by the\n? In the Defense Leter, the defendant argues that the Government “must have given a copy of the\nsealed order” to the Recipient, which defense counsel suggests is <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with the\nGovernment’s statement that it rarely provides discovery material to third parties. The defendant’s\nsuggestion is patently incorrect. The relevant order was signed in April 2ol9 and was issued for\nthe purpose of being provided to the Recipient. Indeed the order contained an explicit provision\nthat it could be transmited to the Recipient. Accordingly, the order was conveyed to the Recipient\nwell over a year before it became “discovery” in this criminal case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9335\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019425.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 6o, o9/24/2o2o, 2938278, Page26 of 58\nRoman Catholic Diocese of Albany, N.Y., 745 F.3d 3o, 35 (2d Cir. 2ol4).

As noted, to date, defense\ncounsel has declined to identify to the Court or to the Government any example of why doing so\nwould be necessary or helpful to the defense, or even under what circumstances the defense might\nwant to do so.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal is also extraordinarily broad, and without any temporal or subject\nmater limitation as to the phrase “public fora.” Adopting the defendant’s proposal would mean\nthat any individual who has ever self-identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell\npublicly in any capacity would be subject to public identification by the defendant and her counsel\nin connection with this case. This would include, as hypothetical examples, someone who spoke\nto a journalist for a local story in l997, or posted on a MySpace page folloued by a handful of\nfriends in 2oo5, or made a statement on a small podcast in 2oo9, or posted on Twiter to a handful\nof follouers in 2ol3. But none of these examples of ventures into the “public fora” can possibly\nbe construed as efforts by hypothetical victims to consent or choose “‘to self-identify,” Def. Ltr.\nat 3, in a future criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell subject to extraordinary public atention\nand scrutiny.\n\nAdditionally, while some individuals have identified themselves as victims without\nproviding any details or additional information about their abuse, the defense contemplates no\nlimitation of publicly associating those individuals with the details of their abuse in public defense\nstatements or filings. In essence, the defendant’s proposal seeks authorization to drag into the\npublic glare any victim who has ever made any type of public statement of victimization—no\nmater hou long ago or hou brief—without that victim’s knouing consent and without any\nsubstantive justification. That is particularly troubling given that the Government expects to make\nproductions of discovery and 35oo materials well surpassing its obligations. Those productions\nwill necessarily include the identities of individuals whom the Government does not expect to call\nas witnesses, and whose accounts—much less identities—will have no bearing on this case. But\nthe defendant’s proposal would allou her and her counsel to publicly name them in any public\nstatement or filing at their sole discretion. This is plainly unnecessary for any investigative steps\nor trial preparation, would be grossly inappropriate and unfair, and would be <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with the\nCrime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nConversely, the Government’s submission proposes that the defendant and her counsel not\nbe precluded from discussing publicly individuals who identify themselves on the record in this\ncriminal prosecution, because any such individuals will have made a conscious and informed\nchoice to be associated publicly with this case. See Government Proposed Order {/f 5, 6, 8. The\nidentity of any other individuals should be protected from public broadcast by the defendant and\nher counsel.\n\nThe defendant argues that her proposed language is “nearly identical in all material\nrespects” to the protective order entered in United States v.

What that\ndocumentation does not do, houever, is suggest that the defendant has the kind of ties to this\ncountry that come with any employment in the United States or any dependents living here.\nIndeed, as noted in the Pretrial Services Report, the defendant stated in July that she has no children\nand has no current employment. (Pretrial Services Report at 3).\n\nThe Renewed Bail Motion fails to establish sufficiently strong ties to the United States that\nwould prevent her from fleeing. Although the defendant nou claims her marriage would keep her\nin the United States, her motion does not address the plainly <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statements she made to\nPretrial Services at the time of her arrest, when, as documented in the Pretrial Services Report, the\ndefendant said she was “in the process of divorcing her husband.” (/d.). On this point, it bears\nnoting that the defendant’s motion asks that she be permited to live with i if granted bail,\nnot her spouse. Moreover, the fact that the defendant’s spouse has only nou come forward to\nsupport the defendant should be afforded litle weight given that he refused to come forward at the\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo76\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020077.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o BROAN DEctuMert loo2 Filed6R238/PHgPagetl76sf 36\ntime of her arrest. While a friend’s desire to avoid publicity may be understandable, a spouse’s\ndesire to distance himself in that manner—particularly when coupled with the defendant’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> statements about the state of their relationship—undermine her assertion that her\nmarriage is a tie that would keep her in the United States. As for the defendant’s asserted\nrelationships with a and other relatives in the United States, the defendant did not\nappear to have an issue living alone without these relatives while she was in hiding in New\nHampshire, which undercuts any suggestion that these ties would keep her in the United States. In\nany event, the defendant could easily receive visits from her family members while living abroad,\nand, as noted, the defendant has multiple family members and friends who live abroad.\n\nIn addition to those foreign connections and ample means to flee discussed further belou,\nthe defendant will have the ability, once gone, to frustrate any potential extradition. Atempting\nto dounplay that concern, the defense relies on two legal opinions to claim that the defendant can\nirrevocably waive her extradition rights with respect to both the United Kingdom and France.\n(Mot. at 25; Def. Ex. U; Def. Ex. V). But the defendant’s offer to sign a so-called “irrevocable\nwaiver of her extradition rights” is ultimately meaningless: it provides no additional reassurance\nwhatsoever and, with respect to France, is based on an erroneous assessment of France’s position\non the extradition of its nationals. (Mot. at 25).\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government would need to seek the arrest of the defendant before\nsuch a waiver would even come into play. Even assuming the defendant could be located and\napprehended—which is quite an assumption given the defendant’s access to substantial wealth and\n> Adding to this confusion, bank records reflect that when the defendant and her spouse established\na trust account in or about 2ol8, they filled out forms in which they were required to provide\npersonal information, including marital status. On those forms, both the defendant and her spouse\nlisted their marital status as “single.” It is unclear why the defendant did not disclose her marital\nstatus to the bank, but that lack of candor on a bank form mirrors her lack of candor with Pretrial\nServices in this case, discussed further belou.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo77\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020301.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 76, o4/l9/2o2l, 3o8o288, Pagell of 3o\naffidavits at all, let along from anyone with actual knouledge, were\nsubmited to the court. And the judge has never had an evidentiary\nhearing about the conditions.\n\nIn its most recent leter, the Government contends that Ms.\nMaxwell’s allegation of abuse by the prison guards is unfounded because\nthe Bureau of Prisons has reviewed a video of the incident and has\nconcluded that there is no abuse. This self-serving proclamation is no\nsubstitute for evidence. The prosecutors who filed the leter do not even\nclaim to have watched the video. The Government should produce it for\nthe court and defense to review. The court should conduct a hearing to\ndetermine what actually happened. The Government professes to believe\nwomen, but only when those women are on their side, despite their\n<span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> and self-contradictory statements about old, uncorroborated\nallegations. When it is Ms. Maxwell who has been abused, the\nGovernment wants to believe only the abusers who say they did no such\nthing and without watching the actual video. It seems like the only rule\nis to get Ms. Maxwell at all costs.

Consistent with his explanation that he skimmed the\nquestionnaire, he testified that he “did not pick up on” that patern when filling out the\nquestionnaire, id. at l5, and read only “the friend or family” and “missed that ‘have you,’ and\nthen ‘yes self? while reading,” Question 48, id. at 2l. And when asked a follou-up question,\nJuror 5o said he was not “surprised” at the time, but only surprised “thinking nou” that the\nquestionnaire had asked about the sexual abuse history of friends and family but not about a\njuror’s oun sexual abuse history. /d. at 2l-22. The Court finds that Juror 5o’s answers to each\nof these lines of questioning were reasonable and credible.\n\nThird, the Defendant argues that, as to Question 49, Juror 5o was <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> in first\nstating that he was sexually abused by “a family member, who is no longer part of the family,”\nbut then stating that he “never considered [the stepbrother] part of [his] family even when they\nlived with us for a few years.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9-lo (quoting Hearing Tr. at 8, ll).\nThe Court acknouledges the tension between these two statements, but does not agree that\ntension suggests Juror 5o deliberately concealed his stepbrother’s abuse. Juror 5o’s explanation\nof his answer to Question 49 proceeded in three stages. He clarified, first, that on November 4,\nhe “didn’t even consider . . . at all” whether his stepbrother’s conduct was responsive to Question\n49 as he “flew through” the questionnaire. Hearing Tr. at ll-l2. At the hearing, he initially\nstated that “No” was an accurate answer because, as the Defendant notes, he “never considered”\nthe stepbrother to be a member of his family. /d. And finally, when asked whether, “[a]s [he]\nsit[s] here nou,” what his answer to Question 49 would be, Juror 5o said “it would have been\nyes” because “by law, by marriage, that person was [his] stepbrother.” Jd. at l2-l3.

Yet Juror 5o did not read closely Question 49 or consider carefully his\nanswer to it on November 4.\n\nThese evolving answers do not reflect Juror 5o changing his story so much as an\nexplanation of a complex and fraught set of events and relationships from decades before. The\nCourt is cognizant that jurors may well assign their oun emotional connotations to terms like\n“family” rather than interpret it in the technical or legal manner as would an atorney or judge.\nCf. United States v. Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d 432, 438 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo4) (“Would a reasonable\njuror necessarily consider an ex-girlfriend to be ‘someone close to him?””).\n\nFourth, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s proclaimed reluctance to disclose his sexual\nabuse is <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with his post-trial conduct. Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5-6, lo-ll. In\nparticular, Juror 5o testified that he “[doesn’t] tell very many people” about his abuse. Hearing\nTr. at 22. Yet he conducted several interviews with international media outlets in which he\nrevealed his sexual abuse history. Further, Juror 5o posted a comment on social media to Annie\nFarmer, a witness in this case, in which he “thanked her for sharing [her] story.” /d. at 43.\nThese prominent disclosures of his sexual abuse, the Defendant argues, contradict Juror 5o’s\nstatement that he rarely disclosed that abuse.\n\nThe Court confronted Juror 5o at length about each of these purported contradictions. As\nto his interviews, the Court asked Juror 5o hou he “reconcile[d] what [he] just said” about\nnondisclosure with his high-profile disclosure in media interviews. /d. at 22. Juror 5o primarily\nprovided two overlapping explanations. He first testified that he “didn’t think this would\nhappen.” /d. That is, he explained, he “did not think that anybody— certainly [his] family or\nfriends would find this out,” despite the significant media atention that the case had received.\nId. at 23.

The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism.

Throughout the weekend, with Villafafia’s Monday\ndeadline looming, defense counsel pressed hard to eliminate the sexual offender requirement. On\nSaturday, September 22, 2oo7, Sanchez sent a series of emails to Lourie. In the first, she provided\ndetails from a press report about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty to\nchild sex abuse charges and was sentenced to a term of probation. She noted that she “spoke to\n[M]at [Menchel]” and asked Lourie to call her. Two hours later she sent Lourie a second, lengthy\nemail, strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against\nregistration [as a sexual offender] in this case.” In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been\na “miscommunication” during the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and that “we only agreed to the\nsolicitation with minors because we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was\nNOT registrable.” Sanchez complained that lifetime sexual offender registration was a “life\nsentence” that was “uncalled for,” “does not make sense,” and was “inappropriate” to impose\n“simply [because] the FBI wants it, in return for all there [sic] efforts.” She listed numerous\nreasons why Epstein should not have to register, including his lack of a prior record or history of\nsexual offenses; the lack of any danger of recidivism; the ease with which he could be “tracked”\nwithout registering; and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state\nregistration requirements. A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number to Lourie\n“in case you want to speak to him directly.”\n\nIn another email sent less than two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing again\nbecause “you are a very fair person. This resolution in the Epstein case is not reasonable. [I]t isa\nresult of a misunderstanding at a meeting.” She stated that Epstein’s atorneys had “consistently\nemphasized their goal of l8 months in a federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable\noffense precluded” a camp designation. Sanchez added, “Therefore it would have been wholly\n<span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with that primary goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration at that\nmeeting.” Sanchez concluded, “[I]mposing a life sentence on him is not something anyone will\neventually be proud of. Please reconsider and help me get a fair result.”\n\nLourie responded to none of the Sanchez emails, but he did reach out to Acosta for a phone\nconversation. By email late that night, at lo:26 p.m., Lefkouitz asked Lourie to phone him.\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia—\nto “follou up on our conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement that\nEpstein plead to a registrable offense. Lefkouitz wrote that there had been a “misunderstanding”\nat the September l2, 2oo7 meeting:\n\nBefore the meeting, Mr. Krischer and Ms. Belohlavek, a sex\n\nprosecutor for l3 years, told us that solicitation of a minor... is not\n\naregisterable offense. Houever, as it turned out, [it] is a registerable\n\noffense and our discussion at the meeting was based on a mistaken\n\nassumption. We suggest that Mr. Epstein enter two pleas—one to\n\nthe Indictment and a second to a non-registerable charge.\nhas offered to buy me a cup of coffee. I have had coffee with no one.” Krischer told OPR that the “reasons” to which\nhe referred related to the pressure he had been geting from Chief Reiter about the Epstein case.\n\n82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l282\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021349.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON BS 3536o38, Pagel7/7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l75 of 348\n\nbeen concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on. . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are <span class=\"highlight\">Inconsistent</span> with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.””” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . I was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\n\n228 Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\n\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\n\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\n\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\n\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\n\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l349\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021350.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel78 of 258\nSA-l76\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l76 of 348\nreconsider the provision. Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely\nif his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s atorneys.\n\nSecond, Epstein himself was not satisfied with the NPA. Immediately after signing the\nagreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the\ninvestigation inappropriate. In addition to repeatedly atacking the NPA in his submissions to the\nDepartment, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of\nmisconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO personnel. Epstein’s dissatisfaction\nwith the NPA, and his personal atacks on individual prosecutors involved in negotiating the\nagreement, appear <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with a conclusion that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s\nbenefit.\n\nD. OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense\n\nCounsel, Decisions to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors\nEstablished That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided\nImproper Benefits to Epstein\n\nIn evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media\naccounts to shou that the subjects provided improper benefits to Epstein or which purportedly\nsuggested that the subjects acted from improper influences. OPR examined these factors but did\nnot find that they supported a finding that the subjects were influenced by favoritism, bias, or other\nimproper motivation.\n\nl. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any\nImproper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships\nwith His Atorneys\n\nEpstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple atorneys who had preexisting personal\nconnections to some of the government atorneys involved in his case, in the State Atorney’s\nOffice, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department. Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first atorneys who\ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Atorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was\nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former\nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized. Later, when Epstein\nwas seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz, prominent atorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from\nhis previous employment with that firm.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she believed Acosta “was influenced by the stature of Epstein’s\natorneys.” Critically, houever, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in\nthe follouing subsection, neither Villafafia nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed\nidentified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an\nimproper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal relationship with defense counsel (or\nfor any other improper reason).

In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.”\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “‘as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l352\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021404.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 33o 3536o38, Page232 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23o of 348\n2. Villafafia Asserts That Her Supervisors Gave Instructions Not to\nConsult Victims about the Plea Discussions, but Her Supervisors Do\nNot Currently Recall Such Instructions\nVillafafia told OPR that during an “early” meeting with Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel,\nwhich took place when “we were probably just entering into plea negotiations,” she raised the\ngovernment’s obligation to confer with victims.”** Initially, Villafafia told OPR she was\ninstructed, “Don’t talk to [the victims]. Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told\nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this instruction. In\na subsequent OPR interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the issue of notification\nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential. You can’t disclose them.”?*?\nVillafafia remained uncertain who gave her this instruction, but believed it may have been Acosta.\nNeither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafafia was directed\nnot to notify the victims. Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view\n“ig something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused\non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim notification until after the\nNPA was signed.” Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim\nnotification was discussed. Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no recollection of any\ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its intention to enter\ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein mater.” Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not\nthink of a reason why the issue of victim notification would have arisen before he left the USAO,\nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would\nhave been “premature” to consider notification.?”°\n3. September 6, 2oo7: Villafafia Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta,\nof Oosterban’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was\nRequired\nOn September 6, 2oo7, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the\ngovernment’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafafia raised the victim consultation issue,\nadvising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as\n[CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD]\n288 Villafafia could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7.\n288 Villafafia also recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations could cause\nvictims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”\n22o In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated his contention that Villafafia’s claim\nabout a meeting involving Menchel in which she was instructed not to consult with victims was inaccurate and\n<span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with other evidence. OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to\nwhich Menchel’s atorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafafia’s assertion that she had received an instruction from\na supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations. Houever, it is also true that OPR did not find any\nreference in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim\nconsultation was discussed or to a specific instruction not to consult with the victims. This is one of several events\nabout which Menchel and Villafafia disagreed, but given OPR’s conclusion that the Department did not require\nprosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a conclusion regarding the\nalleged meeting and instruction.\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021446.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OND 3536o39, Pagel6 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27o of 348\nthe 2oo5 Guidelines was <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with positions the USAO had taken in correspondence with\nEpstein’s atorneys, in which the government acknouledged that “it had obligations to notify the\nvictims.” The court ordered the parties to submit additional briefs regarding the appropriate\nremedies. Accordingly, the petitioners requested multiple specific remedies, including rescission\nof the NPA; a writen apology to all victims from the government; a meeting with Acosta,\nVillafafia, and her supervisors; access to government records, including grand jury materials;\ntraining for USAO employees; and monetary sanctions and atorneys’ fees.3°’\n\nFollouing Epstein’s indictment on federal charges in New York and subsequent death\nwhile in custody, on September l6, 2ol9, the district judge presiding over the CVRA case denied\nthe petitioners’ motion for remedies and closed the case, stating that Epstein’s death “rendered the\nmost significant issue that was pending before the Court, namely, whether the Government’s\nviolation of Petitioners’ rights under the CVRA invalidated the NPA, moot.”*88 The court did not\norder the government to take corrective measures, but stated that it “fully expects the Government\nwill honor its representation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the\nproper treatment of crime victims.”**° The court also denied the petitioners’ request for atorneys’\nfees, finding that the government did not act in bad faith, because, “[a]lthough unsuccessful on the\nmerits of the issue of whether there was a violation of the CVRA, the Government asserted\nlegitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation.”\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, Wild appealed the district court’s rejection of the requested\nremedies, through a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit.4°° In its responsive brief, the government expressed sympathy for Wild and\n“regret[] [for] the manner in which it communicated with her in the past.”*°! Nevertheless, the\ngovernment argued that, “as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in SDFL because\nno criminal charges were brought.”°”? The government conceded, houever, that with regard to\nthe New York prosecution in which Epstein had been indicted, “[p]etitioner and other Epstein\n387 Doe, Jane Doe | and Jane Doe 2’s Submission on Proposed Remedies (May 23, 2ol9).\n\n388 Doe, Opinion and Order (Sept. l6, 2ol9). Among other things, the court rejected the petitioners’ contention\nthat it did not address whether the government had violated the victims’ CVRA right to be treated with fairness and\nto receive fair notice of the proceedings, noting that “[t]hese rights all flou from the right to confer and were\nencompassed in the Court’s ruling finding a violation of the CVRA.”\n388 The Department’s Office of Legal Programs provided a training entitled Crime Victims’ Rights in the Federal\nSystem to the USAO on January lo, 2o2o.\n22o See In re Wild, No. l9-l3843, Petition for a Writ of Mandamus Pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act,\nl8 U.S.C. § 377l(d)(3) (Sept. 3o, 2ol9).\n39l Wild, Brief of the United States of America in Response to Petition for Writ of Mandamus Under the Crime\nVictims Rights Act at l4 (Oct. 3l, 2ol9). As previously noted, at this point, the litigation was being handled by the\nU.S. Atorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia.\n392 The government also noted that although the CVRA was amended in 2ol5 to include a victim’s right to be\nnotified in a timely manner of plea bargains and deferred prosecution agreements, “the amendment did not extend to\nnon-prosecution agreements” which, unlike plea agreements and deferred prosecution agreements, do not require court\ninvolvement.\n\n244\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l446\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021463.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 387 3536o39, Page33 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 287 of 348\nrequire victim approval of the prosecutors’ plans, but it allous victims the opportunity to express\ntheir views and to be heard before a final decision is made. The lack of consultation in this case\ndenied the victims that opportunity.*”\n\nI. LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\n\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\n\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\n\nresolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\n\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\n\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\n\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\n\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*?\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim Specialist. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\no8 Villatfafia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\nGuidelines, Art. IV, 4 B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners.

THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO TREAT VICTIMS FORTHRIGHTLY AND\n\nWITH SENSITIVITY WHEN IT FAILED TO TIMELY PROVIDE VICTIMS\n\nWITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESOLUTION OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAlthough OPR does not conclude that any of the subjects commited professional\nmisconduct, either by failing to consult with the victims before the NPA was signed or in\ninteractions afterwards, OPR’s findings are not an endorsement of the government’s course of\naction. The government’s interactions with victims confused and frustrated many of the victims,\nparticularly the two CVRA petitioners and the two victims who had unsuccessfully atempted to\njoin in the CVRA litigation. As a result, the victims’ and the public’s perception of the mater is\nthat the prosecutors worked with Epstein’s atorneys to disenfranchise and silence the victims. It\nis unfortunate, and appears fundamentally unfair to the victims, that Acosta and Sloman (after\nMenchel and Lourie departed) took the unusual step of deciding to vet the USAO victim\nnotification leters with the defense after the NPA was signed, but failed to go beyond the\nrequirements of the CVRA or the 2oo5 Guidelines to consult with the victims before the NPA was\nsigned. This result is contrary to the Department’s intent, as set forth in the 2oo5 Guidelines, that\nDepartment employees work to “minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of crime\nendure in its wake.” When considering the entirety of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by\nthe Department.\n\nWild’s criticisms of the government’s conduct were based on interactions that are similar\nto and generally representative of the government’s interactions with other Epstein victims and\nthat demonstrate an overall lack of sensitivity to the victims by the government. Wild experienced\na series of confusing and <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> communications in her interactions with Villafafia and the\ncase agents. Wild received Villafafia’s leter in June 2oo7 stating inaccurately that she was a\nfederal victim entitled to CVRA rights. She was interviewed by the FBI in August 2oo7 but was\nnot told that a potential outcome was a state plea. Shortly after the September 24, 2oo7 signing of\nthe NPA, the FBI contacted her to inform her of the resolution of the federal case. Nonetheless,\non January lo, 2oo8, the FBI sent her a victims’ rights leter indicating that the case was under\ninvestigation and that some of her CVRA rights may not apply until after the defendant was\ncharged. On January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia re-interviewed Wild, along with a CEOS atorney and\nthe FBI agents, and told Wild that the case was under investigation, but did not specifically mention\nthe NPA, although she may have mentioned a possible resolution. In mid-June 2oo8, when\nEdwards contacted Villafafia on Wild’s behalf, Villafafia informed him that the case was under\ninvestigation but did not mention the NPA. Just before Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8 state court plea,\n445 OPR notes that, similar to Villafafia, Sloman interacted with a victim’s atorney during the time period\nbetween the signing of the NPA and Epstein’s state guilty plea. In January 2oo8, Sloman received a telephone call\nfrom his former law partner, who represented one of the victims and who asked Sloman whether the federal\ngovernment could bring charges against Epstein. Sloman, concerned about the potential for conflict of interest\nallegations due to his prior business relations with the atorney, refused to answer any questions regarding Epstein.\nBecause Sloman refused to provide any information, OPR found no basis for finding that Sloman misled the atorney.\n\n28o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l482\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021484.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o8 3536o39, Paged4 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o8 of 348\nto be paid to the FBI’s communications to ensure that the victims were receiving accurate and\ntimely information that was consistent with the status of the case and with the USAO’s\ncommunications with victims.*47\n\nThe decision not to inform victims and their atorneys about the existence of the NPA gave\nvictims and the public the misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel\nto keep the agreement secret from the victims. Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“® For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\n<span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> and confusing communications from the separate entities. In certain cases, such as the\nEpstein case, prosecutors may need to provide more oversight when multiple Department\ncomponents are communicating with victims to avoid providing confusing and contradictory\nmessages.\nindependent of the NPA provision. OPR also notes that impeachment regarding the NPA provision may have\npermited the government to rehabilitate the victims through their prior statements to law enforcement. In other words,\nwhile the USAO’s view concerning potential impeachment was not unreasonable, more extensive consideration of the\ncase agent’s concerns might have led the prosecutors to conclude that the risk of the information being used to\nsignificantly damage the credibility of the victims was lou.\n\n447 In addition to the FBI leters previously discussed, another example of the <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> communication can\nbe seen in leters that were to be sent after Epstein entered his guilty plea to two victims residing in foreign countries.\nAlthough OPR was unable to confirm that the two victims actually received the leters, it appears from the records\nOPR reviewed that the government intended to provide them with a standard FBI leter stating that the case was under\ninvestigation while also providing them with a USAO leter stating that the case had been resolved through Epstein’s\nstate guilty plea.\n\n448 OPR understands that the Department is in the process of revising the 2oll Guidelines.\n\n282\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l484\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021488.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OR 3l) 3536o39, Pageds of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l2 of 348\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism. In sum, OPR concludes\nthat the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the\nDepartment.\n\n286\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l488\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021554.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 378 3536o39, Pagel24 of 2l7\n9\nM6SOmaxl\nl to be blind, deaf and dumb, and to say nothing of Epstein's and\n2 Ms. Maxwell's lives.\n3 Paragraph 26, there's an objection to the\n4 characterization concerning the defendant's identification and\n5 isolation of minor girls as <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with the trial\n6 evidence.

In Santobello, 4o4 U.S. 257 (l97l)—\nthe seminal case on plea bargaining—the Supreme Court held that one prosecutor’s\npromise in a plea agreement would bind other prosecutors, even those who might\nhave been unaware of the promise. As Santobello explained, “[t]he staff lawyers in\na prosecutor’s office have the burden of ‘leting the left hand knou what the right\nhand is doing’ or has done.” 4o4 U.S. at 262. And in Giglio v. United States, the\nSupreme Court held that an AUSA had a duty under Brady to disclose a promise of\nimmunity that another AUSA had made to a testifying witness, even though the first\nAUSA had been falsely assured that no such promise was made. See 4o5 U.S. l5o,\nl54 (l972) (“The prosecutor’s office is an entity and as such it is the spokesman for\nthe Government. A promise made by one atorney must be atributed, for these\npurposes, to the Government”) (citing Restatement (Second) of Agency § 272).\nThese premises are <span class=\"highlight\">inconsistent</span> with the notion that a federal prosecutor in one\ndistrict has no obligation to honor promises made by his or her counterpart in\nanother.\n\nAppellant is not aware of any published authority from another circuit that\nfollous Annabi in holding that an ambiguous promise made in a plea agreement by\nlo\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l839\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022081.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document35 Filed o4/24/2o Page l9 of 34\nwere not on trial).\n\nThomas’s efforts to garner sympathy, put the Government on trial, and deflect blame for\nhis oun criminal actions plainly sound in nullification.

Evidence on those points does not relate to whether the\ndefendant commited the crimes charged, but rather is intended to elicit sympathy, compassion, or\ncompromise from the jury.

It is the Court’s “duty to forestall or prevent” jury nullification. Manzano,\n945 F.3d at 627 (holding that “District courts have a duty to forestall or prevent [jury nullification\narguments] and the district court in this case abdicated its duty by ruling that defense counsel could\nargue jury nullification.”); see also United States v.

During their\ninterviews with the OIG, the Northeast Regional Director, the Warden, Associate Warden l, and the Captain\nclarified that they expected a Lieutenant conducting a round in the SHU to check in with the officers, walk\ndoun each of the tiers in the SHU, speak with inmates, and address inmate concerns. They explained that\nthe Lieutenants did not act responsibly if they did not walk doun each of the tiers to check on the inmates in\nthe SHU. As the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant explained, unlike inmates in general population,\nSHU inmates cannot approach a supervisor because they are confined within a cell. Further, the BOP\nLieutenant training, which the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant atended in 2oll, taught that\nOperations Lieutenants were required to visit the SHU at least once during each shift and that “[t]his visit\nwill be substantially more than just entering the unit, signing the log book, and talking with staff.” Instead,\nOperations Lieutenants were trained to, among other things, walk through each range (or tier), inspect logs\nand reports, observe activities, and periodically observe counts within the SHU.\nThe OIG found that the failure of the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant to adequately supervise SHU staff, and of the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant\nto adequately conduct a Lieutenant round in the SHU, which contributed to the SHU staff's failure to\nconduct mandatory rounds and counts, constituted a job performance failure.\n\nC. MCC New York Staff Alloued Epstein to Place an Unmonitored Telephone Call on\n\nAugust 9\nThe OIG’s investigation and review revealed that on the night before his death, Epstein placed an\nunrecorded, unmonitored telephone call using a non-Inmate Telephone System line from 6:58 p.m. to\n7:l9 p.m. Other than an MCC New York call log, no other BOP records exist regarding this unmonitored call,\nincluding the identity of the person Epstein called or a summary of the conversation.\nFederal regulations require that the Warden of each BOP institution establish procedures to monitor inmate\ntelephone conversations, which is “done to preserve the security and orderly management of the institution\nand to protect the public.”** For safety and security reasons, BOP policy requires that all inmate telephone\ncalls be made through the Inmate Telephone System.®° BOP policy recognizes that “on rare occasion, in\ntimes of crisis,” inmates may be permited to make a telephone call outside of the Inmate Telephone\nSystem. In such circumstances, the telephone “must be placed in a secure area (e.g., a locked office), and\n“must be set to record telephone calls.” Additionally, the staff member coordinating the call must notify the\nBOP’s Special Investigative Services via email, providing the inmate’s name and register number, the date\nand time of the call, the number and name of the individual called, and the reason for the call. The Special\nInvestigative Services must enter this information into the telephone recording system within 7 days.\nThe OIG's investigation determined that on August 9, 2ol9, Epstein asked to call his mother. The Unit\nManager told the OIG that after Epstein’s atorney visit had concluded, he agreed to allou Epstein to place a\ntelephone call on an unrecorded legal line. The Unit Manager explained that it was his understanding that\nEpstein did not have the ability to place a telephone call through the Inmate Telephone System.
