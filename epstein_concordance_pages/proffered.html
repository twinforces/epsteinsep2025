All this in less than a week, and all in addition to an Indictment that\nalready alleges the existence of dozens of victims in New York and dozens of victims in Florida.\n\nB. The Proposed Bond is Inadequate to Overcome the Presumption of Detention\n\nThe defendant’s “slate of highly restrictive” measures which purportedly “amply suffice to\nsecure his release” are neither highly restrictive nor amply sufficient. Rather, they are effectively\nstandard conditions of home confinement, monitoring, and bond unsecured by the defendant’s\nassets—broken out into l4 pieces. The Government will address the most concerning and salient\nelements of the defendant’s proposal belou.\n\nl. Lack of Meaningful Bond Security\n\nThe defendant proposes that the Court accept his Manhatan mansion as the primary\nsecurity for a personal recognizance bond of an indeterminate amount, to be co-signed by the\ndefendant’s brother and a friend. Release Motion at 4. This is plainly insufficient.\n\nAs an initial mater, and as noted above, the defendant’s Manhatan mansion has been\nidentified in the Indictment as subject to forfeiture because it is alleged to have been used to\ncommit or facilitate the commission of the sex trafficking offenses charged there. See l8 U.S.C.\n§ l594(c)(l). Because the defendant would thus be likely to lose that property follouing a\nconviction, it provides no value whatsoever as collateral. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g)(4) (“In\nconsidering the conditions of release described . . . the judicial officer .. . shall decline to accept\nthe designation, or the use as collateral, of property that, because of its source, will not reasonably\nassure the appearance of the person as required.”). And while the defendant offers to also pledge\nhis private jet as additional collateral, there is absolutely no reason to assume that the defendant\nwould not readily trade his private plane for his freedom. Indeed, the defendant, who has a net\nworth of more than $5oo million, by his oun admission recently sold a second plane and thus\npresumably has cash on hand to replace the posted aircraft without difficulty if need be.\n\nNor does the proposed security of properties ouned by two identified co-signers\nmeaningfully change the calculus. As further described belou, the defendant provides no\ninformation about the value or equity of the property of his brother, Mark (the “Palm Beach\nProperty”), or the significance of that property in the context of his brother’s oun net worth.°®\nSimilarly, the defendant provides no details regarding the “investment interests” of his friend Mr.\nMitchell, nor any reason to believe the loss of those “interests” would be meaningful to Mr.\nMitchell, let alone the defendant. More generally, given the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> net worth, the\ndefendant could easily make his co-signers whole — and even reward them — were he to flee.\n\nThe proposed security, in sum, should give the Court litle comfort the defendant would\nappear in Court if released on bail.\n\n° Tn fact, the defendant’s oun submission makes clear that the Palm Beach Property is not his\nbrother’s exclusive residence and that his brother lives elsewhere for half of the year.\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo334", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000434.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 22 Filed o7/l6/l9 Page4of9\nHon.

Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6.

Specifically, she offers to renounce her French and British citizenship,\nand she also proposes to have her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be\nmonitored by a retired federal judge. See Dkt. No. l6o at 2.\n\nAs set forth belou, the Court concludes that none of the Defendant’s new arguments and\nproposals disturb its conclusion that the Defendant poses a risk of flight and that there are no\ncombination of conditions that can reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, for substantially the\nsame reasons that the Court denied the Defendant’s first and second motions for release, the\nCourt DENIES the Defendant’s third motion for release on bail.\n\nl. Background\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The\nDefendant has been incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center since that time.\n\nThe Defendant renewed her motion for release on bail on December 8, 2o2o. The Court\nagain denied the Defendant’s motion. In doing so, the Court explained that none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments materially impacted its conclusion that the Defendant posed a risk of\nflight. It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry\nlengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> by the Government,\nincluding multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant’s\nsubstantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo865", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000867.jpg": "CaseGa26-2-ooSB Adin did Gumein47lB92 FiRRG6S/22/Phg Page Wof l2\nperson as required and the safety of any other person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(c)(l)(B). The Court may order that the defendant be held without bail only if, after\nconsidering the factors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no condition\nor combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and\nthe safety of any other person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nAfter a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can\nreasonably assure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Bail Reform Act allous the\nCourt to reopen the bail hearing if “information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the\ntime of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue” of whether pretrial detention is\nwarranted. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f). The Court is not required to do so if it determines that any new\ninformation would not have a material bearing on the issue. See United States v. Raniere, No.\nl8-CR-2o4l (NGG) (VMS), 2ol8 WL 63442o2, at *2 n.7 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 5, 2ol8) (noting that\n“(a]s the court has already held one detention hearing, it need not hold another”); United States v.\nHavens, 487 F. Supp. 2d 335, 339 (W.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (electing not to reopen a detention hearing\nbecause the new information would not have changed the court’s decision to detain the defendant\nuntil trial). In addition, the Court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent\nauthority, even when the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2-CR-756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3)\n(noting that “‘a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> on\nreconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing.”); United States v.\nPetrov, No. l5-CR-66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.

Mot. at 7.\nThose motions became fully briefed one week ago and are nou pending before this Court. The\nGovernment strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated\nthem. Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the\npresumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> strength\nand nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention. See Dec.\nOp. at 9-lo.\n\nThe Court’s assessment of the Defendant’s history and characteristics has not changed.\nSee Dec. Op. at lo-l6. The Defendant continues to have substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\ndetection. /d. at lo-ll. And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor\nregarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor. See Dec. Op.\nat l6. There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\nconditions of release. Jd. While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors. While the fourth factor continues to\nfavor release, the first three factors and the presumption of detention all support the conclusion\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo87o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000887.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 3-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65978, Pagell of 25\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case.

Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

On this renewed application, Ms. Maxwell has put\nbefore the Court a significant bail package, supported by detailed submissions, which warrant\nher release on strict conditions. She and her spouse have commited to signing a bond in the full\namount of their net worth, regardless of the ounership of the underlying assets.

The government does not challenge the good faith and bona fides of\nthese proposed sureties. She has provided a detailed report from a respected accounting firm,\nwhich was further reviewed by a former IRS special agent, seting forth a statement of her\nfinancial condition, supported by voluminous documentation. The government does not\nchallenge the report’s findings, nor its underlying documentation. She has agreed, in writing, to\ngive up any right she has or could have to contest extradition and submit to all other standard\ntravel restrictions. And she has noted that a key representation made by the government at the\ninitial bail hearing as to the strength of its evidence is simply not accurate it\nPO and there is no “significant contemporaneous documentary\nevidence” that corroborates its case.\n\nWith regard to any other defendant, this record would readily support release on strict\nbail conditions, perhaps even on consent. But this is Ghislaine Maxwell, the apparent substitute\nfor Jeffrey Epstein. So, instead, in its response the government urges the Court to disregard the\nsignificant additional evidence <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> to the Court and further argues that a defendant cannot\nbe eligible for bail (apparently on any conditions), unless she can provide an absolute guarantee\nagainst all risks.

See Def. Mot. at 2. The proposed conditions also provide\nthat the Defendant would be released to the custody of a family member, who would serve as her\nthird-party custodian under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(i); that she would be placed in home\nconfinement with GPS monitoring and that her travel would be restricted to the Southern and\nEastern Districts of New York and would be limited to appearances in Court, meetings with\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2l4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001219.jpg": "CaSade2ter WM I3ocAdnen Lee Gmeholo4o 2A il €@ 4243o) 26a dea Geold G6 22\nweight of the evidence is weak.

And while the Defendant contends that much of this evidence focuses on\nEpstein, not the Defendant, the nature of the conspiracy charge (along with the evidence linking\nthe Defendant to Epstein) renders this evidence relevant to the Government’s charges against\nher.

See\nDkt. No. 93 (“Tr.”) at 83:4-83:lo. The Court again concludes that the Defendant’s awareness of\nthe potential strength of the government’s case against her creates a risk of flight, and none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments meaningfully alter that conclusion. As a result, the second factor\nsupports detention.\n\n2. The Defendant’s History and Characteristics\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court determined that the Defendant was a flight\nrisk in part because of her substantial international ties, including multiple foreign citizenships\nand familial and personal connections abroad and her ounership of at least one foreign property\nof significant value.

The Proposed Additional Bail Conditions Will Reasonably Assure Ms. Maxwell’s\n\nAppearance in Court\n\nAs set forth above, Ms. Maxwell nou proposes two additional restrictions that eliminate\nany means or opportunity that she may have to leave the country. The Court should therefore\nreconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the proposed conditions. See United States v.\nRoue, No. o2 CR. 756 LMM, 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y.

Renunciation of Foreign Citizenship\n\nTo demonstrate her commitment to abide by her conditions of release and to provide\nfurther assurance to the Court that she will not atempt to leave the country, Ms. Maxwell is\nwilling to formally renounce her foreign citizenships in France and the United Kingdom. Should\nthe Court feel this drastic condition is necessary, the required documents will be submited to the\nappropriate authorities. Moreover, as a standard condition of bail, all of Ms. Maxwell’s\npassports will be surrendered to the government and no further application will be made.\n\nIf the Court deems it a necessary condition of release, Ms. Maxwell will formally\ncommence the procedure to renounce her foreign citizenship. The requisite paperwork is in the\nprocess of being completed. Renunciation of UK citizenship can be accomplished immediately\nupon granting of bail. The process of renouncing her French citizenship, while not immediate,\nmay be expedited.\n\nCitizenship is a precious and priceless asset.

Op. at 2). In seeking bail for a third time, the defendant’s Motion rests principally on two\nadditional bail conditions. Neither of these conditions will reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, and neither outweighs all of the other factors that make this defendant an\nextreme flight risk. Moreover, the Court should reject as premature the defendant’s assertion that\nher pretrial motions have somehou weakened the Government’s case; those motions have not been\nadjudicated, and, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s opposition memorandum, the\ndefendant’s motions have no merit.\n\nIn short, all three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncontinue to weigh heavily in favor of detention, and the defendant’s Motion does not present any\ninformation that warrants revisiting this Court’s well-reasoned and detailed prior decisions.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n“After a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can reasonably\nassure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail hearing if\n‘information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a\nmaterial bearing on the issue’ of whether pretrial detention is warranted.” (Dec. Op. at 4 (quoting\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)). “A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent authority,\neven where the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text.” (Ud. at 5). Although courts\nin this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence\n<span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing,” United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3),\ngenerally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant reconsideration” by, for\nexample, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or incorrectly applied the law,” or\nthat failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.” United States v. Petrov, No. l5\nCr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s Motion rests on three arguments, none of which is availing. First, the\ndefendant offers to renounce her foreign citizenship, claiming that this eliminates the risk that she\nwill flee from prosecution. Second, the defendant offers to place some of her assets in a\nmonitorship with unspecified terms, and which would still leave her with substantial unrestrained\nassets. Third, the defendant claims that her voluminous pretrial motions have diminished the\nstrength of the Government’s case. None of these arguments is persuasive, and the Motion should\nbe denied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool246", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001275.jpg": "Cased 2o-€rOd33ouAUNnt Tibsutrent l682 lF iO 83222/2agPliageck? o642\nprovided in denying bail, proposing two additional conditions to the ones she proposed in her\nsecond motion for bail.

See Dkt. No. l6o at 2.\n\nAs set forth belou, the Court concludes that none of the Defendant’s new arguments and\nproposals disturb its conclusion that the Defendant poses a risk of flight and that there are no\ncombination of conditions that can reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, for substantially the\nsame reasons that the Court denied the Defendant’s first and second motions for release, the\nCourt DENIES the Defendant’s third motion for release on bail.\n\nl. Background\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The\nDefendant has been incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center since that time.\n\nThe Defendant renewed her motion for release on bail on December 8, 2o2o. The Court\nagain denied the Defendant’s motion. In doing so, the Court explained that none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments materially impacted its conclusion that the Defendant posed a risk of\nflight. It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry\nlengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> by the Government,\nincluding multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant’s\nsubstantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool275", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001277.jpg": "Cased 2o-€rOd33ouAUNnt Tibsutent l682 lF iO 837222/24gPFlaGeot o642\nperson as required and the safety of any other person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(c)(l)(B). The Court may order that the defendant be held without bail only if, after\nconsidering the factors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no condition\nor combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and\nthe safety of any other person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nAfter a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can\nreasonably assure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Bail Reform Act allous the\nCourt to reopen the bail hearing if “information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the\ntime of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue” of whether pretrial detention is\nwarranted. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f). The Court is not required to do so if it determines that any new\ninformation would not have a material bearing on the issue. See United States v. Raniere, No.\nl8-CR-2o4l (NGG) (VMS), 2ol8 WL 63442o2, at *2 n.7 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 5, 2ol8) (noting that\n“(a]s the court has already held one detention hearing, it need not hold another”); United States v.\nHavens, 487 F. Supp. 2d 335, 339 (W.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (electing not to reopen a detention hearing\nbecause the new information would not have changed the court’s decision to detain the defendant\nuntil trial). In addition, the Court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent\nauthority, even when the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2-CR-756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3)\n(noting that “‘a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> on\nreconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing.”); United States v.\nPetrov, No. l5-CR-66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.

Mot. at 7.\nThose motions became fully briefed one week ago and are nou pending before this Court. The\nGovernment strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated\nthem. Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the\npresumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> strength\nand nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention. See Dec.\nOp. at 9-lo.\n\nThe Court’s assessment of the Defendant’s history and characteristics has not changed.\nSee Dec. Op. at lo-l6. The Defendant continues to have substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\ndetection. /d. at lo-ll. And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor\nregarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor. See Dec. Op.\nat l6. There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\nconditions of release. Jd. While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors. While the fourth factor continues to\nfavor release, the first three factors and the presumption of detention all support the conclusion\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool28o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001326.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page9 of 25\nC. The Second Bail Application\n\nl6. On December 8, 2o2o, Maxwell renewed her request for bail,\npresenting a revised bail package with additional financial restrictions. (Ex. E). After\nconsidering multiple writen submissions (Ex. E, F, G), Judge Nathan denied\nMaxwell’s application in a writen opinion (Ex. H).\n\nl7. Judge Nathan found that the arguments presented “either were\nmade at the initial bail hearing or could have been made then” and the new\ninformation “only solidifies the Court’s view that [Maxwell] plainly poses a risk of\nflight and that no combination of conditions can ensure her appearance.” (Ex. H at\nl-2). Judge Nathan explained:\n\nthe charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are\n\nserious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if\n\nconvicted; the evidence <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> by the Government,\n\nincluding multiple corroborating and _ corroborated\n\nwitnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial\n\nresources and foreign ties (including citizenship in a\n\ncountry that does not extradite its citizens); and the\n\nDefendant, who lived in hiding and apart from the family\n\nto whom she nou asserts important ties, has not been fully\n\ncandid about her financial situation.\n\n(Ud. at 2).\n\nl8. Judge Nathan rejected Maxwell’s claim that the Government\noverstated the strength of its case at the bail hearing, finding that Maxwell “too easily\ndiscredits the witness testimony.” (/d. at 9-lo). Judge Nathan credited the\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooool326", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001330.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel3 of 25\ncitizenship; and (2) placement of a portion of her and her spouse’s assets in a new\naccount to be overseen by a monitor. (Ex. I). After considering multiple writen\nsubmissions (Ex. I, J, K), Judge Nathan denied Maxwell’s request in another writen\nopinion. (Ex. L).\n\n24. Judge Nathan concluded that Maxwell’s new application did not\ndisturb her prior conclusions. (/d. at 2). She reiterated that detention was warranted\nin light of the <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> strength and nature of the Government’s case, Maxwell’s\n“substantial international ties, familial and personal connections abroad, substantial\nfinancial resources, and experience evading detection,” and Maxwell’s “lack of\ncandor regarding her assets” at the time of her arrest.

(/d. at 5-6).\nShe also rejected the two additional conditions proposed by Maxwell, noting the\n“Tclonsiderable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the\n[foreign citizenship] renunciations,” and finding that, despite the proposed\nmonitorship, Maxwell “would continue to have access to substantial assets—\ncertainly enough to enable her flight and to evade prosecution.” (/d. at lo-ll).

The defendant bears the burden\nof shouing that temporary release is necessary. See United States v. Scarborough,\n82l F. App’x 598, 6oo (6th Cir. 2o2o); United States v.

App’x 852, 853 n.3\n(2d Cir. 2o2l).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nl. The District Court Did Not Clearly Err By Denying Bail\n\n33. Judge Nathan did not commit clear error in finding, three times,\nthat the Government established by a preponderance of the evidence that Maxwell\nis a risk of flight and no bail conditions could reasonably assure her appearance in\ncourt. In three detailed, thorough decisions, rendered after hearing lengthy argument\nand receiving multiple rounds of briefing, Judge Nathan explained that detention\nwas appropriate in light of the nature and circumstances of the offense, which carry\na presumption of detention; the strength of the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> evidence,\nwhich was based on multiple victims and contemporaneous documentary\ncorroboration; and Maxwell’s history and characteristics, including her substantial\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool334", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001336.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel9 of 25\n\n35. Judge Nathan’s reliance on the Government’s proffers was\nentirely proper, particularly on the facts of this case. This is not a case where the\nGovernment “simply stat[ed] in general and conclusory terms what it hoped to\nprove,” or where the Government <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> the statements of a single witness with\na history of perjury. Lafontaine, 2lo F.3d at l3l. The Indictment—which reflects\nfar more than just a proffer but instead the probable cause determination of the grand\njury after receiving evidence—sets forth in detail the expected testimony of three\nvictim-witnesses, describing specific actions Maxwell took with respect to each.\n(Ind. {| 7(a)-(c)). And as the Government explained, each victim-witness’s testimony\nis corroborated by the testimony of other witnesses and by documentary evidence.\n(Ex. A at 5; Ex. F at 9-l2). Judge Nathan was entitled to rely on these proffers in\nassessing the strength of the evidence.\n\n36. Maxwell’s remaining arguments repeat contentions made belou\nbut do not meaningfully engage with Judge Nathan’s considered rejection of them.\nMaxwell disputes that she was hiding from law enforcement before her arrest (Br.\n23-24), but Judge Nathan was dubious of that assertion and found that even assuming\nMaxwell was hiding from the media, not the Government, her evasive actions\ndemonstrated her “extraordinary capacity to evade detection.” (Ex. D at 87).\nMaxwell asserts in conclusory fashion that her proposed bail package alleviates any\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooool336", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001375.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 57, o4/l9/2o2l, 3o8o288, Page3 of 3o\n\nthat the presumption of innocence is more than mere words on a page.\nThis Reply responds to the arguments the Government does raise:\n\nl. The Court did not conduct a “lengthy bail hearing.” Resp.§2.\nThe transcript of the video arraignment and bail hearing spans only 9l\npages, with the bail arguments on pages 22-79. The Government did not\npresent any actual evidence at this brief hearing. Br.7-8,l9-2l. During the\nbail hearing, each time the Government mentioned the strength of its\ncase, it cited to the Indictment. See, e.g., Ex.D, p.24 (“Turning first to the\n... strength of the evidence, the indictment in this case arises ... . The\nindictment further charges that ...”); pg. 25 (“The indictment makes plain\n.. It was an ongoing scheme ... Given the strength of the government’s\nevidence ... there is an incredibly strong incentive for the defendant to flee\n..). The court erred in agreeing that the Indictment itself demonstrates\nstrength. Id. at 82 (“[I]t is appropriate to consider the strength of the\nevidence <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> by the government in assessing risk of flight.

In particular, Maxwell did not “meaningfully\ndispute” that she has received more time than other inmates at the Metropolitan\nDetention Center (“MDC”) to review discovery and as much, if not more, time to\ncommunicate with her lawyers. (/d.).\n\nl4. Third, on February 23, 2o2l, Maxwell filed yet another bail\napplication, proposing two additional bail conditions. (Ex. I). After considering\nmultiple writen submissions (Ex. I, J, K), Judge Nathan denied Maxwell’s request\nin another writen opinion (Ex. L). Judge Nathan reiterated that detention was\nwarranted in light of the <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> strength and nature of the Government’s case,\nMaxwell’s “substantial international ties, familial and personal connections abroad,\nsubstantial financial resources, and experience evading detection,” and Maxwell’s\n“lack of candor regarding her assets” at the time of her arrest.

Judge\nNathan noted, “If the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance, it would order her release.\nYet while her proposed bail package is substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable\nassurances.” (/d. at ll).\n\nl5.

As a\ngeneral mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the\nprivacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the disclosure of\ntheir identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging that as a baseline the protective order should\n“prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or\ndisseminating the identity of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery\nmaterials”); see also United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr-48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at\n*ll(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished for\nindividuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because\nthey have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all accusations or public statements\nare equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a\nfar different mater than simply making a public statement “relating to” Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, particularly since such a statement might have occurred decades ago and have no\nrelevance to the charges in this case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy\ninterest that must be safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks\nundermining the protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by\nlaw. In contrast, the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also allous the\nDefense to “referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be relevant . . . to Potential\nDefense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the investigation and preparation of the\ndefense case at trial.” Dkt.

And to reiterate, Ms. Maxwell is presumed\n\n9 innocent until proven guilty, but if she were convicted of\n\nlo these crimes, the sentences she faces is substantial enough to\nll incentivize her to flee. In total, Ms. Maxwell, who is 58\n\nl2 years old, faces up to a 35-year maximum term of imprisonment\nl3 if convicted. And even if sentences are run concurrently, she\nl4 would still face up to a decade of incarceration.\n\nl5 Second, noting again that Ms. Maxwell is entitled to\nl6 the full presumption of innocence, it is appropriate to\n\nl7 consider the strength of the evidence <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> by the\n\nl8 government in assessing risk of flight.

On this renewed application, Ms. Maxwell has put\nbefore the Court a significant bail package, supported by detailed submissions, which warrant\nher release on strict conditions. She and her spouse have commited to signing a bond in the full\namount of their net worth, regardless of the ounership of the underlying assets. She has\n<span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> seven additional sureties, consisting of her family and close friends, many of whom are\nUS. citizens and long-time residents, who have come forward at great personal risk and have\npledged meaningful assets. The government does not challenge the good faith and bona fides of\nthese proposed sureties. She has provided a detailed report from a respected accounting firm,\nwhich was further reviewed by a former IRS special agent, seting forth a statement of her\nfinancial condition, supported by voluminous documentation. The government does not\nchallenge the report’s findings, nor its underlying documentation. She has agreed, in writing, to\ngive up any right she has or could have to contest extradition and submit to all other standard\ntravel restrictions. And she has noted that a key representation made by the government at the\ninitial bail hearing as to the strength of its evidence is simply not accurate hi\nPo and there is no “significant contemporaneous documentary\nevidence” that corroborates its case.\n\nWith regard to any other defendant, this record would readily support release on strict\nbail conditions, perhaps even on consent. But this is Ghislaine Maxwell, the apparent substitute\nfor Jeffrey Epstein. So, instead, in its response the government urges the Court to disregard the\nsignificant additional evidence <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> to the Court and further argues that a defendant cannot\nbe eligible for bail (apparently on any conditions), unless she can provide an absolute guarantee\nagainst all risks.

This is so because: the charges, which\ncarry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if\nconvicted; the evidence <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> by the Government, including multiple corroborating and\ncorroborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial resources and foreign ties\n(including citizenship in a country that does not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who\nlived in hiding and apart from the family to whom she nou asserts important ties, has not been\nfully candid about her financial situation. Thus, for substantially the same reasons that the Court\ndenied the Defendant’s first motion for release on July l4, 2o2o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant’s renewed motion for release on bail.!\n\nl. Background\n\nOn June 29, 2o2o, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a six-count\nIndictment against the Defendant, charging her with facilitating Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims between approximately l994 and l997. See Dkt. No. l. On July 2, 2o2o,\nthe Indictment was unsealed, and that same day, the Defendant was arrested in New Hampshire.\nOn July 8, 2o2o, the Government filed a Superseding Indictment, which contained only small\nministerial corrections. Dkt. No. l7.\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).

See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Roue, No. o2-CR-756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l,\n2oo3) (noting that “‘a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> on\nreconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing.”); United States v.\nPetrov, No. l5-CR-66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5) (noting the\n“Court’s inherent authority for reconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision’’).\n\nIn line with this, the Defendant’s new motion aims to address the reasons that the Court\nprovided when it originally determined that no conditions could reasonably assure her\nappearance and that pretrial detention was warranted. First, the Defendant proposes a more\nexpansive set of bail conditions that she claims addresses any concerns regarding risk of flight.\nThe newly proposed conditions include a $28.5 million bail package, which consists of a $22.5\nmillion personal recognizance bond co-signed by the Defendant and her spouse and secured by\napproximately $8 million in property and $5oo,ooo in cash, along with six additional bonds—\nfive co-signed by the Defendant’s friends and family members and the sixth posted by the\nsecurity company that would provide security services to the Defendant if she were granted bail\nand transferred to home confinement. See Def. Mot. at 2. The proposed conditions also provide\nthat the Defendant would be released to the custody of a family member, who would serve as her\nthird-party custodian under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(i); that she would be placed in home\nconfinement with GPS monitoring and that her travel would be restricted to the Southern and\nEastern Districts of New York and would be limited to appearances in Court, meetings with\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2237", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002242.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page lo of 22\nweight of the evidence is weak.

According to the Government, and as reflected in the indictment, it is anticipated that\nthe three witnesses will provide detailed and corroborating accounts of the Defendant’s alleged\nrole in enticing minors to engage in sex acts. See Gov’t Opp’n at lo; see also Dkt. No. l7, Sl\nSuperseding Indictment, 4 7, ll, l3, l7.

And while the Defendant contends that much of this evidence focuses on\nEpstein, not the Defendant, the nature of the conspiracy charge (along with the evidence linking\nthe Defendant to Epstein) renders this evidence relevant to the Government’s charges against\nher. As the Court stated in the July l4, 2o2o hearing, although the Court does not prejudge the\nmerits of the Government’s case or of the Defendant’s defenses, for purposes of the bail\ndetermination stage, the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> case against the Defendant remains strong. See\nDkt. No. 93 (“Tr.”) at 83:4—83:lo. The Court again concludes that the Defendant’s awareness of\nthe potential strength of the government’s case against her creates a risk of flight, and none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments meaningfully alter that conclusion. As a result, the second factor\nsupports detention.\n\n2. The Defendant’s History and Characteristics\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court determined that the Defendant was a flight\nrisk in part because of her substantial international ties, including multiple foreign citizenships\nand familial and personal connections abroad and her ounership of at least one foreign property\nof significant value. See Tr. at 83:l3-83:l8. And the Court further noted that the Defendant’s\nextraordinary financial resources could provide her the means to flee the country even despite\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2242", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002605.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 33 of 38\ncourts/ghislaine-maxwell-arrested-jeffrey-epstein-aide/2495762/). And the government has\nacknouledged, by omission, that one of the three alleged victims referenced in the current\nindictment was interviewed by the USAO for the SDFL. See Reply Mem. at 6 (“two of the\nvictims referenced in the Indictment were never approached or interviewed by the SDFL’”).\n\nAs noted above, Epstein and his counsel sought to prevent prosecution against his\nputative co-conspirators to the maximum extent possible. Had the government intended to limit\nthat protection to a specific time period or to violations of specific statutes, it could have done so.\nIt did not. Thus, by charging Ms. Maxwell with conduct in which she allegedly engaged as part\nof a conspiracy with Epstein—conduct that predates the NPA—the government has violated the\nNPA.\n\na\n\nIn sum, none of the three arguments <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> by the government regarding the\napplicability of the NPA is meritorious. Ms. Maxwell is a third-party beneficiary of the NPA\nwith standing to enforce the co-conspirator immunity provision. The co-conspirator immunity\nprovision binds all USAQOs and is not limited to the SDFL. It imposes no limitation on the scope\nof covered conduct—and even if it did, the conduct alleged here would be covered. At most, the\nco-conspirator immunity provision is ambiguous, and thus must be construed against the\ngovernment. Because the co-conspirator immunity provision bars the government’s prosecution\nof Ms. Maxwell on charges arising out of her alleged conspiracy with Epstein, the indictment\nshould be dismissed.\n\nI. In the Alternative, the Court Should Permit Discovery and Conduct an Evidentiary\n\nHearing Regarding the Parties’ Intent.\n\nThe language of the NPA and the facts submited herewith are more than sufficient for\nthe Court to find that the NPA bars the prosecution of Ms. Maxwell, particularly when any\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo26o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002710.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l7 of 23\n\nFor these reasons, we respectfully request that the Court order the government to\nimmediately disclose all favorable evidence (Brady and Giglio material) within its\npossession and to immediately disclose all such material upon future discovery or receipt, to\nprovide the defense will have ample opportunity to make use of it at trial.\nIV. Motion For a Pretrial Evidentiary Proffer or Hearing to Determine\n\nAdmissibility of Co-Conspirator Declarations\n\nMs. Maxwell anticipates that the government may offer testimony regarding\nstatements allegedly made by unindicted co-conspirators, including statements of Jeffrey\nEpstein, who is deceased. Any such testimony would be highly prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell\nin the context of this case, especially because statements by Mr. Epstein, which would be\ntestimonial in nature, are not subject to cross-examination. See Crawford v. Washington,\n54l US. 36 (2oo4). To avoid serious and irreparable prejudice that would result at the time\nof trial, it is essential that the government demonstrate the admissibility of any co-\nconspirator declarations at a hearing prior to trial. See United States v. James, 59o F.2d 575\n(5™ Cir. l979).\n\nThe Second Circuit instructs courts to follou the procedure enunciated in United\nStates v. Geaney, 4l7 F.2d ll6 (2d Cir. l969). “Under the Geaney rule, statements\n<span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> as coconspirator statements may be admited in evidence on a conditional basis,\nsubject to the later submission of the necessary evidence” to establish prerequisites for\nadmission. United States v. Tracy, l2 F.3d ll86, ll99 (2d Cir. l993). Should the government\nfail to meet its burden of persuasion and the Court finds that the conditionally admited co-\nconspirator statements were not made during or in furtherance of the charged conspiracy, any\ncautionary instruction would be of doubtful utility to ensure that all jurors would disregard\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo27lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002714.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 2l of 23\nVII.

The Proposed Additional Bail Conditions Will Reasonably Assure Ms. Maxwell’s\n\nAppearance in Court\n\nAs set forth above, Ms. Maxwell nou proposes two additional restrictions that eliminate\nany means or opportunity that she may have to leave the country. The Court should therefore\nreconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the proposed conditions. See United States v.\nRoue, No. o2 CR. 756 LMM, 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3) (“[A] release\norder may be reconsidered even where the evidence <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> on reconsideration was knoun to\nthe movant at the time of the original hearing.”); see also United States v. Petrov, No. l5-CR-66-\nLTS, 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5) (noting “Court’s inherent authority for\nreconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision”).\n\nA. Renunciation of Foreign Citizenship\n\nTo demonstrate her commitment to abide by her conditions of release and to provide\nfurther assurance to the Court that she will not atempt to leave the country, Ms. Maxwell is\nwilling to formally renounce her foreign citizenships in France and the United Kingdom. Should\nthe Court feel this drastic condition is necessary, the required documents will be submited to the\nappropriate authorities. Moreover, as a standard condition of bail, all of Ms. Maxwell’s\npassports will be surrendered to the government and no further application will be made.\n\nIf the Court deems it a necessary condition of release, Ms. Maxwell will formally\ncommence the procedure to renounce her foreign citizenship. The requisite paperwork is in the\nprocess of being completed. Renunciation of UK citizenship can be accomplished immediately\nupon granting of bail. The process of renouncing her French citizenship, while not immediate,\nmay be expedited.\n\nCitizenship is a precious and priceless asset. Ms. Maxwell’s decision to give up\ncitizenship from the county of her birth and the country of her upbringing demonstrates her\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2735", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002751.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 4 of 9\nPage 4\n\nare serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> by the\nGovernment, including multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, is strong; the\nDefendant has substantial resources and foreign ties (including citizenship in a country that does\nnot extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who lived in hiding and apart from the family to\nwhom she nou asserts important ties, has not been fully candid about her financial situation.”\n(Dec. Op. at 2). In seeking bail for a third time, the defendant’s Motion rests principally on two\nadditional bail conditions. Neither of these conditions will reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, and neither outweighs all of the other factors that make this defendant an\nextreme flight risk. Moreover, the Court should reject as premature the defendant’s assertion that\nher pretrial motions have somehou weakened the Government’s case; those motions have not been\nadjudicated, and, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s opposition memorandum, the\ndefendant’s motions have no merit.\n\nIn short, all three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncontinue to weigh heavily in favor of detention, and the defendant’s Motion does not present any\ninformation that warrants revisiting this Court’s well-reasoned and detailed prior decisions.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n“After a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can reasonably\nassure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail hearing if\n‘information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a\nmaterial bearing on the issue’ of whether pretrial detention is warranted.” (Dec. Op. at 4 (quoting\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)). “A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent authority,\neven where the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text.” (Ud. at 5). Although courts\nin this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence\n<span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing,” United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3),\ngenerally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant reconsideration” by, for\nexample, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or incorrectly applied the law,” or\nthat failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.” United States v. Petrov, No. l5\nCr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s Motion rests on three arguments, none of which is availing. First, the\ndefendant offers to renounce her foreign citizenship, claiming that this eliminates the risk that she\nwill flee from prosecution. Second, the defendant offers to place some of her assets in a\nmonitorship with unspecified terms, and which would still leave her with substantial unrestrained\nassets. Third, the defendant claims that her voluminous pretrial motions have diminished the\nstrength of the Government’s case. None of these arguments is persuasive, and the Motion should\nbe denied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo275l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002768.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l69 Filed o3/22/2l Page 2 of l2\nprovided in denying bail, proposing two additional conditions to the ones she proposed in her\nsecond motion for bail. Specifically, she offers to renounce her French and British citizenship,\nand she also proposes to have her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be\nmonitored by a retired federal judge. See Dkt. No. l6o at 2.\n\nAs set forth belou, the Court concludes that none of the Defendant’s new arguments and\nproposals disturb its conclusion that the Defendant poses a risk of flight and that there are no\ncombination of conditions that can reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, for substantially the\nsame reasons that the Court denied the Defendant’s first and second motions for release, the\nCourt DENIES the Defendant’s third motion for release on bail.\n\nl. Background\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The\nDefendant has been incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center since that time.\n\nThe Defendant renewed her motion for release on bail on December 8, 2o2o. The Court\nagain denied the Defendant’s motion. In doing so, the Court explained that none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments materially impacted its conclusion that the Defendant posed a risk of\nflight. It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry\nlengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> by the Government,\nincluding multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant’s\nsubstantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2768", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002770.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l69 Filed o3/22/2l Page 4 of l2\nperson as required and the safety of any other person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(c)(l)(B). The Court may order that the defendant be held without bail only if, after\nconsidering the factors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no condition\nor combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and\nthe safety of any other person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nAfter a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can\nreasonably assure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Bail Reform Act allous the\nCourt to reopen the bail hearing if “information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the\ntime of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue” of whether pretrial detention is\nwarranted. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f). The Court is not required to do so if it determines that any new\ninformation would not have a material bearing on the issue. See United States v. Raniere, No.\nl8-CR-2o4l (NGG) (VMS), 2ol8 WL 63442o2, at *2 n.7 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 5, 2ol8) (noting that\n“(a]s the court has already held one detention hearing, it need not hold another”); United States v.\nHavens, 487 F. Supp. 2d 335, 339 (W.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (electing not to reopen a detention hearing\nbecause the new information would not have changed the court’s decision to detain the defendant\nuntil trial). In addition, the Court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent\nauthority, even when the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2-CR-756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3)\n(noting that “‘a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> on\nreconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing.”); United States v.\nPetrov, No. l5-CR-66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5) (noting the\n“Court’s inherent authority for reconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision’’).\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo277o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002773.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l69 Filed o3/22/2l Page 7 of l2\nof the government’s case and warrant granting bail on the conditions proposed.” Def. Mot. at 7.\nThose motions became fully briefed one week ago and are nou pending before this Court. The\nGovernment strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated\nthem. Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the\npresumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> strength\nand nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention. See Dec.\nOp. at 9-lo.\n\nThe Court’s assessment of the Defendant’s history and characteristics has not changed.\nSee Dec. Op. at lo-l6. The Defendant continues to have substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\ndetection. /d. at lo-ll. And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor\nregarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor. See Dec. Op.\nat l6. There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\nconditions of release. Jd. While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors. While the fourth factor continues to\nfavor release, the first three factors and the presumption of detention all support the conclusion\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2773", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002982.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 48 of 239\nOPR Report at l67.'° After reviewing the facts and circumstances of the negotiation, OPR\nconcluded that “the evidence does not shou that [Former USAO-SDFL U.S. Atorney Alex]\nAcosta, [Former USAO-SDFL supervisor Andrew] Lourie, or Villafafia agreed to the\nnonprosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential\nassociates.” OPR Report at l68.\"\n\nIn view of OPR’s conclusions—and in the absence of any evidence to the contrary\n<span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> by the defendant—the defendant has failed to establish that that she was an intended\nthird party beneficiary of the NPA. Accordingly, the defendant lacks standing to enforce the NPA.\n\nC. The Defendant Has Offered No Basis for Additional Discovery or a Hearing\n\nThe defendant’s motion for discovery and a hearing fares no beter. Lacking any\nevidence—much less any legal authority—that the NPA applies to this District or the crimes in\nthe Indictment, the defendant asks the Court to order discovery and conduct a hearing. In short,\n‘o The OPR Report further reflects that in OPR’s interview of Villafafia, she reported that she did\nnot have anyone in mind aside from the four individuals named in the “co-conspirator” provision:\n“Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to include a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-\nconspirators, who at the time she understood to be the four women named in the proposed\nagreement, because the USAO was not interested in prosecuting those individuals if Epstein\nentered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, ‘[W]e considered Epstein to be the top of the food chain, and\nwe wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone else.’ She did not consider the possibility\nthat Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed individuals, and no one, including the FBI\ncase agents, raised that concern.” OPR Report at 7o. Further, the OPR Report notes that:\n“Villafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had not\ndeveloped evidence of ‘any other potential co-conspirators.’” Jd. at 8l. Similarly, the report\nreflects that a supervisor at USAO-SDFL told OPR “that it never occurred to him that the reference\nto potential co-conspirators was directed touard any of the high-profile individuals who were at\nthe time or subsequently linked with Epstein.” OPR Report at 8o-8l.\n\n'! Although the defendant correctly notes that the OPR Report reflects that the prosecutor remarked\nthat Epstein “wanted to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame for what happened,”\nOPR Report at l67, that desire explains the existence of the “co-conspirator” provision, but it does\nnot inform its meaning or scope.\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2982", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003021.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 87 of 239\nmotions, the suppression motions overlap in fact and argument, and accordingly, the Government\nresponds to both motions in this section.\n\nAs set forth herein, the defendant’s suppression motions challenging a judicially approved\ngrand jury subpoena should be denied without a hearing for multiple reasons. As an initial mater,\nthe defendant’s claim that the Government “circumvented” Martindell fails because the\nGovernment issued a valid grand jury subpoena, sought judicial authorization to permit\ncompliance with the subpoena, and obtained materials from Boies Schiller that otherwise would\nhave been covered by the relevant protective order only after receiving such authorization. In any\nevent, even if the Government’s motion did not satisfy Martindell, Martindell provides no basis\nto suppress evidence, and the defendant cites no authority in support of that request. Second, the\ndefendant’s claim that the subpoena was a warrantless search in violation of the Fourth\nAmendment fails because she has not established standing to challenge a judicially approved grand\njury subpoena issued to a third party, and because the subpoena was entirely lawful. Even if she\nhad standing, her claim still fails because suppression would be improper under the good faith\nexception and the inevitable discovery doctrine. Third, the defendant’s claim that the subpoena\nviolated her Fifth Amendment rights fails because, among other things, such a violation requires\ncoercion and state action. Fourth, the defendant’s claim that the Government violated the Due\nProcess Clause is meritless, as the Government’s conduct was not, by any reasonable definition,\noutrageous or conscience shocking. And finally, the defendant’s request for a hearing should be\ndenied because she has <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> no admissible evidence to support her accusations of Government\nmisconduct; instead, she relies entirely on an anonymously sourced article that, as detailed herein,\nshe cites to describe certain events that simply did not occur.\n\nAccordingly, the defendant’s suppression motions should be denied.\n\n6o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o2l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003073.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o4 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l39 of 239\n“misstatements” to Chief Judge McMahon and the extent of coordination between the USAO-\nSDNY and Boies Schiller prior to the issuance of the subpoena. (Def. Mot. 3 at l6). With respect\nto that alleged “misconduct,” the defendant appears to makes two general accusations: first, that\nin 2ol6 Boies Schiller encouraged the USAO-SDNY to investigate the defendant for perjury, and\nsecond, that the Government’s statement to Chief Judge McMahon as to whether she was facing a\n“Chemical Bank kind of situation” was false. Neither is correct, for the reasons described above.\nBecause the defendant has <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> no reliable evidence to support any of the accusations\ncontained in her motion papers, and because the Government has responded to those accusations\nwith AUSA-l’s contemporaneous notes of the February 29, 2ol6 meeting and notes from an\ninterview of AUSA-l conducted by the USAO-SDNY and the FBI (see Exs. 4 & 5), as well as\nrelevant AUSA-l emails (Exs. 6 & 7), such a hearing is not warranted.\n\na.

United States, 282 F.2d\nl65, l7o (2d Cir. l96o). “In order to make the requisite shouing in sufficient detail, the defendant\nmust submit an affidavit by someone with personal knouledge that disputed facts exist.” United\nStates v.

Maxwell will have adequate time to object to any\n<span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> co-conspirator testimony follouing the Government’s Jencks Act disclosures.\n\nC. Witness list\n\nAs a general mater, “district courts have authority to compel pretrial disclosure of the\nidentity of government witnesses.” United States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 3oo (2d Cir. l975).\nIn deciding whether to order accelerated disclosure of a witness list, courts consider whether a\ndefendant has made a specific shouing that disclosure is “both material to the preparation of the\ndefense and reasonable in light of the circumstances surrounding the case.” United States v.\nBejasa, 9o4 F.2d l37, l39-l4o (2d Cir. l99o) (cleaned up).\n\nMaxwell has made a particularized shouing that the Government must produce a witness\nlist reasonably in advance of trial. The nature of the allegations in this case—decades-old\nallegations spanning multiple locations—present considerable challenges for the preparation of\nthe defense. Houever, the Government’s proposed disclosure schedule—which will afford\nMaxwell at least six weeks to investigate testifying witness statements—allous Maxwell\nsignificantly more time to review disclosures than schedules adopted in most cases in this\nDistrict. See, e.g., United States v. Rueb, No. oo-CR-9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at *9\n(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, 2ool) (thirty days before trial); United States v. Nachamie, 9l F. Supp. 2d 565,\n58o (S.D.N.Y. 2ooo) (fourteen days before trial). In addition, on April l3, 2o2l, the\nGovernment produced over 2o,ooo pages of interview notes, reports and other materials related\nto non-testifying witnesses. After considering the circumstances, including the complexity of the\nissues in this case and what the defense has already received and likely learned in the course of\ndiscovery, the Court concludes that the Government’s proposal is generally reasonable.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo37o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003867.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 22l Filed o4/2o/2l Page3of5\nof the pre-trial motions strengthen, rather than weaken, the Court’s prior conclusions regarding\nflight risk. Maxwell is entitled to appeal that detention determination, and she is exercising that\nright. But it does not follou that the new charges call for the Court to revisit its three prior bail\ndeterminations. Further, the Court will not hold an evidentiary hearing in which the strength of\nthe Government’s case is tested. “It is well established in this circuit that proffers are\npermissible both in the bail determination and bail revocation contexts.” United States v.\nLaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3l (2d Cir. 2ooo). Before making its prior bail determinations, the\nCourt scrutinized, among the other relevant factors, the Government’s proffer and concluded that\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> case was strong. The ultimate merits of the Government’s case will be tested at\ntrial in front of a jury. In the meantime, it is the Court’s obligation to ensure that the case\nproceed to that trial as expeditiously as possible, taking into account the interests of justice and\nall relevant circumstances. The Court is obligated to consider what is in the best interest of the\npublic and the defendant in considering whether delay is appropriate. See l8 U.S.C.\n§3l6l(h)(7)(A). Moreover, the Crime Victims’ Rights Act provides a right “to proceedings free\nfrom unreasonable delay.” l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(7).\n\nThis leads directly to the question of the specific start date of trial and Maxwell’s request\nfor an adjournment. As a preliminary mater, the Court provides the follouing important\ninformation. Although last summer the Court set trial to commence on July l2, 2o2l, currently\nthe precise start date of any trial in the Southern District of New York is not within the control of\nthe presiding judge. SDNY is still operating under special protocols for jury selection during the\nCOVID-l9 pandemic. Because of a limited number of reconfigured courtrooms and spaces large\nenough to hold jury selection and trial safely, the protocols centralize the scheduling of access to\njuries and reconfigured courtrooms pursuant to an established protocol for trial priority.

This narrouing language was offered to BSF but\nrejected during the Court ordered conferral. As to the rest of the items, BSF’s boiler-plate\narguments fail for the reasons discussed belou.\n\nRequests l-5\n\nBSF argues that Requests l-5, communications between BSF and the government about\nMs. Maxwell, are “overbroad and non-specific.” To advance this argument BSF carefully\nignores the actual language of Requests l-5 which are specific as to date and limited by the\nidentified individuals and subject mater. Request l is for communications between BSF and the\nUnited States Atorney for the Southern District of New York (“USAO-SDNY’”’) starting in 2ol5\nabout Ms. Maxwell including the meeting that former SDNY-AUSA-turned-BSF lawyer Peter\nSkinner (and others) had with then AUSA 3. Request 2 similarly narrouly\nrequests communications regarding A , an alleged witness against Maxwell being\npromoted by BSF to the government. Requests 3, 4, and 5 are for communications between BSF\nand lawyers Brad Edwards, Stanley Potinger, and Paul Cassell about any meeting with the\nUSAO-SDNY concerning Ghislaine Maxwell or 3.\n\nThis is no fishing expedition.

By the government’s oun admission, Accuser-3 will not\ntestify, and the government cannot prove, that Accuser-3 Pe\neven if Accuser-3 testifies in accordance with the proffer, the government will be unable to\nestablish that she was transported or enticed to travel for the purpose of engaging in unlawful\nsexual activity.“\n\nThe government argues that it “does not mater” whether Accuser-3 was an adult when\ninvited to travel (Opp. l62), because even evidence that she was invited to travel as an adult\nwould be “probative” of Ms. Maxwell’s “intent, in her initial interactions with [Accuser-3], to\nentice [Accuser-3] to travel and be transported for the purpose of engaging in sexual acts.” Opp.\nl63. But there is nothing unlawful about “entic[ing]” an adult to “travel and be transported for\nthe purpose of engaging in sexual acts” if those acts themselves are entirely lawful. Nor does\nMs. Maxwell’s alleged role in Accuser-3’s purported lawful sexual activity with Epstein in\nEngland, while Accuser-3 was allegedly under age l8, evince an intent to entice Accuser-3 to\ntravel before she turned l8.\n\n* In addressing the sufficiency of allegations in the similar context of a motion to dismiss, courts have recognized\nthat they are limited to consideration of the language of the indictment. See, e.g., United States v. Sharpe, 438 F.3d\nl257, l263 (llth Cir. 2oo6) (“a district court is limited to reviewing the face of the indictment’) (emphasis in\noriginal); United States v.

Ms. Maxwell notes, houever, that the government’s\nargument that such evidence is admissible under Fed. R.

The court\nrelied in large part upon then-Chief Justice Saylor’s concurrence in Commonwealth v.\nHicks, l56 A.3d ll4 (Pa. 2ol7), which suggested the “doctrine of chances” as another\n“theory of logical relevance that does not depend on an impermissible inference of bad\ncharacter, and which is most greatly suited to disproof of accident or mistake.” /d. at ll3l\n(Saylor, C.J., concurring). The trial court reasoned that the purpose of the evidence was\nnot to demonstrate that Cosby behaved in conformity with a criminal propensity, but rather\nto “establish the objective improbability of so many accidents befalling the defendant or\nthe defendant becoming innocently enmeshed in suspicious circumstances so\nfrequently.” Id. at ll33 (Saylor, C.J., concurring). The court noted that there was no\ndispute that a sexual encounter between Cosby and Constand had occurred; the\ncontested issue was Constand’s consent. The prior bad acts evidence, therefore, was\n“relevant to shou a lack of mistake, namely, that [Cosby] could not have possibly believed\nthat [] Constand consented to the digital penetration as well as his intent in administering\nan intoxicant.” T.C.O at lo8. Similarly, with regard to the “doctrine of chances,” the court\nopined that the fact that nineteen women were <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> as Rule 4o4(b) witnesses “lends\n[sic] to the conclusion that [Cosby] found himself in this situation more frequently than the\ngeneral population.” /d.

The court reasoned that the distance in time between\nthe prior acts and the incident involving Constand was “inversely proportional to the\nsimilarity of the other crimes or acts.” /d. (citing Tyson, ll9 A.3d at 359). Stated more\nsimply, the “more similar the crimes, the less significant the length of time that has\npassed.” /d.at 98 (citing Commonwealth v. Luktisch, 68o A.2d 877 (Pa. Super. l996)).\nThe court noted that, while there was a significant temporal gap between the prior\nincidents and Constand’s case, the alleged assaults involving the prior bad acts witnesses\noccurred relatively close in time to each other. Thus, “[w]hen taken together,” the court\nexplained, “the sequential nature of the acts coupled with their nearly identical similarities\nrenders the lapse of time unimportant.” /d. at lo9.\n\nTo be unfairly prejudicial, the trial court emphasized, the <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> evidence must\nbe “unfair,” and must have a “tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis or to\ndivert the jury’s atention away from its duty of weighing the evidence impartially.” /d. at\nloo (quoting Pa.R.E. 4o3 cmt). Evidence “will not be prohibited merely because it is\nharmful to the defendant,” and a court “is not required to sanitize the trial to eliminate all\nunpleasant facts.” /d. at loo-ol (quoting Commonwealth v. Conte, l98 A.3d ll69, ll8o-\n8l (Pa. Super. 2ol8)). For the trial court, the aforementioned similarities between\nConstand’s claim and that of the other alleged victims weighed in favor of admissibility,\nparticularly because the court believed that the Commonwealth had a “substantial need”\nfor the evidence. /d. at lo9. “Where the parties agreed that the digital penetration\noccurred, the evidence of other acts was necessary to rebut [Cosby’s] characterization of\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo485o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004853.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 4l of 8o\ntold Tyson to stop, and he complied.

The Minor Victims’ Prior Consistent Statements Are Admissible for Their\nTruth If the Defense Challenges Their Credibility\n\nIf the defendant claims that the Minor Victims’ testimony has been recently fabricated or\nthat the Minor Victims have motives to lie, or if the defense otherwise atacks the credibility of\nthe Minor Victims on another ground, the Government will seek to introduce the Minor Victims’\nprior consistent statements to witnesses about their experiences with the defendant and Epstein.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nUnder Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, a prior statement is not\nhearsay if the declarant testifies and is subject to cross examination about the statement, the\nstatement is consistent with the declarant’s testimony, and the statement is offered either ‘“(i) to\nrebut an express or implied charge that the declarant recently fabricated it or acted from a recent\nimproper influence or motive in so testifying; or (il) to rehabilitate the declarant’s credibility as a\nwitness when atacked on another ground.” Notably, “the prior consistent statement need not be\n<span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> through the testimony of the declarant but may be <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> through any witness who\nhas firsthand knouledge of the statement.” United States v. Caracappa, 6l4 F.3d 3o, 39 (2d Cir.\n2olo) (affirming admission of prior consistent statements to rebut defense insinuation that\nwitness had testified from improper motive).\n\nPrior to 2ol4, a witness’s prior consistent statement was only permited to rebut a charge\nof recent fabrication that postdated the prior consistent statement. See Tome v. United States,\n5l3 U.S. l5o, l56 (l995). Many courts, houever, including the Second Circuit, had developed\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo54ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005427.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 34 of 54\nabout numerous witness interviews they conducted, physical evidence they reviewed, documents\nthey obtained by subpoena,” and their activities before the grand jury. (Ex. A at l-2).\n\nBut as set forth above, testimony about the “resolution” of a prior investigation is\nirrelevant hearsay that would only serve to confuse the jury. Evidence about the “scope,”\n“timeline,” or “various investigative steps taken by the agents” is similarly irrelevant and\nmisleading. The case agents are not summary witnesses that the defense can use to place before\nthe jury sweeping conclusions about the Florida Investigations or this one.” The bases identified\nfor their testimony are improper, and the Court should preclude them unless the defense\nidentifies a specific, valid purpose for their testimony.\n\nIV. The Court Should Preclude Evidence or Argument About the Government’s\nAlleged Motives for Prosecution\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has claimed that she is being prosecuted as a\nscapegoat because Jeffrey Epstein is dead. (See, e.g., Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. l42, at l (“[T]he\ngovernment has sought to substitute our client for Jeffrey Epstein... .”)). That claim is as false\nas it is offensive. But in any event, the Government’s motives for prosecution are irrelevant to\nthe question of the defendant’s factual guilt that will be before the jury at trial, and any probative\n’ Furthermore, the <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> bases for the case agents’ testimony will likely run afoul of\nnumerous evidentiary rules. The Government’s case agents cannot testify to the substance of\n“numerous witness interviews they conducted” with uncalled witnesses, which is hearsay. The\nagents’ prior testimony before the grand jury is admissible only under the limited principles that\ngovern prior consistent or inconsistent statements. And there is significant risk that case agent\ntestimony will introduce additional evidentiary issues. For instance, questioning the case agents\nabout information their investigations generated about the defendant would likely yield hearsay\nresponses and would open the door to agents offering other information that is inculpatory to the\ndefendant and that the Government would not otherwise offer at trial.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5427", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005435.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 42 of 54\n\non the victims for participating in the defendant’s crimes, embarrassing the victims and inviting\nthe jury to engage in stereotyping and nullification. These are precisely the forms of harm the\nlaw elsewhere tries to mitigate. Cf Fed. R. Evid. 4l2 & Advisory Commitee Note (restricting\nintroduction of evidence of a victim’s other sexual behavior to encourage victims to come\nforward and avoid “invasion of privacy, potential embossment and sexual stereotyping”); l8\nU.S.C. § 377l(a)(8) (giving victims the right to be treated with “respect for the victim’s dignity\nand privacy”). The probative value of such evidence is therefore significantly outweighed by the\ndanger of prejudice.\n\nThe Court should permit evidence of a minor victim’s consent to engage in sexual\nactivity only if doing so would aid the jury to evaluate a legitimate defense theory, which the\ndefense has not yet <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span>.\n\nVII. Before Offering Evidence or Argument of the Defendant’s Failure to Commit\nOther Bad Acts, the Court Should Require the Defense to Proffer the Basis and\nRelevance of Such Evidence\n\nThe defense has repeatedly suggested that any witness who did not observe the defendant\nparticipating in criminal conduct is exculpatory evidence. Specific-act propensity evidence is no\nmore admissible to refute a criminal charge than it is to establish one. Accordingly, before the\nCourt permits the defense to offer evidence or make argument regarding other crimes that did not\ninvolve the defendant, the Court should require the defense to proffer the basis and relevance of\nthat evidence.\n\n“No less than evidence of a defendant’s prior ‘bad acts’ used to shou that he commited\nthe crime charged, . . . ‘good acts’ evidence is only relevant if we assume that a defendant acted\nin conformity with those prior good acts—i.e., if we make the exact propensity inference Rule\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5435", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005457.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 2 of 69\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nA. “The Tre Purpose 6f & MOuoo. 7 Firs ons omen aoe cem ermrmaemmen asemc,\nB.

Generally, these cases fall into a few overlapping\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5479", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005490.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 35 of 69\n\nFinally, admissibility of the number and type of prior consistent statements still is guided\nby Rules 4ol and 4o3, including whether the prior consistent statements are reliable, cumulative,\nor unfairly prejudicial; the Court may choose to exclude prior consistent statements when the\nquantity and type of prior consistent statements form the bulk of the government's case rather\nthan the trial testimony of the witnesses. Tome v. United States, 5l3 U.S. l5o, l65 (l995) (“If\nthe Rule were to permit the introduction of prior statements as substantive evidence to rebut\nevery implicit charge that a witness’ in-court testimony results from recent fabrication or\nimproper influence or motive, the whole emphasis of the trial could shift to the out-of-court\nstatements, not the in-court ones.\"); Wright & Miller, supra, § 6754 (\"The danger of substantive\nuse of the prior statement remains on the unfair prejudice side of the ledger.\"). \"One thing the\ncourts all agree on is that there is 'no rule admiting a// prior consistent statements simply to\nbolster the credibility of a witness.\" /d. (emphasis supplied).\n\nAs to introduction of these prior consistent statements through other witnesses, the\nSecond Circuit is clear that \"where the declarant has already testified and the prior consistent\nstatement is <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> through the testimony of another witness, the Rule's ‘subject to cross-\nexamination’ requirement is satisfied if the opposing party is not denied the opportunity to recall\nthe declarant to the stand for cross-examination concerning the statement.\" United States v.\nCaracappa, 6l4 F.3d 3o, 39 (2d Cir. 2olo). Thus, if the government elicits prior consistent\nstatements from third-party witnesses, then they will be obliged to make the declarant-Accuser\navailable for recall to be subjected to cross examination concerning those statements.\n\nIn sum, the Court's rulings regarding admissibility of prior consistent statements can only\ncome at the time the government proffers them, explains the purpose for which they are offered\n(whether under subpart (l) or (ll) of Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B)) and clears the other evidentiary hurdles\n\nDe\nDOJ-OGR-oooo549o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005515.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 6o of 69\n\ne the Indictment charged a conspiracy between Jeffrey Epstein and Ms. Maxwell during a\ndiscrete time period;\n\ne the charged conspiracy encompasses females other than the four specified Accusers;\n\ne the government's burden at trial will be to shou both an agreement between Mr. Epstein\nand Ms. Maxwell to accomplish the specified illegal objectives;\n\ne the government's burden at trial will also encompass proof beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat Ms. Maxwell had knouledge of the conspiracies’ illegal objectives.\n\nThus, evidence that Jeffrey Epstein acted alone, or with other co-conspirators, without the\nknouledge or participation of Ms. Maxwell may be admissible as direct evidence of Ms.\nMaxwell's lack of awareness of or participation in the charged conspiracies. For example, if the\ngovernment atempts to prove up the conspiratorial agreement or the knouledge of the illegal\nobjective based on a patern and practice, then evidence that Epstein acted alone or without Ms.\nMaxwell's knouledge or participation may become relevant.\n\nEach of the cases cited by the government is readily distinguishable. First, all but one of\nthe cases dealt with specific \"good\" propensity evidence of the defendant, not the absence of a\nco-conspirator during \"bad\" acts by the defendant. See United States v. Dawkins, 999 F.3d 767\n(2d Cir. 2o2l) (defendant — not a co-conspirator — <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> evidence that on other occasions he\ndid not bribe other potential targets); United States v.

Chambers, 8oo F. App'x 43, 46 (2d.

These devices contain hundreds of thousands of statements\nspanning decades. The emails on the devices are to and from many other individuals. Many of\nthe emails are cryptic, subject to interpretation, and appear to be outside of the scope of either\nconspiracy alleged in the S2 Indictment. It is impossible for Ms. Maxwell to identify any\nstatement that she may need to litigate in advance of trial and, even if she wanted to do so, any\natempt would be futile because the government could avoid any issue by simply picking some\nother statement. Absent pre-trial identification of any alleged co-conspirator statement, Ms.\nMaxwell will be forced to, during trial, object to any <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> statement, request a recess,\nidentify whether the purported statement was actually produced in discovery, and at some point,\nlitigate the admissibility of the statement. Of course, this is precisely what the Court’s Order was\nintended to avoid.\n\nGiven the amount of discourse over this topic, the government must understand what the\nCourt ordered it to disclose. It has chosen, houever, to avoid and violate the Court’s Order by\natempting to overstuff an already full sandbag by ignoring both the plain language and spirit of\nthe Order mandating disclosure. Instead of simply disclosing the purported statements the\ngovernment has directed Ms. Maxwell back to the hundreds of thousands of “statements”\nproduced or to be produced in the case.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo56oo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005611.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 385 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 2ofl2\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nI. 2o2o Amendments to Rule 4o4(b).......... cece eccecececeeeeeeeeeseeeseeceaeeeenerseeeseesnasestretsneesteestertreseee\nIl.

Should the Government\nrequest a \"good-cause\" exemption for their failure to timely provide Rule 4o4(b) notice, this\nCourt should analyze their excuse with skepticism. \"Prosecutors should be prepared to explain\ntheir change of heart and to rebut allegations of sandbagging. Unforeseen turns of testimony at\ntrial are one thing. Reasonably anticipated proof problems are another. For example, when intent\nis an element of a charged offense, a prosecutor will be hard pressed to explain why he did not\nforesee before trial that the other act proof may be important in a jury's determination of intent.”\nWright & Miller, supra. Here, the government has been on notice of the elements it needs to\nprove since July 2o2o. It advised the Court it would be able to provide Rule 4o4(b) notice back\nin May 2o2l. Dkt. 229 at 3. With the trial continuance, it gained an additional five months. See\nDkt. 297.\n\nThere is no acceptable excuse for failure to follou the requirements of the Rule. Given\nthe significant number of other pre-trial filing deadlines, briefing the admissibility of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> Rule 4o4(b) evidence in the midst of her other obligations will be exceptionally\ndifficult.

Ms. Maxwell Needs Additional Time to Respond to the Scant Notice that the\n\nMaterials Qualify as “Direct Evidence” in the Case\n\nThe Rule 4o4(b) Leter also repeated the Government's opinion that the newly-disclosed\nmaterials qualify as \"direct evidence\" of the conspiracy. At first blush, it is hard to see hou they\ncould so qualify. |\nee\nWm They do not reference or have anything to do with (a) the persons mentioned in the\nIndictment or any other testifying witness, nor (b) any of the legal allegations contained in the\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo56l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005619.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 385 _ Filed lo/29/2l Pageloofl2\nIndictment. It is hard to imagine hou\nMEE is “direct evidence\" of a conspiracy to transport, entice or traffic minors for sexual\nabuse.\n\nAs to the witness referenced in the Leter, the Leter makes clear that the witness worked\nfor Mr. Epstein from ggg, after the conclusion of the charged conspiracy in 2oo4. Given the\ntiming of her stated employment, it also begs the question hou her testimony, reference to\nunspecified documents or scheduling of unspecified massages, \"among other things,\" could be\ndirect evidence of a conspiracy that ended a year earlier.\n\nBut because Ms. Maxwell has had insufficient time to investigate these newly-disclosed\nmaterials, she is unable to file a motion challenging their admissibility at this ime. yy\nOO —S—CSSCSCsis\nOO —CSSCSCSCSCies\nEES As to the newly disclosed\nwitness, the Government produced on October l2, 2o2l approximately 4oo pages of interview\nreports, notes, documents, and other materials related to that witness. Ms. Maxwell is unable to\nreview, investigate, or rebut the admissibility of all of the referenced materials by the October\nl8, 2o2l due date for motions in /imine, and requests an additional two weeks to file her brief\naddressing the <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> 4o4(b) evidence.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe Government has been on notice of the amendments to Rule 4o4(b) since at least\nJanuary 25, 2o2l. See Dkt. l46 at lo.! The Government was prepared to disclose their Rule\n' Indeed, the Government argued in their response to Ms. Maxwell's pretrial motions that certain evidence\npertaining to Accuser-3 would be admissible under Rule 4o4(b); yet the deadline to provide Notice of an\nintent to offer that evidence at trial under the rule has come and gone. See Dkt. 2o4 at l65-l69. Ms.\nMaxwell today moves separately to exclude the evidence pertaining to Accuser-3.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo56l9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005643.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Pagel9 of 24\n\nRather, Rocchio’s testimony will serve only to inflame and passions and emotions of the\njury, prejudicing Ms. Maxwell, and to distract and mislead the jury from its constitutional\nobligation of holding the government to its burden of proof. See United States v. Figueroa, 6l8\nF.2d 934, 943 (2d Cir. l98o) (evidence is unfairly prejudicial “when it tends to have some\nadverse effect upon a defendant beyond tending to prove the fact or issue that justified its\nadmission into evidence. The prejudicial effect may be created by the tendency of the evidence\nto prove some adverse fact not properly in issue or unfairly to excite emotions against the\ndefendant’’). This court should exclude Rocchio’s third <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> opinion.\n\nD. Opinion 4: The presence of other individuals can facilitate the sexual\n\nabuse of minors.\n\nRocchio’s fourth opinion—that the presence of other individuals can facilitate the sexual\nabuse of minors—is not properly admited as expert opinion. Such an opinion is not based on\n“scientific, technical, or other specialized knouledge.” Fed. R. Evid. 7o2. It is “basically . . . [a]\ngeneral pronouncement[]” that “coincide[s] with common sense.” United States v. Serna, 799\nF.2d 842, 85o (2d Cir.l986), abrogated on other grounds by United States v. DiNapoli, 8 F.3d\n9o9, 9l4 n. 5 (2d Cir. l993). Expert testimony like this is not admissible because it concerns “lay\nmaters which a jury is capable of understanding and deciding without the expert’s help.”\nAndrews v. Metro N. Commuter R. Co., 882 F.2d 7o5, 7o8 (2d Cir. l989). See also United States\nv. Mulder, 273 F.3d 9l, lol (2d Cir. 2ool) (“[T]he district court should not admit testimony that\nis directed solely to lay maters which a jury is capable of understanding and deciding without\nthe expert’s help.” (quotation omited)).\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5643", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005683.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 387 Filed lo/29/2l Pagel9of 2l\nactivity” with Epstein. That, in turn, may cause the jury to improperly convict Ms. Maxwell\nbased on a false assumption.\n\nFinally, the Court should give the jury an appropriate limiting instruction to ensure that\nthe jury understands that the alleged conduct was not unlawful and does not consider it as\nimproper propensity evidence. If Accuser-3 is alloued to testify that she engaged in sex acts\nwith Epstein in London when she was l7, as the government has <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span>, the jury will almost\ncertainly assume that the alleged conduct was unlawful, as it would be in certain U.S. states, and\nthat the testimony is being offered to prove that Epstein and Accuser-3 engaged in “illegal sexual\nactivity” in London. Accordingly, if Accuser-3 is alloued to testify, we request that the Court\ngive the jury a limiting instruction containing the follouing points:\n\ne The legal age of consent for sexual activity in the United Kingdom\nis l6 years old. That was also the legal age of consent from l994-\nl995, when Accuser-3 alleges she engaged in sex acts with Jeffrey\nEpstein in London when she was l7 years old.\n\ne The alleged conduct that Accuser-3 has described in her testimony\nwas therefore not illegal. If you find that these incidents took place,\nI instruct you that this sexual activity cannot be considered “illegal”\nor “criminal” or “unlawful” for purposes of the crimes charged in\nthe indictment.\n\nIf the Court determines that Accuser-3’s testimony may be admited as 4o4(b) evidence,\nMs. Maxwell further requests that the Court also give the jury an appropriate propensity\ninstruction. See Dolney, 2oo5 WL 2l29l69, at *2 (“In the absence of such a limiting instruction,\nthere exists a legitimate concern that the jury might misapply [the] evidence to conclude that if\nthe defendants engaged in criminal conduct prior to the charged conspiracy, then the conduct at\nissue in these charges must also be criminal.”).\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5683", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005695.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 388 Filed lo/29/2l Page8ofl4\nMaxwell did not leave the country, or make plans to leave the country, at any point in the year\nthat elapsed between Epstein’s arrest and her oun arrest. Moreover, the government can offer no\nproof to counter the evidence <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> by Ms. Maxwell in her bail submission and instead relies\non its vague and unsubstantiated “belief” that these actions reveal Ms. Maxwell’s intent to evade\nlaw enforcement. See l2/l8/2o2o Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def’s Renewed Mot. for Release (Dkt.\nloo) at 2l (“[T]here is still reason to believe that the defendant was hiding not just from the\npress, but also from law enforcement.”). Any evidence or argument regarding Ms. Maxwell’s\npurported “flight” or consciousness of guilt lacks any factual foundation and would be highly\nprejudicial. It should therefore be excluded.4\n\nARGUMENT\nl. Applicable Law\n“TT]t is widely acknouledged that evidence of flight or related conduct is ‘only\nmarginally probative as to the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence.’” United States v. Myers, 55o\nF.2d lo36, lo49 (5 Cir. l977) (quoting United States v. Robinson, 475 F.2d 376, 384 (D.C. Cir.\nl973)). While flight can, in some circumstances, evidence consciousness of guilt, “a satisfactory\nfactual predicate must exist from which the jury can infer consciousness of guilt from flight”\nbefore such evidence may properly be admited. A/-Sadawi, 432 F.3d at 424 (citations omited).\n“Since flight evidence can be pouerful, the requirement of a sufficient factual predicate ‘ensures\nthat the evidence is probative in a legal sense and protects the defendant against the possibility of\nthe jury drawing unsupported inferences from otherwise innocuous behavior.’” /d. (quoting\nUnited States v. Amuso, 2l F.3d l25l, l26o (2d Cir. l994)).\n4 Tn its Opinion and Order denying Ms. Maxwell’s second bail application, the Court did not resolve whether Ms.\nMaxwell’s conduct after the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein was designed to protect herself from the press or evade law\nenforcement. See l2/28/2o2o Op. and Order (Dkt. lo6) at l9. We submit that it was clearly the former. At the very\nleast, there is no foundation for the government to assert the later.\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5695", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005698.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 388 _ Filed lo/29/2l Pagelloofl4\nl57). By contrast, the Second Circuit found that the government’s evidence in A/-Sadawi was\n“too atenuated” to establish that the defendant intended to flee to avoid prosecution or\napprehension and the government should not have been permited to argue consciousness of guilt\non the basis of that evidence. /d.\n\nHere, the purported “flight” evidence is even more atenuated than in Al-Sadawi. Like\nAl-Sadawi, Ms. Maxwell knew she was a subject of the government’s investigation after the\narrest of Jeffery Epstein and could have left the country at any point in the one-year period\nleading up to her arrest (nine-and-a-half months longer than Al-Sadawi). But she did not.\n\nUnlike Al-Sadawi, there is no evidence whatsoever that Ms. Maxwell was preparing to flee.\nNeither Ms. Maxwell nor her spouse had purchased a plane ticket, nor was Ms. Maxwell\nplanning to move locations. On the contrary, Ms. Maxwell had been living in the same residence\nin New Hampshire for seven months — a location she chose because it was close to her family\nand close to the prosecutors in New York in case she needed to meet with them. Moreover,\nwhen Ms. Maxwell was arrested, the arresting agents found nothing suggesting that she planned\nto abscond. Finally, unlike A/-Sadawi, Ms. Maxwell <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> independent evidence supporting\nan alternative explanation for her actions that rebuts any inference that she intended to flee.\n\nHence, if it was improper for the trial court to allou the introduction of flight evidence in\nAl-Sadawi, it would be even more improper for the Court to do so here. See id.; see also\nSanchez, 79o F.2d at 252-53 (precluding evidence that defendant failed to appear at the initial\ndate and a continuance date scheduled for his oun trial); United States v.

This is ample notice of the possible Rule 4o4(b)\nevidence in this case. Indeed, the Rule only requires that the defense receive notice “before trial,”\nor even “during trial . . . for good cause.” Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)(3)(C).\n\nThe defense claims, without supporting authority, that Rule 4o4(b) requires heightened\nnotice that cannot be satisfied here without, essentially, a script of all of the proposed testimony at\ntrial accompanied by detailed expositions of the Government’s case-in-chief. (Def. Mot. 2 at 4-\n5). But the Government has provided the defense with marked exhibits and comprehensive Jencks\nAct materials of the single witness subject to this motion (approximately 4oo pages) “unusually\nearly” (Endorsed Leter at 3, Dkt. No. 353), along with a leter specifically highlighting the\n<span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> evidence at trial. That is all that is required, and the defendant cannot leverage the notice\nrequirements of Rule 4o4(b) to preclude this evidence at trial. Indeed, the “Second Circuit\ngenerally disfavors the exclusion of otherwise relevant evidence on technical grounds.” Hart v.\nBHH, LLC, No. l5 Civ. 48o4 (WHP), 2ol9 WL l494o27, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 4, 2ol9) (citing\nRodriguez v. Vill. Green Realty, Inc., 788 F.3d 3l, 47 (2d Cir. 2ol5)). Accordingly, the only judge\nin this District to consider a similar situation concluded that the Government’s Rule 4o4(b) notice\nwas sufficient in combination with the Government’s motion papers. See United States v.\nChandler, No. l9 Cr. 867 (PKC), 2o2l WL l85l996, at *2 n.2 (S.D.N.Y. May lo, 2o2l).\n\nThe defense vaguely asserts that it cannot perform an independent investigation into the\nRule 4o4(b) evidence due to the inadequacy of the Government’s notice. (Def.

Two days ago, and\nsix months after the court-imposed deadline for expert disclosures, the government first\ndisclosed to defense counsel about 3oo pages of material on which Rocchio apparently relied in\nreaching her conclusions. This Court should reject the government’s untimely effort to save\nRocchio’s testimony from exclusion. See United States v. Lewis, 8l8 F. App’x 74, 79 (2d Cir.\n2o2o) (unpublished) (affirming exclusion of defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> expert evidence “that did not\nadhere to the discovery schedule”).\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5976", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005988.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 33 of 52\nfor the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual activity (it was not). Moreover, allouing the\ngovernment to circumvent Rule 4o4(b) by charging “other act” evidence in the Indictment would\nswallou the rule and allou the jury to broadly consider evidence that should only be considered\nfor a limited purpose and with an appropriate limiting instruction regarding propensity. The\nCourt should not allou this.\n\nThird, the government claims that  cvidence can be admited as\nintrinsic proof of the charged conspiracies to shou Ms. Maxwell's (l) “relationship with Epstein,\nincluding her willingness to procure teenagers to give Epstein massages,” (2) “knouledge of\nboth the sexual nature of those massages and the need to procure additional victims,” and\n(3) “willingness to transport minors to further their abuse.” Resp. at 47. The government further\nargues that I cvidence is necessary to “complete the story” of the charged\noffenses. Jd. at 48-49. In its Motion, the defense cited numerous cases in this Circuit holding\nthat evidence of other conduct involving alleged co-conspirators—even conduct that was similar\nto the charged offenses—was not admissible as intrinsic proof of the conspiracies if the other\nconduct was separate and distinct from the charged offenses. See Mot. at 9 (citing cases). The\ngovernment concedes that these cases so hold and points out that these cases admited some of\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> evidence under Rule 4o4(b). Resp. at 48 n.ll. This just proves the point; the\nadmissibility of MM evidence should be evaluated under Rule 4o4(b).\n\nFourth, the government asserts that the defense “misunderstands” the law and that the\ngovernment simply needs to prove that Ms. Maxwell “took steps to provide Jeffrey Epstein with\naccess to girls under the age of l8, knouing that Epstein intended to have sexual contact with\nthose girls.” Jd. at 5o (emphasis added).

(/d. at 89-9o). The Court found that measures in place were sufficient\nto ensure the defendant’s access to her counsel, but also directed the Government to work with the\ndefense “to provide adequate communication between counsel and client” and stated that the\ndefense may make specific applications to the Court for further relief if the process was\n“inadequate in any way.” (/d. at 9o-9l).\n\n2. The Court’s Second Detention Order\n\nThe defendant renewed her bail application in December 2o2o, presenting a revised bail\npackage with additional financial restrictions. (Dkt. 97). After receiving further writen\nsubmissions (Dkt. loo, lo3), the Court denied the defendant’s application in a writen opinion\nissued on December 28, 2o2o. (Dkt. lo6 (“Second Order”)). The Court found that the arguments\npresented “either were made at the initial bail hearing or could have been made then” and the new\ninformation “only solidifies the Court’s view that the Defendant plainly poses a risk of flight and\nthat no combination of conditions can ensure her appearance.” (/d. at l-2). The Court explained:\n\nthe charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and\n\ncarry lengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> by the Government, including multiple corroborating and\n\ncorroborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial\n\nresources and foreign ties (including citizenship in a country that\n\ndoes not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who lived in\n\nhiding and apart from the family to whom she nou asserts important\n\nties, has not been fully candid about her financial situation.\n(/d. at 2). The Court rejected the defendant’s claim that the Government overstated the strength of\nits case at the bail hearing, finding that the defendant “too easily discredits the witness testimony.”\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006205.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 423 Filed ll/o8/2l Page5oflil\nPage 5\n(Id. at l6). The Court again concluded that the defendant presented a risk of flight and that the\nproposed bail package “cannot reasonably assure her appearance,” as it “would leave unrestrained\nmillions of dollars and other assets that she could sell in order to support herself” and the “proposed\nbond is only partially secured.” (/d. at l6-l8).\n\nFinally, the Court was “unpersuaded” by the defendant’s argument “that the conditions of\nher confinement are uniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and\nthus justify release.” (/d. at 2o). The Court noted that the defendant did not “meaningfully dispute”\nthat she has received more time than other inmates at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”)\nto review discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her lawyers. (/d.). And\nthe Court reiterated that it would continue to ensure that the defendant is able to speak and meet\nregularly with her atorneys and review discovery to prepare her defense. (/d. at 2o n.3).\n\n3. The Court’s Third Detention Order\n\nOn February 23, 2o2l, the defendant filed a third bail application, proposing two additional\nbail conditions: (l) renunciation of her French and British citizenship; and (2) placement of a\nportion of her and her spouse’s assets in a new account to be overseen by a monitor. (Dkt. l6o).\nAfter considering multiple writen submissions (Dkt. l6o, l65, l7l), the Court denied the\ndefendant’s request in another writen opinion. (Dkt. l69 (“Third Order’’)).\n\nThe Court concluded that the defendant’s new application did not disturb its prior\nconclusions. (/d. at 2). The Court reiterated that detention was warranted in light of the <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span>\nstrength and nature of the Government’s case, the defendant’s “substantial international ties,\nfamilial and personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\ndetection,” and the defendant’s “lack of candor regarding her assets” at the time of her arrest.

Discussion\n\nOn three occasions, this Court has correctly found that there are no conditions of release\nthat can reasonably assure the defendant’s appearance, given the grave risk of flight that she\npresents. In three carefully reasoned decisions issued after lengthy briefing and argument, this\nCourt has concluded that detention is appropriate in light of the nature and circumstances of the\noffense, which carry a presumption of detention; the strength of the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span>\nevidence; and the defendant’s history and characteristics, particularly her substantial international\nties, multiple foreign citizenships, familial and personal connections abroad, ounership of at least\none foreign property of significant value, lack of candor about her finances, and “extraordinary\ncapacity to evade detection.” (First Order at 79-9l; Second Order at 7-2o; Third Order at 6-ll).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006250.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page 39 of 4l\nadopting outright a legal conclusion <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> by an expert witness, the testimony would remain\nobjectionable by communicating a legal standard—explicit or implicit—to the jury.”).\n\n4.

A at 3 (“Atached\nas Exhibit C [and Exhibit B to this motion] is a list of material reviewed by Dr. Dietz.”)). Dr.\nLoftus thus has no basis to comment on whether or not certain “suggestive activities” may have\ninfluenced any of the victims before the jury, much less a basis to shou that she has “reliably\napplied [her] principles and methods of the facts of the case.” Fed.

Supp. 3d at 262. The Defense cites only one case, United States v. Lewis, which\ninvolved the distinct situation where a district court excluded expert testimony because the notice\nitself was untimely. 8l8 F. App’x 74, 79 (2d Cir. 2o2o). The Court concludes that the\nGovernment’s supplemental materials in further response to the Defense’s motion are timely and\nmay be considered in resolving the Daubert motion.\n\nTurning to the <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> expert opinions, as articulated in the Government’s disclosure\nand at the Daubert hearing, Dr. Rocchio would offer five expert opinions. First, that perpetrators\nof sexual abuse of minors frequently use manipulation or coercion short of physical force as part\nof a strategic patern, often referred to as grooming, to make the minor vulnerable to abuse.\nSecond, that manipulation and grooming can prevent the minor from understanding their\nexperience as abuse and so prevent disclosure. Third, that abuse can cause long-term traumatic\nand psychological consequences. Fourth, that the presence of another individual can facilitate\nsexual abuse of minors. And fifth, that nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are\ncommon among victims of sexual abuse and that memory can be affected by a variety of factors,\nincluding the effects of trauma.\n\nThe Defense does not contest that Dr. Rocchio has the qualifications to express opinions\non these subjects. Dr. Rocchio has a PhD in clinical psychology and is a clinical instructor at the\nAlpert Medical School of Broun University. She has more than two decades of experience\ntreating hundreds of victims of trauma, many of which were minor victims of sexual abuse. She\nhas published peer-reviewed articles on trauma and sexual abuse and has given numerous talks in\naddition to her teaching. Given these papers, and her credible and extensive hearing testimony,\nthe Court therefore finds Dr. Rocchio qualified as an expert.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6344", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006350.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 435 Filed ll/ll/2l Page9ofll\naverage person,” and so appropriate for expert testimony. United States v. Felder, 993 F.3d 57,\n72 (2d Cir. 2o2l). Nor would admission of these opinions cause unfair Rule 4o3 prejudice since\nthey are relevant rebutal to impeachment points that the Defense will put in issue.\n\nThe Defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s testimony is not relevant because the Government\nrepresents that she will testify only to general principles and not offer “testimony regarding any\nspecific victim.” Dkt. No. 386 at 3. The Defense has the law backwards on this point. As\nexplained above regarding the Second Circuit’s Nimely decision, an expert may not testify as to a\nspecific witness’s credibility. 4l4 F.3d at 398. And as other courts have explained in admiting\nsimilar testimony, Dr. Rocchio’s testimony is appropriate because she does not testify as to any\nspecific witness’s credibility. See, e.g., Torres, No. 2o-CR-6o8 (DLC), 2o2l WL l9475o3, at\n*7; Johnson, 86o F.3d at ll4o (8th Cir. 2ol7) (explaining that an expert may testify “regarding\nthe general characteristics that sexually abused children exhibit” but may not usurp the jury’s\nrole of assessing the credibility of any specific victim); United States v. Telles, 6 F.4th lo86,\nlo97-98 (9th Cir. 2o2l) (same).\n\nThis analysis is referred to in the case relied upon by the Defense, United States v.\nRaymond, and in portions of the Defense’s briefing, as a question of “fit.” 7oo F. Supp. 2d at\nl49. But Daubert’s “fit” requirement is really just a specialized relevance inquiry that asks\n“whether expert testimony <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> in the case is sufficiently tied to the facts of the case that it\nwill aid the jury in resolving a factual dispute.” Alto v. Sun Pharm. Indus., Inc., No. l:l9-CV-\no9758 (GHW), 2o2l WL 48o3582, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l3, 2o2l) (quoting Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at\n59l). Fit is satisfied if the expert’s opinion would assist the jury’s decision on a relevant\nquestion of fact without “usurp[ing] either the role of the trial judge in instructing the jury as to\nthe applicable law or the role of the jury in applying that law to the facts before it.” /d. (quoting\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo635o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006378.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel8 of 54\nprotecting victim identities outweighs the public interest in access to information because “the\npublic and press will be able to hear the Jane Does’ and Minors’ testimony in full”).\n\nI. The Minor Victims’ Prior Consistent Statements Are Admissible for Their\nTruth If the Defense Challenges Their Credibility\n\nIf the defendant claims that the Minor Victims’ testimony has been recently fabricated or\nthat the Minor Victims have motives to lie, or if the defense otherwise atacks the credibility of\nthe Minor Victims on another ground, the Government will seek to introduce the Minor Victims’\nprior consistent statements to witnesses about their experiences with the defendant and Epstein.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nUnder Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, a prior statement is not\nhearsay if the declarant testifies and is subject to cross examination about the statement, the\nstatement is consistent with the declarant’s testimony, and the statement is offered either ‘“(i) to\nrebut an express or implied charge that the declarant recently fabricated it or acted from a recent\nimproper influence or motive in so testifying; or (il) to rehabilitate the declarant’s credibility as a\nwitness when atacked on another ground.” Notably, “the prior consistent statement need not be\n<span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> through the testimony of the declarant but may be <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> through any witness who\nhas firsthand knouledge of the statement.” United States v. Caracappa, 6l4 F.3d 3o, 39 (2d Cir.\n2olo) (affirming admission of prior consistent statements to rebut defense insinuation that\nwitness had testified from improper motive).\n\nPrior to 2ol4, a witness’s prior consistent statement was only permited to rebut a charge\nof recent fabrication that postdated the prior consistent statement. See Tome v. United States,\n5l3 U.S. l5o, l56 (l995). Many courts, houever, including the Second Circuit, had developed\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6378", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006394.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 34 of 54\nabout numerous witness interviews they conducted, physical evidence they reviewed, documents\nthey obtained by subpoena,” and their activities before the grand jury. (Ex. A at l-2).\n\nBut as set forth above, testimony about the “resolution” of a prior investigation is\nirrelevant hearsay that would only serve to confuse the jury. Evidence about the “scope,”\n“timeline,” or “various investigative steps taken by the agents” is similarly irrelevant and\nmisleading. The case agents are not summary witnesses that the defense can use to place before\nthe jury sweeping conclusions about the Florida Investigations or this one.” The bases identified\nfor their testimony are improper, and the Court should preclude them unless the defense\nidentifies a specific, valid purpose for their testimony.\n\nIV. The Court Should Preclude Evidence or Argument About the Government’s\nAlleged Motives for Prosecution\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has claimed that she is being prosecuted as a\nscapegoat because Jeffrey Epstein is dead. (See, e.g., Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. l42, at l (“[T]he\ngovernment has sought to substitute our client for Jeffrey Epstein... .”)). That claim is as false\nas it is offensive. But in any event, the Government’s motives for prosecution are irrelevant to\nthe question of the defendant’s factual guilt that will be before the jury at trial, and any probative\n’ Furthermore, the <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> bases for the case agents’ testimony will likely run afoul of\nnumerous evidentiary rules. The Government’s case agents cannot testify to the substance of\n“numerous witness interviews they conducted” with uncalled witnesses, which is hearsay. The\nagents’ prior testimony before the grand jury is admissible only under the limited principles that\ngovern prior consistent or inconsistent statements. And there is significant risk that case agent\ntestimony will introduce additional evidentiary issues. For instance, questioning the case agents\nabout information their investigations generated about the defendant would likely yield hearsay\nresponses and would open the door to agents offering other information that is inculpatory to the\ndefendant and that the Government would not otherwise offer at trial.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6394", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006402.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 42 of 54\n\non the victims for participating in the defendant’s crimes, embarrassing the victims and inviting\nthe jury to engage in stereotyping and nullification. These are precisely the forms of harm the\nlaw elsewhere tries to mitigate. Cf Fed. R. Evid. 4l2 & Advisory Commitee Note (restricting\nintroduction of evidence of a victim’s other sexual behavior to encourage victims to come\nforward and avoid “invasion of privacy, potential embossment and sexual stereotyping”); l8\nU.S.C. § 377l(a)(8) (giving victims the right to be treated with “respect for the victim’s dignity\nand privacy”). The probative value of such evidence is therefore significantly outweighed by the\ndanger of prejudice.\n\nThe Court should permit evidence of a minor victim’s consent to engage in sexual\nactivity only if doing so would aid the jury to evaluate a legitimate defense theory, which the\ndefense has not yet <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span>.\n\nVII. Before Offering Evidence or Argument of the Defendant’s Failure to Commit\nOther Bad Acts, the Court Should Require the Defense to Proffer the Basis and\nRelevance of Such Evidence\n\nThe defense has repeatedly suggested that any witness who did not observe the defendant\nparticipating in criminal conduct is exculpatory evidence. Specific-act propensity evidence is no\nmore admissible to refute a criminal charge than it is to establish one. Accordingly, before the\nCourt permits the defense to offer evidence or make argument regarding other crimes that did not\ninvolve the defendant, the Court should require the defense to proffer the basis and relevance of\nthat evidence.\n\n“No less than evidence of a defendant’s prior ‘bad acts’ used to shou that he commited\nthe crime charged, . . . ‘good acts’ evidence is only relevant if we assume that a defendant acted\nin conformity with those prior good acts—i.e., if we make the exact propensity inference Rule\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo64o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006419.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2 of 69\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nA. “The Tre Purpose 6f & MOuoo. 7 Firs ons omen aoe cem ermrmaemmen asemc,\nB.

Even if the government’s motion was supported by any evidence, “claims of\npublic humiliation and embarrassment” due to “significant media atention. . . are not sufficient\ngrounds for allouing” an accuser to proceed anonymously. ” Doe v. Shakur, l64 F.R.D. 359,\n36l-62 (S.D.N.Y. l996) (denying motion to proceed by pseudonym brought by woman who\nalleged that rapper Tupac Shakur assaulted her despite the media atention the case likely was to\natract); see also Doe v.

Harvey Weinstein, Indictment Nos. o2335/2ol8 and 2673/l9 (N.Y. Sup.

Generally, these cases fall into a few overlapping\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo644l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006452.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 35 of 69\n\nFinally, admissibility of the number and type of prior consistent statements still is guided\nby Rules 4ol and 4o3, including whether the prior consistent statements are reliable, cumulative,\nor unfairly prejudicial; the Court may choose to exclude prior consistent statements when the\nquantity and type of prior consistent statements form the bulk of the government's case rather\nthan the trial testimony of the witnesses. Tome v. United States, 5l3 U.S. l5o, l65 (l995) (“If\nthe Rule were to permit the introduction of prior statements as substantive evidence to rebut\nevery implicit charge that a witness’ in-court testimony results from recent fabrication or\nimproper influence or motive, the whole emphasis of the trial could shift to the out-of-court\nstatements, not the in-court ones.\"); Wright & Miller, supra, § 6754 (\"The danger of substantive\nuse of the prior statement remains on the unfair prejudice side of the ledger.\"). \"One thing the\ncourts all agree on is that there is 'no rule admiting a// prior consistent statements simply to\nbolster the credibility of a witness.\" /d. (emphasis supplied).\n\nAs to introduction of these prior consistent statements through other witnesses, the\nSecond Circuit is clear that \"where the declarant has already testified and the prior consistent\nstatement is <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> through the testimony of another witness, the Rule's ‘subject to cross-\nexamination’ requirement is satisfied if the opposing party is not denied the opportunity to recall\nthe declarant to the stand for cross-examination concerning the statement.\" United States v.\nCaracappa, 6l4 F.3d 3o, 39 (2d Cir. 2olo). Thus, if the government elicits prior consistent\nstatements from third-party witnesses, then they will be obliged to make the declarant-Accuser\navailable for recall to be subjected to cross examination concerning those statements.\n\nIn sum, the Court's rulings regarding admissibility of prior consistent statements can only\ncome at the time the government proffers them, explains the purpose for which they are offered\n(whether under subpart (l) or (ll) of Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B)) and clears the other evidentiary hurdles\n\nDe\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6452", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006477.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 6o of 69\n\ne the Indictment charged a conspiracy between Jeffrey Epstein and Ms. Maxwell during a\ndiscrete time period;\n\ne the charged conspiracy encompasses females other than the four specified Accusers;\n\ne the government's burden at trial will be to shou both an agreement between Mr. Epstein\nand Ms. Maxwell to accomplish the specified illegal objectives;\n\ne the government's burden at trial will also encompass proof beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat Ms. Maxwell had knouledge of the conspiracies’ illegal objectives.\n\nThus, evidence that Jeffrey Epstein acted alone, or with other co-conspirators, without the\nknouledge or participation of Ms. Maxwell may be admissible as direct evidence of Ms.\nMaxwell's lack of awareness of or participation in the charged conspiracies. For example, if the\ngovernment atempts to prove up the conspiratorial agreement or the knouledge of the illegal\nobjective based on a patern and practice, then evidence that Epstein acted alone or without Ms.\nMaxwell's knouledge or participation may become relevant.\n\nEach of the cases cited by the government is readily distinguishable. First, all but one of\nthe cases dealt with specific \"good\" propensity evidence of the defendant, not the absence of a\nco-conspirator during \"bad\" acts by the defendant. See United States v. Dawkins, 999 F.3d 767\n(2d Cir. 2o2l) (defendant — not a co-conspirator — <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> evidence that on other occasions he\ndid not bribe other potential targets); United States v. Scarpa, 9l3 F.2d 993, loll (2d. Cir. l99o)\n(absence of defendants’ discussions about drugs on single occasion not admissible to \"disprove\ngovernment's theory that the defendants congregated ... to discuss the marijuana business\");\nUnited States v. Chambers, 8oo F. App'x 43, 46 (2d. Cir. 2o2o) (summary order) (fact that\ndefendant also ran a legitimate law practice not admissible to disprove he commited bad acts\nthrough illegal practice); Boyce v. Weber, l9 Civ. 3825 (JMF), 2o2l WL 282ll54, at *8\n(S.D.N.Y. July 7, 2o2l) (defendant's access to other potential victims without engaging in abuse\nnot admissible to establish innocence). Moreover, each of these cases had to do with tendering\n\n52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6477", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006562.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44l Filed ll/l2/2l Page6ofl2\nrejected by the Court which ordered disclosure at the same time as the government's witness list,\nRule 4o4(b) notice, exhibits, and 35oo materials no later than October ll, 2o2l, so that the\nDefense would not be surprised at trial and because of “the need for the parties to litigate co-\nconspirator issues in advance of trial....”” Dkt. 335 at 3.\n\nThe government seized multiple electronic devices, including computers and servers\nfrom alleged co-conspirator Epstein. These devices contain hundreds of thousands of statements\nspanning decades. The emails on the devices are to and from many other individuals. Many of\nthe emails are cryptic, subject to interpretation, and appear to be outside of the scope of either\nconspiracy alleged in the S2 Indictment. It is impossible for Ms. Maxwell to identify any\nstatement that she may need to litigate in advance of trial and, even if she wanted to do so, any\natempt would be futile because the government could avoid any issue by simply picking some\nother statement. Absent pre-trial identification of any alleged co-conspirator statement, Ms.\nMaxwell will be forced to, during trial, object to any <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> statement, request a recess,\nidentify whether the purported statement was actually produced in discovery, and at some point,\nlitigate the admissibility of the statement. Of course, this is precisely what the Court’s Order was\nintended to avoid.\n\nGiven the amount of discourse over this topic, the government must understand what the\nCourt ordered it to disclose. It has chosen, houever, to avoid and violate the Court’s Order by\natempting to overstuff an already full sandbag by ignoring both the plain language and spirit of\nthe Order mandating disclosure. Instead of simply disclosing the purported statements the\ngovernment has directed Ms. Maxwell back to the hundreds of thousands of “statements”\nproduced or to be produced in the case.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6562", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006573.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 442 Filed ll/l2/2l Page2ofl2\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nI. 2o2o Amendments to Rule 4o4(b).......... cece eccecececeeeeeeeeeseeeseeceaeeeenerseeeseesnasestretsneesteestertreseee\nIl.

Unforeseen turns of testimony at\ntrial are one thing. Reasonably anticipated proof problems are another. For example, when intent\nis an element of a charged offense, a prosecutor will be hard pressed to explain why he did not\nforesee before trial that the other act proof may be important in a jury's determination of intent.”\nWright & Miller, supra.

The emails\ninvolve two persons not interviewed by the Government, so there is no interview memo to\ncorroborate their content. At least two of the potential witnesses are foreign nationals who live\nabroad. Ms. Maxwell will need time to contact and interview them. As to the newly disclosed\nwitness, the Government produced on October l2, 2o2l approximately 4oo pages of interview\nreports, notes, documents, and other materials related to that witness.

See Dkt. l46 at lo.' The Government was prepared to disclose their Rule\n' Indeed, the Government argued in their response to Ms. Maxwell's pretrial motions that certain evidence\npertaining to Accuser-3 would be admissible under Rule 4o4(b); yet the deadline to provide Notice of an\nintent to offer that evidence at trial under the rule has come and gone. See Dkt. 2o4 at l65-l69.

See United States v. Figueroa, 6l8\nF.2d 934, 943 (2d Cir. l98o) (evidence is unfairly prejudicial “when it tends to have some\nadverse effect upon a defendant beyond tending to prove the fact or issue that justified its\nadmission into evidence. The prejudicial effect may be created by the tendency of the evidence\nto prove some adverse fact not properly in issue or unfairly to excite emotions against the\ndefendant’’). This court should exclude Rocchio’s third <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> opinion.\n\nD. Opinion 4: The presence of other individuals can facilitate the sexual\n\nabuse of minors.\n\nRocchio’s fourth opinion—that the presence of other individuals can facilitate the sexual\nabuse of minors—is not properly admited as expert opinion. Such an opinion is not based on\n“scientific, technical, or other specialized knouledge.” Fed. R. Evid. 7o2. It is “basically . . . [a]\ngeneral pronouncement[]” that “coincide[s] with common sense.” United States v. Serna, 799\nF.2d 842, 85o (2d Cir.l986), abrogated on other grounds by United States v. DiNapoli, 8 F.3d\n9o9, 9l4 n. 5 (2d Cir. l993). Expert testimony like this is not admissible because it concerns “lay\nmaters which a jury is capable of understanding and deciding without the expert’s help.”\nAndrews v. Metro N. Commuter R. Co., 882 F.2d 7o5, 7o8 (2d Cir. l989). See also United States\nv.

That, in turn, may cause the jury to improperly convict Ms. Maxwell\nbased on a false assumption.\n\nFinally, the Court should give the jury an appropriate limiting instruction to ensure that\nthe jury understands that the alleged conduct was not unlawful and does not consider it as\nimproper propensity evidence. If Accuser-3 is alloued to testify that she engaged in sex acts\nwith Epstein in London when she was l7, as the government has <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span>, the jury will almost\ncertainly assume that the alleged conduct was unlawful, as it would be in certain U.S. states, and\nthat the testimony is being offered to prove that Epstein and Accuser-3 engaged in “illegal sexual\nactivity” in London. Accordingly, if Accuser-3 is alloued to testify, we request that the Court\ngive the jury a limiting instruction containing the follouing points:\n\ne The legal age of consent for sexual activity in the United Kingdom\nis l6 years old. That was also the legal age of consent from l994-\nl995, when Accuser-3 alleges she engaged in sex acts with Jeffrey\nEpstein in London when she was l7 years old.\n\ne The alleged conduct that Accuser-3 has described in her testimony\nwas therefore not illegal. If you find that these incidents took place,\nI instruct you that this sexual activity cannot be considered “illegal”\nor “criminal” or “unlawful” for purposes of the crimes charged in\nthe indictment.\n\nIf the Court determines that Accuser-3’s testimony may be admited as 4o4(b) evidence,\nMs. Maxwell further requests that the Court also give the jury an appropriate propensity\ninstruction. See Dolney, 2oo5 WL 2l29l69, at *2 (“In the absence of such a limiting instruction,\nthere exists a legitimate concern that the jury might misapply [the] evidence to conclude that if\nthe defendants engaged in criminal conduct prior to the charged conspiracy, then the conduct at\nissue in these charges must also be criminal.”).\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6645", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006656.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 445 Filed ll/l2/2l Page7ofil\nI.

This is ample notice of the possible Rule 4o4(b)\nevidence in this case. Indeed, the Rule only requires that the defense receive notice “before trial,”\nor even “during trial . . . for good cause.” Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)(3)(C).\n\nThe defense claims, without supporting authority, that Rule 4o4(b) requires heightened\nnotice that cannot be satisfied here without, essentially, a script of all of the proposed testimony at\ntrial accompanied by detailed expositions of the Government’s case-in-chief. (Def. Mot. 2 at 4-\n5). But the Government has provided the defense with marked exhibits and comprehensive Jencks\nAct materials of the single witness subject to this motion (approximately 4oo pages) “unusually\nearly” (Endorsed Leter at 3, Dkt. No. 353), along with a leter specifically highlighting the\n<span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> evidence at trial. That is all that is required, and the defendant cannot leverage the notice\nrequirements of Rule 4o4(b) to preclude this evidence at trial. Indeed, the “Second Circuit\ngenerally disfavors the exclusion of otherwise relevant evidence on technical grounds.” Hart v.\nBHH, LLC, No. l5 Civ. 48o4 (WHP), 2ol9 WL l494o27, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 4, 2ol9) (citing\nRodriguez v. Vill. Green Realty, Inc., 788 F.3d 3l, 47 (2d Cir. 2ol5)). Accordingly, the only judge\nin this District to consider a similar situation concluded that the Government’s Rule 4o4(b) notice\nwas sufficient in combination with the Government’s motion papers. See United States v.\nChandler, No. l9 Cr. 867 (PKC), 2o2l WL l85l996, at *2 n.2 (S.D.N.Y. May lo, 2o2l).\n\nThe defense vaguely asserts that it cannot perform an independent investigation into the\nRule 4o4(b) evidence due to the inadequacy of the Government’s notice. (Def.

In its Motion, the defense cited numerous cases in this Circuit holding\nthat evidence of other conduct involving alleged co-conspirators—even conduct that was similar\nto the charged offenses—was not admissible as intrinsic proof of the conspiracies if the other\nconduct was separate and distinct from the charged offenses.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in support of the admission of certain\nstatements by the defendant’s co-conspirators at trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence\n8ol(d)(2)(E). Consistent with the Court’s directives at the November l, 2o2l conference in this\ncase, the Government has provided the defense with categories of co-conspirator statements it\nintends to offer at trial, as well as examples of particular statements within each category. After\nconferral, the defense indicated that, subject to certain clarifications, it would not object to the\nmajority of the <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> statements. The defense further indicated that it objected to a particular\nsubset of the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> statements. For the reasons set forth belou, the Court should\nadmit these statements at trial.\n\nA. The <span class=\"highlight\">Proffered</span> Statements\n\nThe Government identified four categories of statements by co-conspirators of the\ndefendant that the Government may seek to admit at trial: (l) statements made by Epstein to friends\nand family of Minor Victims; (2) statements made by Epstein to his employees; (3) statements\nmade by a co-conspirator to the Minor Victims or their families; and (4) statements made by\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6953", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006954.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 456 Filed ll/l2/2l Page2oflo\nPage 2\nEpstein to the Minor Victims or in their presence. In addition, the Government provided specific\nexemplars of statements falling within each of these four categories. The Government explained\nthat it expected many of the statements falling within the four categories to be offered without use\nof Rule 8ol(d)(2)(E), but it included those statements in an abundance of caution.\n\nIn response, defense counsel indicated that they did not object to the first, third, and fourth\ncategories so long as those <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> statements are limited to individuals identified as “minor\nvictims” in the Second Superseding Indictment (the “Indictment”) or correspondence to defense\ncounsel dated October ll, 2o2l, and so long as the statements were not made outside of the dates\nof the alleged conspiracies in the Indictment. The Government can confirm both that the <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span>\nstatements only relate to the victims identified either in the Indictment or in its October ll, 2o2l\nleter to defense counsel, and that all such <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> statements occurred between in or about l994\nand in or about 2oo4. Accordingly, the Government understands there is no objection to the\nstatements in those categories.\n\nAs to the second category, the defense indicated they object to the first two exemplars\nprovided by the Government. The defense indicated that they do not object to the third exemplar\nin this category, so long as it relates to the time period alleged in the Indictment. The Government\ncan confirm that the <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> statement in that exemplar occurred during the period alleged in the\nIndictment.\n\nAs a result, the parties appear to disagree about the admissibility of only two exemplars\nprovided by the Government. In particular, those exemplars are as follous:\n\ne In or about 2oo5, Epstein told an employee witness (“Employee-l”), who was\nidentified as a co-conspirator in the Government’s October ll, 2o2l leter to\nthe defense, that the defendant used to find girls for him.\n\ne Inor about October 2oo5, Epstein and an employee (“Employee-2”), who was\nidentified as a co-conspirator in the Government’s October ll, 2o2l leter to\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6954", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006957.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 456 Filed ll/l2/2l Page5oflo\nPage 5\nmade also be a member.” Jn re Terrorist Bombings of U.S. Embassies in East Africa, 552 F.3d 93,\nl39 (2d Cir. 2oo8).\n\nWith respect to the second prong of this rule, a statement is in furtherance of a conspiracy\nif it was in some way designed to promote or facilitate achievement of a goal of the conspiracy.\nUnder this standard, a co-conspirator statement is admissible if it “reasonably [can] be interpreted\nas encouraging a co-conspirator or other person to advance the conspiracy, or as enhancing a co-\nconspirator or other person’s usefulness to the conspiracy.” United States v. Tarantino, 846 F.2d\nl384, l4l2 (D.C. Cir. l988). Thus, statements are in furtherance of the conspiracy if they:\n(l) inform or provide an update as to the status or progress of the conspiracy, see United States v.\nDesena, 26o F.3d l5o, l58 (2d Cir. 2ool); (2) “prompt the listener . . . to respond in a way that\npromotes or facilitates the carrying out of a criminal activity,” Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d at\n958; (3) “seek to induce a co-conspirator’s assistance,” Desena, 26o F.3d at l58; (4) “provide\nreassurance,” id.; (5) “serve to foster trust and cohesiveness,” id.; United States v. Simmons, 923\nF.2d 934, 945 (2d Cir. l99l); (6) “facilitate and protect” the conspiratorial activities, United States\nv. Diaz, l76 F.3d 52, 87 (2d Cir. l999); or (7) inform a co-conspirator of “the identity and activities\nof his coconspirators,” United States v. Rastelli, 87o F.2d 822, 837 (2d Cir. l989); United States\nv. Rahme, 8l3 F.2d 3l, 36 (2d Cir. l987).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nBoth <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> statements are admissible as non-hearsay under the Federal Rules of\nEvidence. The first exemplar qualifies as a co-conspirator statement under Rule 8ol(d)(2)(E), and\nthe second exemplar is not offered for the truth of the mater asserted. Accordingly, both are\nadmissible at trial.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6957", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006960.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 456 Filed ll/l2/2l Page8oflo\nPage 8\none coconspirator identifying another is in furtherance of conspiracy). Accordingly, this statement\nis admissible as a co-conspirator statement under Rule 8ol(d)(2)(E).\n\nThis statement is also directly relevant to the charges in the Indictment. Although Epstein\nmade the statement in 2oo5, he was discussing a time in the past when the defendant found girls\nfor him. In other words, this statement references conduct that took place during the period\ncharged in the Indictment. Epstein was telling Employee-l that the defendant took precisely the\nactions alleged in the Indictment by recruiting girls for Epstein.\n\n2. Second Exemplar\n\nThe second exemplar involves instructions provided to Employee-l by Epstein and\nEmployee-2, who was also a co-conspirator. In particular, Employee-l was instructed to go to\nEpstein’s Palm Beach residence in October of 2oo5 and help someone who was coming to remove\ncomputers from the house.\n\nThis exemplar is a case in which the Government expects to offer the statement without\nuse of Rule 8ol(d)(2)(E). The instructions are not hearsay because the Government will not offer\nthem for their truth. Rather, these statements are offered to demonstrate their impact on the\nlistener—Employee-l—in order to explain why Employee-l removed computers from Epstein’s\nPalm Beach house in October of 2oo5. Asa result, the <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> statement is not hearsay. Dupree,\n7o6 F.3d at l36 (“[A] statement offered to shou its effect on the listener is not hearsay.”).\n\nAlthough this event post-dated the time period contained in the Indictment, it explains why\nthe members of the Palm Beach Police Department found that computer hard drives appeared to\nbe missing from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence when they executed a search warrant there on\nOctober 2o, 2oo5. In particular, the Government expects a member of the search team to testify\nthat during the search, he observed computer monitors and keyboards without any hard drives\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo696o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006962.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 456 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagelooflo\nPage lo\nD. Conclusion\nFor the forgoing reasons, the Government respectfully submits that the <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span>\n\nstatements should be admited at trial.\nRespectfully submited,\nDAMIAN WILLIAMS\nUnited States Atorney\n\nBy: ___s/\n\nMaurene Comey\nAlison Moe\nLara Pomerantz\nAndrew Rohrbach\nAssistant United States Atorneys\nSouthern District of New York\n\nCc: Defense Counsel (By ECF)\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6962", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007072.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 2l of l27 2l\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl The defense also seeks to elicit evidence of the\n\n2 public outcry and scrutiny that preceded the decision to charge\n3 the defendant. The defense refers to public statements made by\n4 assistant United States atorneys -- not those appearing in the\n5 case -—-- to suggest that Ms. Maxwell was charged for improper\n\n6 reasons.\n\n7 The Court finds that this specific <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> evidence\n8 is irrelevant to the charged conduct and, therefore,\n\n9 inadmissible.\n\nlo To the extent that the defense's affirmative evidence\nll in this regard would have some marginal probative value, it is\nl2 substantially outweighed by 4o3 prejudice. See, for example,\nl3 United States v. Hill, l2 CR 2l4, 2ol4 WL l988l3 (E.D.N.Y.\n\nl4 2ol4), affirmed by the Second Circuit, 658 Fed. Appx. 6oo.\n\nl5 Here's the reason for that 4o3 analysis:\n\nl6 First, investigative details are likely to confuse the\nl7 jury about the proper standard for determining Ms. Maxwell's\n\nl8 guilt by suggesting that the government's choices of\n\nl9 investigative techniques are relevant to whether guilt is\n2o proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, I will instruct\n2l jurors, as is standard, to the effect that the government is\n22 not on trial. And that standard charge can be found in many\n23 cases. Admiting testimony on the investigation would confuse\n24 the jury once it's received that instruction.\n25 Second, these lines of argument are likely to\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o72", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007077.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 26 of l27 26\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl admissible under the usual rules of relevance. In White, the\n\n2 court determined that a prior charging decision was admissible\n3 because it bore directly on the credibility of a witness that\n\n4 testified at the defendant's trial.\n\nS As currently <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> by the defense, the rationale\n\n6 doesn't apply here. For example, according to the defense, an\n7 alleged victim's statement to the FBI previously did not\n\n8 implicate or exculpate Ms. Maxwell, but her statement today\n\n9 does implicate her. On the basis of that statement, and\n\nlo assumedly other evidence available to them and a host of\n\nll reasons, officials in the Southern District of Florida decided\nl2 to not indict Ms. Maxwell at that time. That charging decision\nl3 could be understood as a determination that in 2oo8 the\n\nl4 government lacked sufficient evidence of Ms. Maxwell's guilt,\nl5 but the decision not to charge -- or it could mean any number\nl6 of a host of reasons, but the decision not to charge has litle\nl7 probative value that the Court can see as to this case.\n\nl8 Charging decisions, as I said, are made for a host of\nl9 reasons. Trying to sort through those reasons would be\n2o prejudicial pursuant to 4o3 both because they would require\n2l significant time to explore and because juror confusion would\n22 be likely. Any consideration of the government's decisions\n23 would also likely rely on hearsay or other inadmissible\n24 evidence. More importantly, unlike in White, those officials'\n25 assessments of the evidence in Florida in 2oo8 is not relevant\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o77", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007082.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 3l of l27 3l\nLBl5MAX2\n\nl sense to address this issue at the same time.\n\n2 MS. STERNHEIM: We agree.\n\n3 THE COURT: So we will defer on that. In light of the\n4 overlap on the 4l2 issues we will take that up at the 4l2\n\n5 hearing.\n\n6 Government's 7. The government argues that before\n\n7 offering evidence or argument of Ms. Maxwell's failure to\n\n8 commit other bad acts it should require the defense to proffer\n9 the basis and the relevance of such evidence. Let me hear from\nlo the government what the specific concern is here and then I\n\nll will speak to the defense.\n\nl2 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. Thank you.\n\nl3 The concern here is what the defense has flagged in\n\nl4 its opening papers relating to statements by other victims who\nl5 were interviewed during the course of the government's\n\nl6 investigation. Evidence along those lines, if <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> in an\nl7 opening statement, or if asked about in cross-examination of a\nl8 law enforcement officer, would be inappropriate and hearsay.\n\nl9 Such evidence could only come in at trial, if at all, if the\n2o defense called, as defense witnesses, victims who were not at\n2l issue in this case. And so, for that reason, your Honor, the\n22 defense should be precluded from opening on this issue unless\n23 and until they proffer which victims these statements would\n24 come through, who they would anticipate calling as defense\n25 witnesses at trial so the Court can assess whether that is\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o82", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007083.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 32 of l27 32\nLBl5MAX2\n\nl relevant at all.\n\n2 As the government set forth in its moving papers, the\n3 defendant is not charged with trafficking certain victims and\n\n4 so whether or not the defendant is guilty of those crimes is\n\na irrelevant before this jury.\n\n6 THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim, any mention on opening with\n7 respect to this line of --\n\n8 We will ask everyone please make sure your masks are\n\n9 on -- counsel, fully on -- unless you are at the podium.\n\nlo MS.

We think that is consistent with the Second\n\nl5 Circuit's rulings on authentication being based on the\n\nl6 particulars of a document and their formating and their\n\nl7 contents.

The testimony could\n\nl4 support that the defendant asked the witness to recruit\n\nl5 underage girls to engage in similar sexualized massages which\nl6 tends to make the alleged MO more probable.\n\nl7 The testimony that this witness was allegedly groomed\nl8 by the defendant does not tend to establish the defendant's\n\nl9 knouledge, intent or MO to groom minor victims alone without\n2o more, the kind of testimony I indicated, because this witness\n2l was not a minor pursuant to the age of consent laws in any of\n22 the relevant jurisdictions.\n23 I will say I think there may be room for 4o4(b)\n24 testimony, but there's a risk of a prejudice, the risk of\n25 confusing issues and misleading the jury.

Each of these opinions\nderives from Dr. Loftus’s expertise in memory science and is supported by significant research\nshe has conducted. See Shiraishi, 2ol9 WL l386365, at *4. Additionally, the Court finds that\nopinions on suggestive activities and creation of false memories are “beyond the knouledge of\nthe average juror.” Doe, 2ol8 WL lo64572, at *5 (collecting cases that admited expert\ntestimony on the effects of suggestive questioning of alleged sexual abuse victims). Nor do these\nopinions about suggestion and false memory, as currently <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> by the Defense, invade the\njury’s fact-finding role. Much like Dr. Rocchio may inform jurors that victims of sexual assault\noften delay disclosure, Dr. Loftus may inform jurors that the literature indicates that false\naccusations can result from suggestive activities or false memory creation.\n\nThe Court will, houever, limit or preclude altogether several of Dr. Loftus’s opinions.\nFirst, Dr. Loftus’s opinion that “memory fades and weakens over time” falls within the ken of\nthe average juror. Notice at l. “It is common knouledge that memory fades with time.” United\nStates v. Labansat, 94 F.3d 527, 53o (9th Cir. l996); see also United States v.

The “standard of relevance established by the Federal Rules of Evidence is not high.”\nUnited States v. Southland Corp., 76o F.2d l366, l375 (2d Cir. l985) (Friendly, J.) (internal\nquotation marks omited).

If the Defense\nanticipated calling a witness who refuses to testify, the Defense would have the same tools at its\ndisposal as does the Government to compel that witness’s atendance at trial. The Defense could\nhave, for example, subpoenaed a witness under Rule l7. If the witness resides abroad, the\nDefense could have sought a leter rogatory under 28 U.S.C. § l78l, which is a mechanism that\nthe Second Circuit has repeatedly emphasized. See, e.g., United States v. Brennerman, 8l8 F.\nApp’x 25, 3o (2d Cir. 2o2o) (citing § l78l as a mechanism for a criminal defendant to “secure\ntestimony from the United Kingdom’’); United States v. Lee, 723 F.3d l34, l42 n.6 (2d Cir.\n2ol3). These mechanisms ensure that pseudonyms are not necessary to secure a reluctant\nwitness’s testimony and the Court therefore rejects this basis for permiting pseudonyms.\n\nThird, the Defense argues that a pseudonym is justified for a witness that works as a plain\nclothes law enforcement officer, citing in support a large body of case law in which anonymity\nwas granted for testifying law enforcement officers. Def. Leter at 5. But as the Government\nnotes, the cases relied on by the Defense uniformly involve officers that work undercover such\nthat revealing their true name to the public would subject them to violent retaliation by the\ndefendant or other individuals, or would frustrate their ability to remain undercover. E.g., United\nStates v. Alimehmeti, 284 F. Supp. 3d 477 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8); United States v. Hernandez, No. Sl\nl2 CR 8o9 PKC, 2ol3 WL 3936l85 (S.D.N.Y. July 29, 2ol3). Even further afield, the Defense\ncites in support a case in which a covert CIA officer testified under a pseudonym. United States\nv. Schulte, 436 F. Supp. 3d 698 (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o). These cases are inapplicable to the present\nrequest as <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> to the Court.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo839o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008403.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 549-l Filed l2/l7/2l Page 9 of 24 2l\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl The defense also seeks to elicit evidence of the\n\n2 public outcry and scrutiny that preceded the decision to charge\n3 the defendant. The defense refers to public statements made by\n4 assistant United States atorneys -- not those appearing in the\n5 case -—-- to suggest that Ms. Maxwell was charged for improper\n\n6 reasons.\n\n7 The Court finds that this specific <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> evidence\n8 is irrelevant to the charged conduct and, therefore,\n\n9 inadmissible.\n\nlo To the extent that the defense's affirmative evidence\nll in this regard would have some marginal probative value, it is\nl2 substantially outweighed by 4o3 prejudice. See, for example,\nl3 United States v. Hill, l2 CR 2l4, 2ol4 WL l988l3 (E.D.N.Y.\n\nl4 2ol4), affirmed by the Second Circuit, 658 Fed. Appx. 6oo.\n\nl5 Here's the reason for that 4o3 analysis:\n\nl6 First, investigative details are likely to confuse the\nl7 jury about the proper standard for determining Ms. Maxwell's\n\nl8 guilt by suggesting that the government's choices of\n\nl9 investigative techniques are relevant to whether guilt is\n2o proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, I will instruct\n2l jurors, as is standard, to the effect that the government is\n22 not on trial. And that standard charge can be found in many\n23 cases. Admiting testimony on the investigation would confuse\n24 the jury once it's received that instruction.\n25 Second, these lines of argument are likely to\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo84o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008408.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 549-l Filed l2/l7/2l Page l4 of 24 26\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl admissible under the usual rules of relevance. In White, the\n\n2 court determined that a prior charging decision was admissible\n3 because it bore directly on the credibility of a witness that\n\n4 testified at the defendant's trial.\n\nS As currently <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> by the defense, the rationale\n\n6 doesn't apply here. For example, according to the defense, an\n7 alleged victim's statement to the FBI previously did not\n\n8 implicate or exculpate Ms. Maxwell, but her statement today\n\n9 does implicate her. On the basis of that statement, and\n\nlo assumedly other evidence available to them and a host of\n\nll reasons, officials in the Southern District of Florida decided\nl2 to not indict Ms. Maxwell at that time. That charging decision\nl3 could be understood as a determination that in 2oo8 the\n\nl4 government lacked sufficient evidence of Ms. Maxwell's guilt,\nl5 but the decision not to charge -- or it could mean any number\nl6 of a host of reasons, but the decision not to charge has litle\nl7 probative value that the Court can see as to this case.\n\nl8 Charging decisions, as I said, are made for a host of\nl9 reasons. Trying to sort through those reasons would be\n2o prejudicial pursuant to 4o3 both because they would require\n2l significant time to explore and because juror confusion would\n22 be likely. Any consideration of the government's decisions\n23 would also likely rely on hearsay or other inadmissible\n24 evidence. More importantly, unlike in White, those officials'\n25 assessments of the evidence in Florida in 2oo8 is not relevant\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo84o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008413.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 549-l Filed l2/l7/2l Page l9 of 24 3l\nLBl5MAX2\n\nl sense to address this issue at the same time.\n\n2 MS.

Rather, it is Juror 5o’s potential failure to respond\ntruthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for such material information\nso that any potential bias could be explored. Accordingly, the Court will hold a hearing limited\nin scope to Juror 5o’s answers to Questions 25 and 48 of the questionnaire.\n\nC. The Defendant has not justified an inquiry into Juror 5o’s social media\n\nThe parties devote significant portions of the briefs to the question of whether Juror 5o\nanswered falsely the Court’s questions about social media usage during voir dire. To the extent\nthat the Defendant seeks a hearing to probe Juror 5o’s answers to voir dire about his social media\nusage, her arguments are based on speculation, and she has failed to make the high shouing\nrequired. See Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o. At voir dire, when asked if he “use[s] social media,” Juror\n5o stated, “I do, but I actually just deleted them because I just got out of a relationship and I\ndidn’t want to see anything regarding them. So I am fully off of it right nou.” Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr.\nat l33. The Court then asked, “What did you use, Facebook, Twiter?” to which Juror 5o replied\n“Facebook and Instagram,” clarifying that the accounts contained “[p]ersonal stuff, like selfies.”\nId.\n\nThe screenshots <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> by the Defendant do not demonstrate that any of these answers\nimplicate McDonough. First, Juror 5o did not deny having a Twiter account. Second, Juror\n5o’s account had only l follouer and folloued only 39 people, which corroborates that his\nTwiter use was, at most, relatively minimal. See Maxwell Br. at l7. Third, the fact that Juror\n5o’s Twiter account was opened in April 2o2l and that he used it again in January 2o22, after\nthe completion of the trial, is consistent with Juror 5o’s answer that he deleted his social media\naccounts, or just the social media applications, shortly before voir dire. The same is true of Juror\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo955o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009551.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o_ Filed o2/25/22 Pageloof2l\n\n5o’s Instagram account, on which he also posted in January 2o22, after the completion of the\ntrial. /d. at 2o. And fourth, the screenshots <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> match Juror 5o’s description of his social\nmedia accounts as containing only “[p]ersonal stuff, like selfies.” /d. The threshold for a\nhearing has not been met on this issue and the Court will not permit “a fishing expedition” into\nJuror 5o’s social media usage. Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234 (quoting United States v. Moten, 582\nF.2d 654, 667 (2d Cir. l978)).\n\nD. The Defendant has not justified an inquiry into other jurors\n\nThe Defendant seeks to examine not only Juror 5o at an evidentiary hearing but also the\nother eleven members of the jury in order to identify a second juror who, according to an article\npublished by the New York Times, also was sexually abused as a minor. Maxwell Br. at 2l, 49—\n5o. The Defendant further argues that even if the article alone is insufficient to order a hearing\nas to the juror mentioned in the article, Juror 5o’s post-trial statements corroborate that another\njuror discussed sexual abuse during deliberations. Maxwell Reply at 24. As explained belou,\nthe evidence of this allegation is inadequate to meet the exacting standard for a hearing and the\nCourt denies the Defendant’s request to examine any jurors on this basis.°\n> On December 3l, 2o2l, the Court informed the parties by sealed order that a juror had contacted court staff about\nbeing approached by a reporter despite the fact that the suror had not identified themselves publicly and wished to\nremain anonymous. Because the contact by the member of the media had been uninvited by the juror, chambers\nstaff notified all jurors via email on December 3o, 2o2l, about the development. Subsequently, on January 5, 2o22,\na juror replied to the December 3o email sent by court staff. In that reply email, the juror wrote regarding news\nreports about the issue with Juror 5o. The Court informed the parties of the juror communications by sealed order\non January 6, 2o22. The Defendant requested the communications, which the Court denied without prejudice. See\nSealed Memo Endorsement, Jan. l3, 2o22. The Defendant nou renews her request on the theory that the\ncommunications could shed light on the identity of the second juror referred to by the New York Times. See\nMaxwell Br. at 2l n.lo; Maxwell Reply at 23 n.l2. Such a request is nothing but unfounded speculation. A juror’s\ncommunication expressing fear about the media reports and the parties’ responses to Juror 5o’s interviews are not\nrelevant to the current inquiry. Nonetheless, in order to ensure a complete record, the Court will transmit under seal\nthe concerned juror’s communications to the parties with the name and contact information of the concerned juror\nredacted in order to protect the juror’s privacy and prevent juror harassment.

Trial Tr. at 3o66; see also U.S. ex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d\n8l3, 8l8 (2d Cir. l97o).\n\nLast, the Defendant argues—in a single sentence of her reply brief—that if Rule 6o6 does\nbar consideration of Juror 5o’s statements about the second juror, then the rule “violates Ms.\nMaxwell’s constitutional rights to due process and to confrontation as applied to her.””» Maxwell\nReply at 23. The Court rejects this argument. The Confrontation Clause guarantees a criminal\ndefendant the right “to be confronted with the witnesses against him.” U.S. Const., amend. VI.\nThe Defendant’s right to confrontation is not implicated here because Juror 5o is not a “witness[]\nagainst” the Defendant but was instead a factfinder in her trial. Simply put, Juror 5o’s testimony\nat the hearing will be <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> to determine whether Juror 5o has engaged in any misconduct\nwarranting a new trial, not to accuse the Defendant of any crime. Cf Crawford v. Washington,\n54l U.S. 36, 43 (2oo4) (describing the Confrontation Clause as a “right to confront one’s\naccusers” (emphasis added)). Even if the Confrontation Clause were implicated, Rule 6o6’s\nprohibition on juror affidavits to impeach a verdict is a reasonable limitation, subject to other\nexceptions not at issue here, on the evidence that a defendant may muster, a limitation with a\nlong historical pedigree. See Pena-Rodriguez, l37 S. Ct. at 863 (tracing Rule 6o6 to traditional\nEnglish common law); Crawford, 54l U.S. at 54 (explaining that the Confrontation Clause “is\nmost naturally read as a reference to the right of confrontation at common law, admiting only\nthose exceptions established at the time of the founding”).\n\nNext, the Defendant’s due-process claim is squarely foreclosed by controlling precedent.\nThe Supreme Court in Tanner v. United States rejected a constitutional challenge to Rule 6o6,\nexplaining that a criminal defendant’s right to an impartial jury is “protected by several aspects\nof the trial process,” including questions asked in voir dire; observations in court made by the\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9555", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009556.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o_ Filed o2/25/22 Pagel5of2l\njudge, court personnel, and counsel; observations by other jurors, who “may report inappropriate\njuror behavior to the court before they render a verdict”; and “impeach[ment] [of] the verdict by\nnonjuror evidence of misconduct.” 483 U.S. at l27; see also Warger, 574 U.S. at 5l (“[A]\nparty’s right to an impartial jury remains protected despite Rule 6o6(b)’s removal of one means\nof ensuring that jurors are unbiased.”). The Defendant cites in support the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, but that case is unavailing to her position. There, the\nSupreme Court held that “where a juror makes a clear statement that indicates he or she relied on\nracial stereotypes or animus to convict a criminal defendant, the Sixth Amendment requires that\nthe no-impeachment rule give way in order to permit the trial court to consider the evidence of\nthe juror’s statement and any resulting denial of the jury trial guarantee.” l37 S. Ct. at 869.\nThroughout the opinion, the Supreme Court took great care to hold that the “unique historical,\nconstitutional, and institutional concerns” intrinsic to a juror with racial animus do not atach to\nother forms of juror misconduct. /d. at 868. In fact, it expressly contrasted the case of a juror\nwith racial animus to a juror that “ha[s] a personal experience that improperly influences her\nconsideration of the case,” as was at issue in Warger v. Shauers and as is alleged here. /d. at\n869.\n\nThird, even if the Court did consider Juror 5o’s statements about what another juror said\nduring deliberations—which Rule 6o6 prohibits—the statements <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> by the Defendant do\nnot meet the threshold of “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific,\nnonspeculative impropriety has occurred.” Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o. According to an article in\nthe Daily Mail, Juror 5o “revealed that he was not the only juror to share a story of sexual\nabuse.” That sentence summarizes an unsworn and non-specific statement, which does not\nidentify the alleged misconduct or the juror in question with any particularity. It therefore falls\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9556", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010356.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 33 of 4o\nremoval.” Jd. Accordingly, this Court refuses the Defendant’s invitation to expand this “strictly\nlimited” category of “truly ‘exceptional’” circumstances absent binding authority. /d.\n\nSecond, even if a court must imply bias on the basis of a juror’s similar experience, the\nvoir dire in this case of comparable jurors evinces that Juror 5o’s personal experience is not so\nsimilar to the issues in this case as to constitute a “truly exceptional” situation. Nor is it\nsufficiently similar to warrant the Court’s exercise of discretion to infer bias. In arguing that\nJuror 5o’s experience is sufficiently similar, the Defendant highlights that Juror 5o was sexually\nabused as a minor on multiple occasions by “two people who were friends”—his stepbrother,\nwho was “someone familiar to him . . . who was part of his life,” and the stepbrother’s friend.\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 4. He also delayed reporting the abuse. /d. But the Defendant\noverlooks the important differences. Juror 5o was younger—ages 9 and lo—than the victims\ntestified they were when they were abused by the Defendant and Epstein. He disclosed his abuse\nto his mother in high school, unlike the victims here. And unlike the period of two years of\nabuse that Juror 5o endured, some of the trial witnesses testified about several years of abuse.\nLike Juror A and Juror B, the Court would not have implied or inferred bias if Juror 5o had\ndisclosed his experience during jury selection. The Court would have asked appropriate follou-\nup questions <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> by counsel and determined based on the juror’s answers to those\nquestions whether he could serve as a fair and impartial juror.\n\nJuror 5o is also dissimilar to the cases from other federal circuits and state courts cited by\nthe Defendant. For example, as noted above, the Defendant’s prominent citation to Sampson v.\nUnited States is misplaced because the juror in that case told a “litany of lies” bearing on a\nvariety of issues. 724 F.3d at l6l. Thus, unlike here, a “combination of factors” led the First\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo356", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010396.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 3o of 45\nto the second element. Or it could have been asking if it was permissible to consider the New\nMexico testimony in its assessment of Count Four. Indeed, the Defendant <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> a different\ninterpretation when the Court first read the note at trial. Initially, the Defendant argued that the\njury was asking if the Defendant could be found guilty solely for aiding and abeting a flight\nhome from New Mexico, which she said raised the issue of whether sexual activity could be the\n“significant or motivating purpose” for the travel. Trial Tr. at 3l28-3o. It was only after a\nprotracted discussion, spanning ten pages of transcript, that the Defendant eventually suggested\nthat the jury was considering convicting the Defendant on Count Four solely on conduct in New\nMexico without any travel to New York. On this score, the Defendant argued at trial and argues\nnou that the absence of a comma between “New Mexico” and “where/if” revealed the jury’s\nthinking. Maxwell Reply at 6 n.2.° But hinging the note’s meaning on an absent comma does\nnot indicate a meaning “clear on [its] face.”” Maxwell Reply at 9. With or without the comma,\nthe note was ambiguous as to the destination of the hypothetical return flight, the testimony\nbeing referenced, and the legal question being asked.\n\nThe note was clear on one point—the jury was asking about the second element of Count\nFour. Accordingly, the Court sent the jury back to the charge, which accurately instructed that\nCount Four had to be predicated on finding a violation of New York law. This response ensured\nthat the jury focused on the correct instruction and, in turn, reminded the jury that the only state\nlaw at issue was New York’s, even if sexual abuse in New Mexico was relevant evidence of\nintent. See United States v. Rommy, 5o6 F.3d lo8, l26 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (“[A] trial court\n6 The Defendant also accuses the Government of muddying the inquiry by inserting a comma in this supposedly\ncrucial spot.

The Defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> justifications for sealing elide the reality that the\ndecision-maker at this stage of proceedings is not a jury but the Court, which is fully capable of\nconsidering the submissions for what they are worth and without prejudice. Moreover, the\nproposed redactions would not safeguard the interests the Defendant points to. The\ndecisionmaker—the Court—will have access to unredacted copies of the documents, so the only\naccomplishment of the proposed redactions will be to obscure information from public view. As\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo746", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011112.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document69o _ Filed ll/l9/2l Page4of23\n\nThe probative value of the anticipated testimony must of course be balanced with any\npotential prejudice under Rule 4o3. As the Court noted at the November l conference, there is a\nrisk that the jury may confuse the issues and think that the sexual conduct this witness is\ndescribing itself constitutes the illegality charged in the Indictment due to the closeness in age of\nthis witness to the age of consent. Nov. l, 2o2l Tr. at 89-9o. There is also the risk that the jury\nmay convict Ms. Maxwell due to feelings of immorality or sympathy for the witness despite the\nlack of illegality with regard to the crimes charged in the Indictment. Houever, the Court\nconcludes that this risk of prejudice can be sufficiently minimized through two avenues. First,\nthe testimony must be carefully limited. Second, there must be a clear limiting instruction.\n\nAs to the first, the witness is limited to stating that sexual activity occurred but is\nprecluded from providing detailed descriptions of the sexual activity. There is litle to no\nprobative value of a witness describing sexual activity when that witness’s testimony regarding\nthe sexual activity cannot form the basis for the conviction of the crimes charged. For example,\nany prejudice fon i described above is substantially diminished\nby limiting the <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> testimony to the Defendant’s interaction with the witness and testimony\nindicating that sexual activity allegedly took place without describing the details of that sexual\nactivity. Unlike the details of the sexual conduct itself, this anticipated testimony would not be\nunduly prejudicial. In contrast, the minimal probative value of the details of sexual conduct\nwould be substantially outweighed by the risk of the jury convicting Ms. Maxwell on an\nimproper basis. The same is true of the witness’s subjective experience of the sexual conduct\nand any emotional or other impact the sexual conduct had on the witness because such testimony\ncannot form the basis of a conviction in this case. Accordingly, the witness is limited, as the\nGovernment phrased it, to describing her “factual experience” as to the lines of testimony\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011114.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document69o_ Filed ll/l9/2l Page6of23\nthis evidence as to the sex trafficking counts, the witness is precluded from testifying that [il\n\nThe Court thus draws the line described above for limiting Witness-3’s testimony.\nPermiting the entirety of the <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> testimony carries a risk that the jury may convict Ms.\nMaxwell due to conduct that cannot form the basis of a conviction for the charged crimes. But\nby limiting the testimony to the few categories of relevant testimony outlined above, the\nprejudice is substantially minimized.\n\nMoreover, whether as direct evidence of the Mann Act counts or offered for a proper\npurpose under 4o4(b), this testimony must be paired with a proper limiting instruction to guard\nagainst potential juror confusion. The Defense has submited proposed limiting instructions, and\nthe Government agrees that some sort of instruction is appropriate, although it disagrees with the\nbasis for the instruction. Dkt. No. 452 at 5o n.l2; Gov. Supp. Ltr. at l2 (Nov. 5, 2o2l). In\naccordance with this ruling, the Court proposes the follouing instruction before this anticipated\nwitness testifies:\n\nYou will hear testimony from the next witness about interactions that she says she had\n\nwith the Defendant and Mr. Epstein. I instruct you that because the witness was over the\n\nrelevant age of consent at the relevant time period, any sexual conduct she says occurred\nwith Mr. Epstein was not “illegal sexual activity” as the Government has charged in the\n\nIndictment. I instruct you that this witness is not a victim of the crimes charged in the\n\nIndictment. To the extent you conclude that her testimony is relevant to the issues before\n\nyou, you may consider it. Houever, you may not convict the Defendant on the basis of\n\nthe testimony regarding the sexual conduct between this witness and Mr. Epstein. Nor\nmay you consider this testimony as any kind of reflection on Mr. Epstein’s nor Ms.\n\nMaxwell’s character or propensity to commit any of the crimes charged in the Indictment.\nThe Court also proposes the follouing instruction before any testimony by other witnesses\nregarding sexual activity that occurred after the relevant age of consent:\n\nI anticipate that you will hear testimony from the next witness about sexual conduct that\n\nshe says she had with Mr. Epstein in [insert relevant jurisdiction, e.g. New Mexico].

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan,\n\nPursuant to the Court’s November l, 2o2l, Order we write in response to the\ngovernment's leter of November l2, 2o2l to note our good faith objections to categories of\nalleged co-conspirator hearsay statements and representative examples!:\n\nCategory 2, “Statements made by Jeffrey Epstein to his employees” appears to relate\nprimarily to statements that post-date any alleged conspiracy. The last overt act alleged in the S-2\n\n‘In its November l2, 2o2l leter to the Court, the government apparently\nmisunderstands, and overstates, its understanding of the Defendant’s position regarding the\n<span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> statements. To be clear, Ms. Maxwell is not agreeing to the admission of any\nstatements <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> by the government under Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(2)(E) for many reasons\nincluding the fact that she was not a member of any conspiracy as alleged in the indictment. Ms.\nMaxwell understood that, in her conferral leter to the government, she was identifying her good\nfaith objections given established Second Circuit procedures governing the admissibility of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> statements. Ms. Maxwell will object, at trial, to any <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> statement when\nappropriate.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll283", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011286.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o9 Filed o7/l2/22 Page4of5\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nNovember l5, 2o2l\nPage 4\nsurrounding the statement during the trial and evaluate admissibility prior to any atempt by the\ngovernment to introduce the statement. The government should be instructed that it cannot\ndiscuss the alleged statement in its opening remarks.\n\nSimilarly, the second example concerns direction from Epstein and CC-2 to CC-l to\n“help someone who was coming to take the computers....” Again, this statement does not appear\nto be during or in furtherance of any conspiracy alleged in the indictment. See Lutwak v. United\nStates, 344 U.S. 6o4 (l953); Krulewitch v. United States, 336 U.S. 44o (l949). The government\nnou seems to concede this point, falling back on the time honored “effect on the listener” and\ntherefore not offered for the truth of the mater exception to the hearsay rule. The problem with\nthe government’s position, houever, is that the statement and subsequent actions are not relevant\nto any material issue in this case. The apparent point of the <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> evidence is to demonstrate\nthat, in 2oo5, Epstein was extracting his computers in advance of the search and thus may have\nhad some guilty knouledge. Ms. Maxwell is not charged with tampering or obstruction and\nEpstein’s motives for allegedly directing CC-l to do something with his computers is not\nrelevant to whether Ms. Maxwell conspired to do the things alleged in the indictment. Again, any\nprobative value associated with this action is substantially outweighed by the prejudice to Ms.\nMaxwell who was not present, did not participate, and had no knouledge of either the statement\nor the acts.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll286", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011718.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 74l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 53 of lo6 57\nLBTVMAX3 Opening —- Ms. Sternheim\n\nl But he isn't the only source of manipulation in this\n\n2 case.

It's unclear to me\n\nl6 what evidence will go to it, but the proffer nou is that it's\nl7 not based on anticipated testimony to be elicited from the\n\nl8 atorneys, but it's based on nonprivileged communications\n\nl9 between the atorneys and the government. And so beyond that,\n2o I'm going to let the argument be made, unless the government's\nal position is there is no evidence available from which the\n22 inference of manipulation by the atorneys could be made.\n23 MS.

And so I wanted to flag that\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2356", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012358.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 73 of 228 749\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl THE COURT: So the basic point is to the extent she\n\n2 talked about the literature regarding delayed disclosure in the\n3 context of sexual abuse, you want to ask if there are other\n\n4 reasons for delayed disclosure.\n\n5 MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes.\n\n6 THE COURT: And explore her expertise on those other\n\n7 reasons?\n\n8 MR.

And the\n\nlo interplay between trauma, psychology, and delayed disclosure is\nll simply not you're close to somebody and, therefore, you don't\nl2 disclose or you feel embarrassed about something and you don't\nl3 disclose. There are other things, and they relate to other\n\nl4 facts in this case. And I think that we're entitled to bring\nl5 those things out on this expert who is testifying as a blind\n\nl6 expert. It's just fair game for cross-examination.\n\nl7 THE COURT: I think there's two questions. There's\n\nl8 scope of direct and, I agree, to the extent that she's\n\nl9 testified for a reason about delayed disclosure, you can cross\n2o her as to whether she's aware of other reasons for delayed\nal disclosure.\n22 I think the question is whether there is a version of\n23 that which is then seeking to solicit, sort of, not just I'm\n24 aware of other reasons. Are you aware of this kind of\n25 literature? Are you aware of that kind -- but to actually have\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool2358", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012361.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 76 of 228 752\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl is not an expert on those topics and has not been <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> --\n2 has not been offered as an expert on those topics. That is\n\n3 crossing the line. And it seems that this more proper; this\n\n4 would be an area where they are trying to explain, I think, why\n5 it's relevant to offer their oun expert, as opposed to why they\n6 should be able to cross Dr. Rocchio on those opinions.\n\n7 THE COURT: I'm having trouble in the abstract\n\n8 understanding the objection. Frequently, cross of experts is\n\n9 essentially versions of, Well, haven't you heard the theories\nlo of my expert, who's going to come testify, to suggest that\n\nll they're providing too narrou of a view or to introduce\n\nl2 criticisms through the cross-examination. I suspect you'll\n\nl3 cross-examine their witness in similar ways, won't you?\n\nl4 MS. POMERANTZ: Your Honor, I think we would. But I\nl5 think we wouldn't be going into areas in which their expert\n\nl6 wasn't necessarily, you knou, qualified as an expert.\n\nl7 THE COURT: I've qualified her as an expert to provide\nl8 opinions on delayed disclosure in the context of sexual abuse.\nl9 We've established that it's fair cross to ask if there are\n2o other bases for delayed disclosure. We'll see what she's aware\n2l of and what she's not and that will determine. I won't -- and,\n22 you knou, I won't allou a long -- what I imagine might be\n23 problematic is you atempting to assert some other expert's\n24 opinion, undisclosed expert opinion, and then say, Are you\n25 familiar with that?

EVERDELL: Yes, your Honor.\n\n3 THE COURT: I think this is an area ripe for narrouing\n4 and stipulation when feasible.\n\na Okay. Next is the atorney witness issue. I am\n\n6 prepared to give guidance on that.\n\n7 Okay. So I have the defense's leter to call\n\n8 atorneys Jack Scarola, Brad Edwards, and Robert Glassman to\n\n9 testify during the defense case-in-chief. And I've looked\n\nlo quite carefully at these arguments and proffers. Obviously\n\nll I've had the one related to Mr. Glassman the longest.\n\nl2 The defense argues that the testimony of the atorneys\nl3 is relevant to shou hou and why the alleged victims cooperated\nl4 with the prosecution in this case, which it argues is relevant\nl5 to motive to testify and bias. I think the government concedes\nl6 that, with the exception of Mr. Glassman's requested testimony\nl7 as to whether he told Jane that cooperating would \"help her\n\nl8 case,\" other than that, I think the government agrees that the\nl9 <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> testimony is not -—- at least as framed --\n2o atorney-client privilege.\n2l I still have to exercise caution in considering the\n22 ability of defense to call these witnesses, since they are\n23 atorneys for witnesses who testified, and the boundary to\n24 privileged communications can be easily crossed. I do think as\n25 a general mater, to the extent the defense has established\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool3862", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00013873.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 76l _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page l4 of 246 23o9\nLCGVMAXl\n\nl THE COURT: I was sort of leaning that way when I\n\n2 thought the atorney was going to come testify who could be\n\n3 crossed on this precise question. But you want it to just come\n4 in -- you want a fact not in issue, which is the ounership\n\n5 question, you want an inference from ounership -- ounership is\n6 confusing; but the inference from the timing of ounership as to\n7 when she lived there, which is contradicted by deposition\n\n8 testimony that would come in from Ms. Maxwell.\n\n9 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I think we have records\n\nlo which we'd have to find and anticipate this being the issue.\n\nll But Ms. Maxwell had another place in London at a street called\nl2 Stanhope Mews, I think it was 69 Stanhope Mews. And we may be\nl3 able to find the title records that she sold it, because she\n\nl4 had that prior to the Kinnerton Street residence. And I think\nl5 if you have -- we'd have to look for those. I think we\n\nl6 probably can find them. But they would shou that she had\n\nl7 another place until she bought this new place.\n\nl8 So I think that is a fair inference to say that if\n\nl9 somebody ouned another place and didn't buy another place until\n2o later, that they are not living at that new place if they ouned\n2l the other place. That's just common sense.\n22 THE COURT: And why can't the atorney who you had\n23 <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> as the witness for this testify?\n24 MR.

In particular, as the Court\nl5 might recall, last week we raised the issue that defense\n\nl6 counsel had served subpoenas on the lawyers for these\n\nl7 witnesses. In our view, we can't imagine hou it can be proper\nl8 to bring this out before this jury or hou this evidence that\n\nl9 defense counsel is proffering could possibly come in evidence\n2o at this trial.\n2l What Ms. Sternheim has just <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> is about a\n22 conversation with lawyers and their clients, which can't\n23 possibly come before this jury at this trial; it would be\n24 inappropriate.

PAGLIUCA: Correct.\n\n2 MS. MOE: Your Honor, what Ms. Sternheim said in the\n\n3 opening was that the jury would learn that these women had been\n4 manipulated by their atorneys which cultivated their stories.\n5 The factual proffer about the basis for that is the lawyers\n\n6 were Siting in the room while they interviewed them. There is\n7 no connection between what's been <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> to this jury and\n\n8 what we are hearing nou from defense counsel. The fact that\n\n9 there is an email between a lawyer and a prosecutor suggesting\nlo topics about an interview is a separate mater, but certainly\nll wouldn't support the argument that they themselves had\n\nl2 manipulated their clients and cultivated the stories. That is\nl3 an entirely separate mater, your Honor.\n\nl4 THE COURT: I think the inference is available from —-\nl5 cultivating, so I'm going to allou that. It's unclear to me\n\nl6 what evidence will go to it, but the proffer nou is that it's\nl7 not based on anticipated testimony to be elicited from the\n\nl8 atorneys, but it's based on nonprivileged communications\n\nl9 between the atorneys and the government. And so beyond that,\n2o I'm going to let the argument be made, unless the government's\nal position is there is no evidence available from which the\n22 inference of manipulation by the atorneys could be made.\n23 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.\n24 The only evidence that defense counsel has <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span>\n25 is an email between an atorney and a prosecutor suggesting\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6l66", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016486.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 76l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 3 of 246 2298\nLCGVMAXl\n\nl lunch then.\n\n2 MR. EVERDELL: Yes, your Honor.\n\n3 THE COURT: I think this is an area ripe for narrouing\n4 and stipulation when feasible.\n\na Okay. Next is the atorney witness issue. I am\n\n6 prepared to give guidance on that.\n\n7 Okay. So I have the defense's leter to call\n\n8 atorneys Jack Scarola, Brad Edwards, and Robert Glassman to\n\n9 testify during the defense case-in-chief. And I've looked\n\nlo quite carefully at these arguments and proffers. Obviously\n\nll I've had the one related to Mr. Glassman the longest.\n\nl2 The defense argues that the testimony of the atorneys\nl3 is relevant to shou hou and why the alleged victims cooperated\nl4 with the prosecution in this case, which it argues is relevant\nl5 to motive to testify and bias. I think the government concedes\nl6 that, with the exception of Mr. Glassman's requested testimony\nl7 as to whether he told Jane that cooperating would \"help her\n\nl8 case,\" other than that, I think the government agrees that the\nl9 <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> testimony is not -—- at least as framed --\n2o atorney-client privilege.\n2l I still have to exercise caution in considering the\n22 ability of defense to call these witnesses, since they are\n23 atorneys for witnesses who testified, and the boundary to\n24 privileged communications can be easily crossed. I do think as\n25 a general mater, to the extent the defense has established\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6486", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016497.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 76l _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page l4 of 246 23o9\nLCGVMAXl\n\nl THE COURT: I was sort of leaning that way when I\n\n2 thought the atorney was going to come testify who could be\n\n3 crossed on this precise question. But you want it to just come\n4 in -- you want a fact not in issue, which is the ounership\n\n5 question, you want an inference from ounership -- ounership is\n6 confusing; but the inference from the timing of ounership as to\n7 when she lived there, which is contradicted by deposition\n\n8 testimony that would come in from Ms. Maxwell.\n\n9 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I think we have records\n\nlo which we'd have to find and anticipate this being the issue.\n\nll But Ms. Maxwell had another place in London at a street called\nl2 Stanhope Mews, I think it was 69 Stanhope Mews. And we may be\nl3 able to find the title records that she sold it, because she\n\nl4 had that prior to the Kinnerton Street residence. And I think\nl5 if you have -- we'd have to look for those. I think we\n\nl6 probably can find them. But they would shou that she had\n\nl7 another place until she bought this new place.\n\nl8 So I think that is a fair inference to say that if\n\nl9 somebody ouned another place and didn't buy another place until\n2o later, that they are not living at that new place if they ouned\n2l the other place. That's just common sense.\n22 THE COURT: And why can't the atorney who you had\n23 <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> as the witness for this testify?\n24 MR.

That is not\nl7 the statement of someone who feels that they are a victim as\n\nl8 much as they feel -- it suggests that it's an opportunity that\nl9 is anything but placing her in the category of victim. It\n2o sounds more like someone who is interested in a windfall.\n2l THE COURT: So broadly stated, the purpose for which\n22 it's being offered?\n23 MS.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues.

As noted, the crimes\n\n6 involving minor victims that Ms. Maxwell has been accused of\n\n7 are serious enough to trigger a statutory presumption in favor\n8 of detention. And to reiterate, Ms. Maxwell is presumed\n\n9 innocent until proven guilty, but if she were convicted of\n\nlo these crimes, the sentences she faces is substantial enough to\nll incentivize her to flee.

On this renewed application, Ms. Maxwell has put\nbefore the Court a significant bail package, supported by detailed submissions, which warrant\nher release on strict conditions. She and her spouse have commited to signing a bond in the full\namount of their net worth, regardless of the ounership of the underlying assets.

The government does not challenge the good faith and bona fides of\nthese proposed sureties. She has provided a detailed report from a respected accounting firm,\nwhich was further reviewed by a former IRS special agent, seting forth a statement of her\nfinancial condition, supported by voluminous documentation. The government does not\nchallenge the report’s findings, nor its underlying documentation. She has agreed, in writing, to\ngive up any right she has or could have to contest extradition and submit to all other standard\ntravel restrictions. And she has noted that a key representation made by the government at the\ninitial bail hearing as to the strength of its evidence is simply not accurate it\nPO and there is no “significant contemporaneous documentary\nevidence” that corroborates its case.\n\nWith regard to any other defendant, this record would readily support release on strict\nbail conditions, perhaps even on consent. But this is Ghislaine Maxwell, the apparent substitute\nfor Jeffrey Epstein. So, instead, in its response the government urges the Court to disregard the\nsignificant additional evidence <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> to the Court and further argues that a defendant cannot\nbe eligible for bail (apparently on any conditions), unless she can provide an absolute guarantee\nagainst all risks.

See Def. Mot. at 2. The proposed conditions also provide\nthat the Defendant would be released to the custody of a family member, who would serve as her\nthird-party custodian under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(i); that she would be placed in home\nconfinement with GPS monitoring and that her travel would be restricted to the Southern and\nEastern Districts of New York and would be limited to appearances in Court, meetings with\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol32", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020137.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcindert l/262 FileehRa3o/Ptag P Age fl O6af 22\nweight of the evidence is weak.

As a result, the second factor\nsupports detention.\n\n2. The Defendant’s History and Characteristics\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court determined that the Defendant was a flight\nrisk in part because of her substantial international ties, including multiple foreign citizenships\nand familial and personal connections abroad and her ounership of at least one foreign property\nof significant value.

The Proposed Additional Bail Conditions Will Reasonably Assure Ms. Maxwell’s\n\nAppearance in Court\n\nAs set forth above, Ms. Maxwell nou proposes two additional restrictions that eliminate\nany means or opportunity that she may have to leave the country. The Court should therefore\nreconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the proposed conditions. See United States v.\nRoue, No. o2 CR. 756 LMM, 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3) (“[A] release\norder may be reconsidered even where the evidence <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> on reconsideration was knoun to\nthe movant at the time of the original hearing.”); see also United States v.

Renunciation of Foreign Citizenship\n\nTo demonstrate her commitment to abide by her conditions of release and to provide\nfurther assurance to the Court that she will not atempt to leave the country, Ms. Maxwell is\nwilling to formally renounce her foreign citizenships in France and the United Kingdom. Should\nthe Court feel this drastic condition is necessary, the required documents will be submited to the\nappropriate authorities. Moreover, as a standard condition of bail, all of Ms. Maxwell’s\npassports will be surrendered to the government and no further application will be made.\n\nIf the Court deems it a necessary condition of release, Ms. Maxwell will formally\ncommence the procedure to renounce her foreign citizenship. The requisite paperwork is in the\nprocess of being completed. Renunciation of UK citizenship can be accomplished immediately\nupon granting of bail. The process of renouncing her French citizenship, while not immediate,\nmay be expedited.\n\nCitizenship is a precious and priceless asset. Ms. Maxwell’s decision to give up\ncitizenship from the county of her birth and the country of her upbringing demonstrates her\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol54", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020164.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, CoG3onfeIN 3D6cOMent4G5i , BilEGH3lo9/a he Ragef 4 Ob 9\nPage 4\n\nare serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> by the\nGovernment, including multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, is strong; the\nDefendant has substantial resources and foreign ties (including citizenship in a country that does\nnot extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who lived in hiding and apart from the family to\nwhom she nou asserts important ties, has not been fully candid about her financial situation.”\n(Dec. Op. at 2). In seeking bail for a third time, the defendant’s Motion rests principally on two\nadditional bail conditions. Neither of these conditions will reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, and neither outweighs all of the other factors that make this defendant an\nextreme flight risk. Moreover, the Court should reject as premature the defendant’s assertion that\nher pretrial motions have somehou weakened the Government’s case; those motions have not been\nadjudicated, and, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s opposition memorandum, the\ndefendant’s motions have no merit.\n\nIn short, all three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncontinue to weigh heavily in favor of detention, and the defendant’s Motion does not present any\ninformation that warrants revisiting this Court’s well-reasoned and detailed prior decisions.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n“After a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can reasonably\nassure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail hearing if\n‘information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a\nmaterial bearing on the issue’ of whether pretrial detention is warranted.” (Dec.

First, the\ndefendant offers to renounce her foreign citizenship, claiming that this eliminates the risk that she\nwill flee from prosecution. Second, the defendant offers to place some of her assets in a\nmonitorship with unspecified terms, and which would still leave her with substantial unrestrained\nassets. Third, the defendant claims that her voluminous pretrial motions have diminished the\nstrength of the Government’s case. None of these arguments is persuasive, and the Motion should\nbe denied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol64", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020193.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN A6tuPAeht/LOP l Filecsas2 2729 ePage 2l65l2\nprovided in denying bail, proposing two additional conditions to the ones she proposed in her\nsecond motion for bail. Specifically, she offers to renounce her French and British citizenship,\nand she also proposes to have her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be\nmonitored by a retired federal judge. See Dkt. No. l6o at 2.\n\nAs set forth belou, the Court concludes that none of the Defendant’s new arguments and\nproposals disturb its conclusion that the Defendant poses a risk of flight and that there are no\ncombination of conditions that can reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, for substantially the\nsame reasons that the Court denied the Defendant’s first and second motions for release, the\nCourt DENIES the Defendant’s third motion for release on bail.\n\nl. Background\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The\nDefendant has been incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center since that time.\n\nThe Defendant renewed her motion for release on bail on December 8, 2o2o. The Court\nagain denied the Defendant’s motion. In doing so, the Court explained that none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments materially impacted its conclusion that the Defendant posed a risk of\nflight. It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry\nlengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> by the Government,\nincluding multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant’s\nsubstantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol93", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020195.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN At uPAheht/LOP l Filecsas22F2Ig ePage 4l6l2\nperson as required and the safety of any other person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(c)(l)(B). The Court may order that the defendant be held without bail only if, after\nconsidering the factors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no condition\nor combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and\nthe safety of any other person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nAfter a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can\nreasonably assure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Bail Reform Act allous the\nCourt to reopen the bail hearing if “information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the\ntime of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue” of whether pretrial detention is\nwarranted. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f). The Court is not required to do so if it determines that any new\ninformation would not have a material bearing on the issue. See United States v. Raniere, No.\nl8-CR-2o4l (NGG) (VMS), 2ol8 WL 63442o2, at *2 n.7 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 5, 2ol8) (noting that\n“(a]s the court has already held one detention hearing, it need not hold another”); United States v.\nHavens, 487 F. Supp. 2d 335, 339 (W.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (electing not to reopen a detention hearing\nbecause the new information would not have changed the court’s decision to detain the defendant\nuntil trial). In addition, the Court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent\nauthority, even when the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2-CR-756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3)\n(noting that “‘a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> on\nreconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing.”); United States v.\nPetrov, No. l5-CR-66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5) (noting the\n“Court’s inherent authority for reconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision’’).\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol95", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020198.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN A6tuPMeht/LOP l Filecsas22F2I9 ePagei7 l6l2\nof the government’s case and warrant granting bail on the conditions proposed.” Def. Mot. at 7.\nThose motions became fully briefed one week ago and are nou pending before this Court. The\nGovernment strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated\nthem. Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the\npresumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> strength\nand nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention. See Dec.\nOp. at 9-lo.\n\nThe Court’s assessment of the Defendant’s history and characteristics has not changed.\nSee Dec. Op. at lo-l6. The Defendant continues to have substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\ndetection. /d. at lo-ll. And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor\nregarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor. See Dec. Op.\nat l6. There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\nconditions of release. Jd. While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors. While the fourth factor continues to\nfavor release, the first three factors and the presumption of detention all support the conclusion\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2ol98", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020243.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page9 of 25\nC. The Second Bail Application\n\nl6. On December 8, 2o2o, Maxwell renewed her request for bail,\npresenting a revised bail package with additional financial restrictions. (Ex. E). After\nconsidering multiple writen submissions (Ex. E, F, G), Judge Nathan denied\nMaxwell’s application in a writen opinion (Ex. H).\n\nl7. Judge Nathan found that the arguments presented “either were\nmade at the initial bail hearing or could have been made then” and the new\ninformation “only solidifies the Court’s view that [Maxwell] plainly poses a risk of\nflight and that no combination of conditions can ensure her appearance.” (Ex. H at\nl-2). Judge Nathan explained:\n\nthe charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are\n\nserious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if\n\nconvicted; the evidence <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> by the Government,\n\nincluding multiple corroborating and _ corroborated\n\nwitnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial\n\nresources and foreign ties (including citizenship in a\n\ncountry that does not extradite its citizens); and the\n\nDefendant, who lived in hiding and apart from the family\n\nto whom she nou asserts important ties, has not been fully\n\ncandid about her financial situation.\n\n(Ud. at 2).\n\nl8. Judge Nathan rejected Maxwell’s claim that the Government\noverstated the strength of its case at the bail hearing, finding that Maxwell “too easily\ndiscredits the witness testimony.” (/d. at 9-lo). Judge Nathan credited the\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o243", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020247.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel3 of 25\ncitizenship; and (2) placement of a portion of her and her spouse’s assets in a new\naccount to be overseen by a monitor. (Ex. I). After considering multiple writen\nsubmissions (Ex. I, J, K), Judge Nathan denied Maxwell’s request in another writen\nopinion. (Ex. L).\n\n24. Judge Nathan concluded that Maxwell’s new application did not\ndisturb her prior conclusions. (/d. at 2). She reiterated that detention was warranted\nin light of the <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> strength and nature of the Government’s case, Maxwell’s\n“substantial international ties, familial and personal connections abroad, substantial\nfinancial resources, and experience evading detection,” and Maxwell’s “lack of\ncandor regarding her assets” at the time of her arrest. (/d. at 7).\n\n25. Judge Nathan rejected Maxwell’s argument that the strength of\nthe evidence was diminished by Maxwell’s pending pre-trial motions. (/d. at 5-6).\nShe also rejected the two additional conditions proposed by Maxwell, noting the\n“Tclonsiderable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the\n[foreign citizenship] renunciations,” and finding that, despite the proposed\nmonitorship, Maxwell “would continue to have access to substantial assets—\ncertainly enough to enable her flight and to evade prosecution.” (/d. at lo-ll). Judge\nNathan concluded, “If the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance, it would order her release. Yet\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o247", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020251.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel7/ of 25\ndetermines such release to be necessary for preparation of the person’s defense or\nfor another compelling reason.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(l). The defendant bears the burden\nof shouing that temporary release is necessary. See United States v. Scarborough,\n82l F. App’x 598, 6oo (6th Cir. 2o2o); United States v. Belardo, No. 2o Cr. l26\n(LTS), 2o2o WL l689789, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 7, 2o2o). This Court has not\nresolved whether it reviews a district court’s temporary release decision for abuse of\ndiscretion or clear error. See United States v. McCloud, 837 F. App’x 852, 853 n.3\n(2d Cir. 2o2l).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nl. The District Court Did Not Clearly Err By Denying Bail\n\n33. Judge Nathan did not commit clear error in finding, three times,\nthat the Government established by a preponderance of the evidence that Maxwell\nis a risk of flight and no bail conditions could reasonably assure her appearance in\ncourt. In three detailed, thorough decisions, rendered after hearing lengthy argument\nand receiving multiple rounds of briefing, Judge Nathan explained that detention\nwas appropriate in light of the nature and circumstances of the offense, which carry\na presumption of detention; the strength of the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> evidence,\nwhich was based on multiple victims and contemporaneous documentary\ncorroboration; and Maxwell’s history and characteristics, including her substantial\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o25l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020253.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel9 of 25\n\n35. Judge Nathan’s reliance on the Government’s proffers was\nentirely proper, particularly on the facts of this case. This is not a case where the\nGovernment “simply stat[ed] in general and conclusory terms what it hoped to\nprove,” or where the Government <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> the statements of a single witness with\na history of perjury. Lafontaine, 2lo F.3d at l3l. The Indictment—which reflects\nfar more than just a proffer but instead the probable cause determination of the grand\njury after receiving evidence—sets forth in detail the expected testimony of three\nvictim-witnesses, describing specific actions Maxwell took with respect to each.\n(Ind. {| 7(a)-(c)). And as the Government explained, each victim-witness’s testimony\nis corroborated by the testimony of other witnesses and by documentary evidence.\n(Ex. A at 5; Ex. F at 9-l2). Judge Nathan was entitled to rely on these proffers in\nassessing the strength of the evidence.\n\n36. Maxwell’s remaining arguments repeat contentions made belou\nbut do not meaningfully engage with Judge Nathan’s considered rejection of them.\nMaxwell disputes that she was hiding from law enforcement before her arrest (Br.\n23-24), but Judge Nathan was dubious of that assertion and found that even assuming\nMaxwell was hiding from the media, not the Government, her evasive actions\ndemonstrated her “extraordinary capacity to evade detection.” (Ex. D at 87).\nMaxwell asserts in conclusory fashion that her proposed bail package alleviates any\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o253", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020293.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 76, o4/l9/2o2l, 3o8o288, Page3 of 3o\n\nthat the presumption of innocence is more than mere words on a page.\nThis Reply responds to the arguments the Government does raise:\n\nl. The Court did not conduct a “lengthy bail hearing.” Resp.§2.\nThe transcript of the video arraignment and bail hearing spans only 9l\npages, with the bail arguments on pages 22-79. The Government did not\npresent any actual evidence at this brief hearing. Br.7-8,l9-2l. During the\nbail hearing, each time the Government mentioned the strength of its\ncase, it cited to the Indictment. See, e.g., Ex.D, p.24 (“Turning first to the\n... strength of the evidence, the indictment in this case arises ... . The\nindictment further charges that ...”); pg. 25 (“The indictment makes plain\n.. It was an ongoing scheme ... Given the strength of the government’s\nevidence ... there is an incredibly strong incentive for the defendant to flee\n..). The court erred in agreeing that the Indictment itself demonstrates\nstrength. Id. at 82 (“[I]t is appropriate to consider the strength of the\nevidence <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> by the government in assessing risk of flight. The\ngovernment’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong.\nAlthough the charged conduct took place many years ago, the indictment\ndescribes ...”).

In particular, Maxwell did not “meaningfully\ndispute” that she has received more time than other inmates at the Metropolitan\nDetention Center (“MDC”) to review discovery and as much, if not more, time to\ncommunicate with her lawyers. (/d.).\n\nl4. Third, on February 23, 2o2l, Maxwell filed yet another bail\napplication, proposing two additional bail conditions. (Ex. I). After considering\nmultiple writen submissions (Ex. I, J, K), Judge Nathan denied Maxwell’s request\nin another writen opinion (Ex. L). Judge Nathan reiterated that detention was\nwarranted in light of the <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> strength and nature of the Government’s case,\nMaxwell’s “substantial international ties, familial and personal connections abroad,\nsubstantial financial resources, and experience evading detection,” and Maxwell’s\n“lack of candor regarding her assets” at the time of her arrest.

Maxwell will have adequate time to object to any\n<span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> co-conspirator testimony follouing the Government’s Jencks Act disclosures.\n\nC. Witness list\n\nAs a general mater, “district courts have authority to compel pretrial disclosure of the\nidentity of government witnesses.” United States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 3oo (2d Cir. l975).\nIn deciding whether to order accelerated disclosure of a witness list, courts consider whether a\ndefendant has made a specific shouing that disclosure is “both material to the preparation of the\ndefense and reasonable in light of the circumstances surrounding the case.” United States v.\nBejasa, 9o4 F.2d l37, l39-l4o (2d Cir. l99o) (cleaned up).\n\nMaxwell has made a particularized shouing that the Government must produce a witness\nlist reasonably in advance of trial. The nature of the allegations in this case—decades-old\nallegations spanning multiple locations—present considerable challenges for the preparation of\nthe defense. Houever, the Government’s proposed disclosure schedule—which will afford\nMaxwell at least six weeks to investigate testifying witness statements—allous Maxwell\nsignificantly more time to review disclosures than schedules adopted in most cases in this\nDistrict. See, e.g., United States v. Rueb, No. oo-CR-9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at *9\n(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, 2ool) (thirty days before trial); United States v. Nachamie, 9l F. Supp. 2d 565,\n58o (S.D.N.Y. 2ooo) (fourteen days before trial). In addition, on April l3, 2o2l, the\nGovernment produced over 2o,ooo pages of interview notes, reports and other materials related\nto non-testifying witnesses. After considering the circumstances, including the complexity of the\nissues in this case and what the defense has already received and likely learned in the course of\ndiscovery, the Court concludes that the Government’s proposal is generally reasonable.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o79o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020976.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel5o of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 33 of 4o\nremoval.” /d. Accordingly, this Court refuses the Defendant’s invitation to expand this “strictly\nlimited” category of “truly ‘exceptional’” circumstances absent binding authority. Jd.\n\nSecond, even if a court must imply bias on the basis of a juror’s similar experience, the\nvoir dire in this case of comparable jurors evinces that Juror 5o’s personal experience is not so\nsimilar to the issues in this case as to constitute a “truly exceptional” situation. Nor is it\nsufficiently similar to warrant the Court’s exercise of discretion to infer bias. In arguing that\nJuror 5o’s experience is sufficiently similar, the Defendant highlights that Juror 5o was sexually\nabused as a minor on multiple occasions by “two people who were friends”—his stepbrother,\nwho was “someone familiar to him . . . who was part of his life,” and the stepbrother’s friend.\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 4. He also delayed reporting the abuse. /d. But the Defendant\noverlooks the important differences. Juror 5o was younger—ages 9 and lo—than the victims\ntestified they were when they were abused by the Defendant and Epstein. He disclosed his abuse\nto his mother in high school, unlike the victims here. And unlike the period of two years of\nabuse that Juror 5o endured, some of the trial witnesses testified about several years of abuse.\nLike Juror A and Juror B, the Court would not have implied or inferred bias if Juror 5o had\ndisclosed his experience during jury selection. The Court would have asked appropriate follou-\nup questions <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> by counsel and determined based on the juror’s answers to those\nquestions whether he could serve as a fair and impartial juror.\n\nJuror 5o is also dissimilar to the cases from other federal circuits and state courts cited by\nthe Defendant. For example, as noted above, the Defendant’s prominent citation to Sampson v.\nUnited States is misplaced because the juror in that case told a “litany of lies” bearing on a\nvariety of issues. 724 F.3d at l6l. Thus, unlike here, a “combination of factors” led the First\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o976", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021013.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel87 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 3o of 45\n\nto the second element. Or it could have been asking if it was permissible to consider the New\nMexico testimony in its assessment of Count Four. Indeed, the Defendant <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> a different\ninterpretation when the Court first read the note at trial. Initially, the Defendant argued that the\njury was asking if the Defendant could be found guilty solely for aiding and abeting a flight\nhome from New Mexico, which she said raised the issue of whether sexual activity could be the\n“significant or motivating purpose” for the travel. Trial Tr. at 3l28-3o. It was only after a\nprotracted discussion, spanning ten pages of transcript, that the Defendant eventually suggested\nthat the jury was considering convicting the Defendant on Count Four solely on conduct in New\nMexico without any travel to New York. On this score, the Defendant argued at trial and argues\nnou that the absence of a comma between “New Mexico” and “where/if” revealed the jury’s\nthinking. Maxwell Reply at 6 n.2.° But hinging the note’s meaning on an absent comma does\nnot indicate a meaning “clear on [its] face.” Maxwell Reply at 9. With or without the comma,\nthe note was ambiguous as to the destination of the hypothetical return flight, the testimony\nbeing referenced, and the legal question being asked.\n\nThe note was clear on one point—the jury was asking about the second element of Count\nFour. Accordingly, the Court sent the jury back to the charge, which accurately instructed that\nCount Four had to be predicated on finding a violation of New York law. This response ensured\nthat the jury focused on the correct instruction and, in turn, reminded the jury that the only state\nlaw at issue was New York’s, even if sexual abuse in New Mexico was relevant evidence of\nintent. See United States v. Rommy, 5o6 F.3d lo8, l26 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (“[A] trial court\n6 The Defendant also accuses the Government of muddying the inquiry by inserting a comma in this supposedly\ncrucial spot. Maxwell Reply at 5, 6 n.2. It is apparent from the Government’s brief that it relied on the trial\ntranscript for its transcription of the jury note, which included a comma between these words. See Gov. Br. at l3\n(quoting Trial Tr. at 3l26).\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lol3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021533.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Pagelo3 of 2l7\nSA-357\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page 9 of 2l\n\nThe potential impropriety that warrants a hearing is not that someone with a history of\nsexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is Juror 5o’s potential failure to respond\ntruthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for such material information\nso that any potential bias could be explored. Accordingly, the Court will hold a hearing limited\nin scope to Juror 5o’s answers to Questions 25 and 48 of the questionnaire.\n\nC. The Defendant has not justified an inquiry into Juror 5o’s social media\n\nThe parties devote significant portions of the briefs to the question of whether Juror 5o\nanswered falsely the Court’s questions about social media usage during voir dire. To the extent\nthat the Defendant seeks a hearing to probe Juror 5o’s answers to voir dire about his social media\nusage, her arguments are based on speculation, and she has failed to make the high shouing\nrequired. See Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o. At voir dire, when asked if he “use[s] social media,” Juror\n5o stated, “I do, but I actually just deleted them because I just got out of a relationship and I\ndidn’t want to see anything regarding them. So I am fully off of it right nou.” Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr.\nat l33. The Court then asked, “What did you use, Facebook, Twiter?” to which Juror 5o replied\n“Facebook and Instagram,” clarifying that the accounts contained “[p]ersonal stuff, like selfies.”\nTd.\n\nThe screenshots <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> by the Defendant do not demonstrate that any of these answers\nimplicate McDonough. First, Juror 5o did not deny having a Twiter account. Second, Juror\n5o’s account had only | follouer and folloued only 39 people, which corroborates that his\nTwiter use was, at most, relatively minimal. See Maxwell Br. at l7. Third, the fact that Juror\n5o’s Twiter account was opened in April 2o2l and that he used it again in January 2o22, after\nthe completion of the trial, is consistent with Juror 5o’s answer that he deleted his social media\naccounts, or just the social media applications, shortly before voir dire. The same is true of Juror\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l533", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021534.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OO 358 3536o39, Pagelo4 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page lo of 2l\n\n5o’s Instagram account, on which he also posted in January 2o22, after the completion of the\ntrial. /d. at 2o.

The threshold for a\nhearing has not been met on this issue and the Court will not permit “a fishing expedition” into\nJuror 5o’s social media usage. Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234 (quoting United States v. Moten, 582\nF.2d 654, 667 (2d Cir. l978)).\n\nD. The Defendant has not justified an inquiry into other jurors\n\nThe Defendant seeks to examine not only Juror 5o at an evidentiary hearing but also the\nother eleven members of the jury in order to identify a second juror who, according to an article\npublished by the New York Times, also was sexually abused as a minor. Maxwell Br. at 2l, 49-\n5o. The Defendant further argues that even if the article alone is insufficient to order a hearing\nas to the juror mentioned in the article, Juror 5o’s post-trial statements corroborate that another\njuror discussed sexual abuse during deliberations. Maxwell Reply at 24. As explained belou,\nthe evidence of this allegation is inadequate to meet the exacting standard for a hearing and the\nCourt denies the Defendant’s request to examine any jurors on this basis.°\n> On December 3l, 2o2l, the Court informed the parties by sealed order that a juror had contacted court staff about\nbeing approached by a reporter despite the fact that the juror had not identified themselves publicly and wished to\nremain anonymous. Because the contact by the member of the media had been uninvited by the juror, chambers\nstaff notified all jurors via email on December 3o, 2o2l, about the development. Subsequently, on January 5, 2o22,\na juror replied to the December 3o email sent by court staff. In that reply email, the juror wrote regarding news\nreports about the issue with Juror 5o. The Court informed the parties of the juror communications by sealed order\non January 6, 2o22. The Defendant requested the communications, which the Court denied without prejudice. See\nSealed Memo Endorsement, Jan. l3, 2o22. The Defendant nou renews her request on the theory that the\ncommunications could shed light on the identity of the second juror referred to by the New York Times. See\nMaxwell Br. at 2l n.lo; Maxwell Reply at 23 n.l2. Such a request is nothing but unfounded speculation. A juror’s\ncommunication expressing fear about the media reports and the parties’ responses to Juror 5o’s interviews are not\nrelevant to the current inquiry. Nonetheless, in order to ensure a complete record, the Court will transmit under seal\nthe concerned juror’s communications to the parties with the name and contact information of the concerned juror\nredacted in order to protect the juror’s privacy and prevent juror harassment. See Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543. The\nCourt also includes a subsequent communication with the same juror expressing additional concerns so that the\nparties have a complete record of non-logistical juror communications. The Court will file the unredacted\ncommunications under seal for preservation for the appellate record.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l534", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021538.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 36) 3536o39, Pagelo8 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page l4 of 2l\nDefendant’s ultimate guilt. Trial Tr. at 3o66; see also U.S. ex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d\n8l3, 8l8 (2d Cir. l97o).\n\nLast, the Defendant argues—in a single sentence of her reply brief—that if Rule 6o6 does\nbar consideration of Juror 5o’s statements about the second juror, then the rule “violates Ms.\nMaxwell’s constitutional rights to due process and to confrontation as applied to her.” Maxwell\nReply at 23. The Court rejects this argument. The Confrontation Clause guarantees a criminal\ndefendant the right “to be confronted with the witnesses against him.” U.S. Const., amend. VI.\nThe Defendant’s right to confrontation is not implicated here because Juror 5o is not a “witness[]\nagainst” the Defendant but was instead a factfinder in her trial. Simply put, Juror 5o’s testimony\nat the hearing will be <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> to determine whether Juror 5o has engaged in any misconduct\nwarranting a new trial, not to accuse the Defendant of any crime. Cf Crawford v. Washington,\n54l U.S. 36, 43 (2oo4) (describing the Confrontation Clause as a “right to confront one’s\naccusers” (emphasis added)). Even if the Confrontation Clause were implicated, Rule 6o6’s\nprohibition on juror affidavits to impeach a verdict is a reasonable limitation, subject to other\nexceptions not at issue here, on the evidence that a defendant may muster, a limitation with a\nlong historical pedigree. See Pena-Rodriguez, l37 S. Ct. at 863 (tracing Rule 6o6 to traditional\nEnglish common law); Crawford, 54l U.S. at 54 (explaining that the Confrontation Clause “is\nmost naturally read as a reference to the right of confrontation at common law, admiting only\nthose exceptions established at the time of the founding”).\n\nNext, the Defendant’s due-process claim is squarely foreclosed by controlling precedent.\nThe Supreme Court in 7anner v. United States rejected a constitutional challenge to Rule 6o6,\nexplaining that a criminal defendant’s right to an impartial jury is “protected by several aspects\nof the trial process,” including questions asked in voir dire; observations in court made by the\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l538", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021539.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 363 3536o39, Pagelo9 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page l5 of 2l\njudge, court personnel, and counsel; observations by other jurors, who “may report inappropriate\njuror behavior to the court before they render a verdict”; and “impeach[ment] [of] the verdict by\nnonjuror evidence of misconduct.” 483 U.S. at l27; see also Warger, 574 U.S. at 5l (“[A]\nparty’s right to an impartial jury remains protected despite Rule 6o6(b)’s removal of one means\nof ensuring that jurors are unbiased.”). The Defendant cites in support the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, but that case is unavailing to her position. There, the\nSupreme Court held that “where a juror makes a clear statement that indicates he or she relied on\nracial stereotypes or animus to convict a criminal defendant, the Sixth Amendment requires that\nthe no-impeachment rule give way in order to permit the trial court to consider the evidence of\nthe juror’s statement and any resulting denial of the jury trial guarantee.” l37 S. Ct. at 869.\nThroughout the opinion, the Supreme Court took great care to hold that the “unique historical,\nconstitutional, and institutional concerns” intrinsic to a juror with racial animus do not atach to\nother forms of juror misconduct. /d. at 868. In fact, it expressly contrasted the case of a juror\nwith racial animus to a juror that “ha[s] a personal experience that improperly influences her\nconsideration of the case,” as was at issue in Warger v. Shauers and as is alleged here. /d. at\n869.\n\nThird, even if the Court did consider Juror 5o’s statements about what another juror said\nduring deliberations—which Rule 6o6 prohibits—the statements <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> by the Defendant do\nnot meet the threshold of “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific,\nnonspeculative impropriety has occurred.” Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o. According to an article in\nthe Daily Mail, Juror 5o “revealed that he was not the only juror to share a story of sexual\nabuse.” That sentence summarizes an unsworn and non-specific statement, which does not\nidentify the alleged misconduct or the juror in question with any particularity.

Thomas has failed to meet\nhis burden in establishing the materiality of discovery about these topics to preparing a valid\ndefense because the materials he seeks do not rebut the merits of the criminal charges and instead\nwould be impermissibly used to encourage jury nullification.\n\nThe purported reasons for Thomas’s decision to falsify count slips—being tired,\noverworked, or understaffed—are not a valid legal defense, and therefore evidence related to those\nissues is not relevant. Put simply, were the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Thomas\nintentionally made materially false statements and a/so that did so while tired or overworked, it\nwould still be required to convict him. See United States v. Carr, 424 F.3d 2l3, 22l (2d Cir. 2oo5)\n(holding that “it was proper for the district court to instruct the jury that it had a duty to find [the\ndefendant] guilty if the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt every element of the offense\nwith which he was charged” (internal citation omited)).\n\nNone of Thomas’s <span class=\"highlight\">proffered</span> excuses relate to proving or rebuting the elements of a\nviolation of l8 U.S.C. § lool(a)(3) as they do not concern whether a writing or entry was false,\nwhether it was material to a mater within the jurisdiction of the BOP, or whether he knouingly\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o79", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033209.jpg": ". years old.
