Second, she must make a\nsubstantial preliminary shouing that Judge McMahon would have denied the Government’s\napplication absent any such misrepresentation. The Court finds that Maxwell has not made a\nsubstantial preliminary shouing on either prong.\n\nMaxwell’s argument here centers on the Government’s statements to Judge McMahon\nduring the second proceeding on April 9, 2ol9, concerning its application to modify the\nprotective order. At that proceeding, Judge McMahon explained that she wanted to make sure\nthe Government’s request did not present a similar situation to that in Chemical Bank v.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Affiliated</span> FM Ins. Co., l54 F.R.D. 9l (S.D.N.Y. l994), where a party in civil litigation urged\nprosecutors to instigate a criminal investigation and then provided confidential documents in\nviolation of a protective order. To that end, she asked the Government to explain “contacts\nbetween the United States Atorney’s Office and the Boies Schiller firm prior to the issuance of\nthe subpoena on the subject of your investigation.” The prosecutor at that hearing informed\nJudge McMahon about all communications between the U.S. Atorney’s Office and BSF after\nthe current investigation began—namely, that the Government told the firm that it intended to\nmake a document request and that the firm told the Government that some of the materials were\nsubject to a protective order. Although the prosecutor was included on an email several months\nearlier from the AUSA who met with Giuffre’s atorneys in 2ol6, he did not inform Judge\nMcMahon about any communications with BSF before the current investigation began.\n\nMaxwell has not made a substantial preliminary shouing that the Government’s\nstatement was a deliberate or reckless misrepresentation. The AUSA could reasonably have\nunderstood Judge McMahon’s question to concern only communications about the\nGovernment’s current investigation.

But the Protective\nOrder in this case is at least arguably not temporary or limited. It would have expired had the |\ncase gone to trial, but, as the case setled, it appears to me to bind the parties permanently. It is |\ntrue that nothing in the Protective Order seems to prevent either Giuffre or Maxwell from |\nmaking public documents that were designated confidential by that party once the lawsuit is |\nover. Houever, as to documents designated confidential by the other party, the promise of |\nconfidentiality plainly survives termination of the lawsuit—even to the point of requiring that :\nthose materials be returned or destroyed. ;\nThird, the Government argues that applying Martindell to its application here “would risk |\nrendering | Martindell] in even further conflict with the well-reasoned decisions of numerous |\nother Circuits,” (Gov’t Leter Br. at 5 n.3.) Martindell is indeed an outlier; every other Circuit |\n|\nthat has considered the clash between protective orders and grand jury subpoenas has questioned |\nits wisdom and has come up with a standard more favorable to the Government’s position.

Co., l54 F.R.D. 9l (S.D.N.Y. l994), |\nLike this case, Chemical Bank arose in a somewhat unusual posture: a party to a protective order |\nunilaterally approached the Manhatan District Atorney’s Office, “suggesting that it had :\nevidence of criminal violations relating to the case.” Jd. at 93.
