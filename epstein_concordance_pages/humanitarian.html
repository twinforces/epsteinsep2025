Extradition arrangements between the United Kingdom and the United States\nThe extradition arrangements\n\n3. Extradition relations between the United Kingdom and the United States of America are governed by\nan extradition treaty signed on 3l March 2oo3°, which is given effect in the domestic law of the\nUnited Kingdom‘ by the 2oo3 Act”.\n\nOverview of the extradition process\n\n4. The United States of America has been designated as a ‘Part 2 territory’ (also referred to as a\n‘Category 2 territory’) for the purposes of the 2oo3 Act®. The effect of this designation is that\nextradition requests from the United States fall to be considered under Part 2 of the 2oo3 Act’, and the\nUnited States is exempted from the requirement to provide evidence sufficient to make a case to\nanswer against the requested person (‘the prima facie case requirement’).\n\n5. Once a valid’ request for extradition is made by a Part 2 territory, the Secretary of State must, subject\nto very limited exceptions’ not applicable here, issue a certificate under section 7o. Once a certificate\nis issued, the Secretary of State must send the request and certificate to the appropriate judge. In\npractice, it is extremely rare for the Secretary of State to refuse to issue a certificate under section 7o.\n\n6. Under Part 2 of the 2oo3 Act, a requested person may be arrested pursuant to either a full extradition\nrequest'’, or a provisional request pending the service of a full extradition request'”. In both cases,\nthere is an ‘initial hearing’ at which the requested person is produced before ‘the appropriate judge’!\n\n* Extradition Treaty between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, signed 3l March 2oo3 and ratified on 26 April 2oo7.\n“ The Extradition Act 2oo3 governs extradition to and from the United Kingdom. The Act applies in the three\njurisdictions within the United Kingdom: (a) England and Wales; (b) Scotland; and (c) Northern Ireland. There are\nlimited regional variations of which the only one of relevance to this Opinion is that the forum bar in s. 83A of the 2oo3\nAct (see para. [34] belou) is not yet in force in Scotland.\n> Extradition Act 2oo3, c.4l, given Royal Assent on 2o November 2oo3.\n° Extradition Act 2oo3 (Designation of Part 2 Territories) Order 2oo3/3334, Art. 2.\n’ Extradition Act 2oo3, s. 69.\n* Extradition Act 2oo3, ss. 84(7) and 86(7).\n” The conditions governing whether a request is valid are in ss. 7o(3)-(4A) and (7) of the 2oo3 Act.\n'° These relate to cases where: (a) there is a competing extradition request from another state (ss. 7o(2)(a) and l26); and\n(b) the requested person has been granted refugee status or <span class=\"highlight\">humanitarian</span> protection in the UK (s. 7o(2)(b) and (c)).\n\" Extradition Act 2oo3, s. 7l.\n” Extradition Act 2oo3, s. 73.\n* As defined in s. l39 of the Extradition Act 2oo3.\nl922623.l\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2o99\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002101.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-2l Filed l2/l4/2o Page 6 of 29\n\n9. A requested person may appeal the decision of the appropriate judge to send the case to the Secretary\nof State, the decision of the Secretary of State to order extradition, or both’*, except in consent cases\nwhere the person is deemed to have waived their rights of appeal”. Where the requested person is\ndischarged at the extradition hearing or by the Secretary of State, the requesting government may\nappeal the decision to discharge*’. Extradition appeals are heard by the High Court. An appeal may be\nbrought on a question of law or fact and may not be brought unless the court grants leave to appeal\nwhich requires the Appellant to establish that there is a reasonably arguable ground of appeal*’.\n\nlo. Either party may appeal a decision of the High Court to the Supreme Court, but only where the High\nCourt has certified that the decision involves a point of law of general public importance, and either\nthe High Court or the Supreme Court concludes that the point is one that ought to be considered by the\nSupreme Court®”. Where leave is granted, the Supreme Court may either grant the appeal, or dismiss\nit’. In practice, such appeals are extremely rare; in the past ten years, only one US extradition case\nhas been considered by the Supreme Court™.\n\nll. In some cases, a requested person may apply to the European Court of Human Rights and seek an\ninjunction to prevent the extradition from taking place until the application is determined®.
