The draft\nNPA contained the terms presented to the defense team on July 3l, 2oo7, and called for Epstein to\nenter a state plea by September 28, 2oo7.

This was Acosta’s\nfirst meeting with Epstein’s defense team. Villafafia understood the purpose of this meeting was\nto afford Epstein’s counsel an opportunity to “make a pitch” as to why the case should not be\nprosecuted federally. Villafafia recalled that at a “pre-meet” before defense counsel arrived,\nAcosta did not express concern about the viability of the prosecution or the strength of the case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that the meeting was not “‘a negotiation,” but a chance for the defense to\npresent their arguments, which were made by Starr and focused primarily on federalism. Villafafia\nsimilarly recalled that the meeting mainly consisted of the defense argument that the Epstein case\nshould remain a state mater in which the USAO should not interfere. Both Villafafia and her\nco-counsel recalled that Starr addressed himself directly to Acosta, and that Starr, who had held\nSenate-confirmed positions in the government, commented to Acosta that he and Acosta were “the\nonly people in this room who have run the [gantlet] of confirmation by the Senate.” Acosta did\nnot recall the comment, but he told OPR, “[B]Jack in July, we had decided that we were going\nChapter Three, the Department’s position at the time was that victim consultation was not required in maters in which\nthe government did not pursue a federal charge.

Mr. Epstein was\nfortunate to have such excellent representation.”\n\nVIII. POST-NPA NEGOTIATIONS\n\nAlmost immediately after the NPA was signed, conflicts arose about its terms, and the\ndifficult negotiation process began anew. The USAO quickly realized that there were numerous\nissues concerning the monetary damages provision that were not resolved in the NPA, and the\nparties differed in their interpretations of the § 2255 provision, in particular the role and duties of\nthe atorney representative for the victims. As negotiations regarding the damages provision\ncontinued, the defense was able to delay having Epstein enter his guilty plea in state court.\n\nA. September — October 2oo7: Sloman’s Concerns about Selection of an\n\nAtorney Representative Lead to a Proposed NPA Addendum\n\nThe first controversy centered on the appointment of an atorney representative for the\nvictims. Initially, Villafafia reached out to a private atorney who was one of several suggested to\nher for that role. Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that she was recommending the atorney to serve as\nthe victims’ representative and suggested a phone conference to discuss what information the\nUSAO could disclose to the atorney about the case. Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she had never\nmet the atorney, but he had been recommended by “a good friend in our appellate section” and by\none of the district judges in Miami.'** Over the next few days, Villafafia exchanged messages with\nthe atorney about the possibility of his serving as the atorney representative. She also exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, passing along procedural questions raised by the atorney.\n\nBy this time, Lourie had fully transitioned to his detail at the Department’s Criminal\nDivision. Sloman, who had been on vacation during the week the NPA was finalized, returned to\nthe office, reviewed the final agreement, and immediately expressed his disapproval of the\nprovision authorizing the USAO to select an atorney representative for the victims, which he\nbelieved might raise the appearance of a conflict of interest. Instead, he proposed that a special\nmaster make the selection. Although evidently frustrated by Sloman’s belated proposal, Villafafia\nconveyed to Lefkouitz the suggestion that a special master be appointed to select the atorney\nrepresentative, rather than having the USAO make the selection.'°° She provided Lefkouitz with\nprobe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge, with the\nunderstanding that he will do prison time.” Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For\nTeen Sex Massages,” New York Post, Oct. l, 2oo7.

The defense subsequently raised this as a\nmisconduct issue, alleging that Villafafia was “closely associated” with the individual nominated for the victims’\nrepresentative position.\n\nl35 In a separate email to the proposed atorney representative, Villafafia commented, “[O]f course they tell me\nthis nou.”\n87\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3289", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003369.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l93 of 348\nVillafafia had raised (defense counsel’s atempt to insert an immigration waiver into the\nagreement), but Lourie did not comment on the provision promising not to prosecute co-\nconspirators or ask Villafafia to explain why she believed the provision did not harm the\ngovernment’s interests. In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“TaJny other thoughts,” but there is no indication that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.** Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.”*°? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.”4! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of . . . the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n29 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\nAAO The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstetn’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\n24l Villafafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3369", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003387.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ll of 348\nmanagers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.”*’\n\nSecond, key personnel were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the... bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third\nad In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3387", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003407.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23l of 348\nChief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.”?! Sloman forwarded this\nemail to Acosta. Villafafia recalled that Sloman responded to her email by telephone, possibly\nafter he had spoken to Acosta, and stated, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.” Villafafia did not recall\nSloman explaining at the time the reason for that instruction.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[WJe’ve\nbeen advised that . . . pre-charge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Sloman did not\nrecall any discussions, before the NPA was signed, about contacting the victims or conferring with\nthem regarding the potential resolution of the case. Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that\nwe had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek\napproval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the notification issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.”” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”?”°\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.””* Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate\n22) Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “he was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\n\n282 Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\ni The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n2o4 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto .. . instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003487.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3ll of 348\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into\nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation\nwithout a federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department\ndid not interpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the\nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before\ncriminal charges were brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation\nwas for the purpose of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series\nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of\nthe government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is\ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims\nof a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\n285\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3487", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004310.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l3 of 349\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA.

In early 2oo4, Sloman was appointed\nChief of the USAO’s Criminal Division. In October 2oo6, Sloman became the FAUSA, and\nSloman’s office was located with Acosta’s in the Miami office’s executive suite.\n\nAs FAUSA, Sloman was responsible for supervising the Civil, Criminal, and Appellate\nDivisions, and he was part of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein investigation.\nAlthough Sloman had relatively litle involvement in the decisions and negotiations that led to the\nNPA and did not review it before it was signed, he personally negotiated an addendum to the NPA,\nwhich he signed on behalf of the USAO in October 2oo7. After subordinates Mathew Menchel\nand Andrew Lourie left the USAO, Sloman directly engaged with the line AUSA, Marie Villafafia,\non Epstein maters, and participated in meetings and other communications with defense counsel.\nAfter Acosta was formally recused from the Epstein mater in December 2oo8, Sloman became\nthe senior USAO official supervising the mater. When Acosta left the USAO, Sloman became\nthe Acting U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida, and in January 2olo, the Atorney\nGeneral appointed Sloman to be the Interim U.S. Atorney for the district.

After several years as a line AUSA, Menchel\nbecame Chief of the USAO’s Major Crimes Section. In October 2oo6, Menchel became the Chief\nof the USAO’s Criminal Division, based in Miami. As Criminal Division Chief, Menchel was\npart of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein investigation, and he participated in meetings\nand other communications with defense counsel. Menchel participated in the decision to extend a\ntwo-year state-based plea proposal to Epstein and communicated it to the defense.

This was Acosta’s\nfirst meeting with Epstein’s defense team. Villafafia understood the purpose of this meeting was\nto afford Epstein’s counsel an opportunity to “make a pitch” as to why the case should not be\nprosecuted federally. Villafafia recalled that at a “pre-meet” before defense counsel arrived,\nAcosta did not express concern about the viability of the prosecution or the strength of the case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that the meeting was not “‘a negotiation,” but a chance for the defense to\npresent their arguments, which were made by Starr and focused primarily on federalism. Villafafia\nsimilarly recalled that the meeting mainly consisted of the defense argument that the Epstein case\nshould remain a state mater in which the USAO should not interfere. Both Villafafia and her\nco-counsel recalled that Starr addressed himself directly to Acosta, and that Starr, who had held\nSenate-confirmed positions in the government, commented to Acosta that he and Acosta were “the\nonly people in this room who have run the [gantlet] of confirmation by the Senate.” Acosta did\nnot recall the comment, but he told OPR, “[B]Jack in July, we had decided that we were going\nChapter Three, the Department’s position at the time was that victim consultation was not required in maters in which\nthe government did not pursue a federal charge.

Mr. Epstein was\nfortunate to have such excellent representation.”\n\nVIII. POST-NPA NEGOTIATIONS\n\nAlmost immediately after the NPA was signed, conflicts arose about its terms, and the\ndifficult negotiation process began anew. The USAO quickly realized that there were numerous\nissues concerning the monetary damages provision that were not resolved in the NPA, and the\nparties differed in their interpretations of the § 2255 provision, in particular the role and duties of\nthe atorney representative for the victims. As negotiations regarding the damages provision\ncontinued, the defense was able to delay having Epstein enter his guilty plea in state court.\n\nA. September — October 2oo7: Sloman’s Concerns about Selection of an\n\nAtorney Representative Lead to a Proposed NPA Addendum\n\nThe first controversy centered on the appointment of an atorney representative for the\nvictims. Initially, Villafafia reached out to a private atorney who was one of several suggested to\nher for that role. Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that she was recommending the atorney to serve as\nthe victims’ representative and suggested a phone conference to discuss what information the\nUSAO could disclose to the atorney about the case. Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she had never\nmet the atorney, but he had been recommended by “a good friend in our appellate section” and by\none of the district judges in Miami.'** Over the next few days, Villafafia exchanged messages with\nthe atorney about the possibility of his serving as the atorney representative. She also exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, passing along procedural questions raised by the atorney.\n\nBy this time, Lourie had fully transitioned to his detail at the Department’s Criminal\nDivision. Sloman, who had been on vacation during the week the NPA was finalized, returned to\nthe office, reviewed the final agreement, and immediately expressed his disapproval of the\nprovision authorizing the USAO to select an atorney representative for the victims, which he\nbelieved might raise the appearance of a conflict of interest. Instead, he proposed that a special\nmaster make the selection. Although evidently frustrated by Sloman’s belated proposal, Villafafia\nconveyed to Lefkouitz the suggestion that a special master be appointed to select the atorney\nrepresentative, rather than having the USAO make the selection.!*° She provided Lefkouitz with\nprobe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge, with the\nunderstanding that he will do prison time.” Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For\nTeen Sex Massages,” New York Post, Oct. l, 2oo7.

The defense subsequently raised this as a\nmisconduct issue, alleging that Villafafia was “closely associated” with the individual nominated for the victims’\nrepresentative position.\n\nl35 In a separate email to the proposed atorney representative, Villafafia commented, “[O]f course they tell me\nthis nou.”\n87\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004491.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l94 of 349\nVillafafia had raised (defense counsel’s atempt to insert an immigration waiver into the\nagreement), but Lourie did not comment on the provision promising not to prosecute co-\nconspirators or ask Villafafia to explain why she believed the provision did not harm the\ngovernment’s interests. In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“TaJny other thoughts,” but there is no indication that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.”** Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.”*°? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.”4! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of . . . the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n29 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\nAAO The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstein’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\n24l Villafafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo449l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004509.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l2 of 349\nmanagers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.”*”\n\nSecond, key personnel were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the... bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third\nad In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004529.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 232 of 349\nChief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.”?! Sloman forwarded this\nemail to Acosta. Villafafia recalled that Sloman responded to her email by telephone, possibly\nafter he had spoken to Acosta, and stated, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.” Villafafia did not recall\nSloman explaining at the time the reason for that instruction.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[WJe’ve\nbeen advised that . . . pre-charge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Sloman did not\nrecall any discussions, before the NPA was signed, about contacting the victims or conferring with\nthem regarding the potential resolution of the case. Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that\nwe had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek\napproval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the notification issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.”” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”???\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.””* Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate\n22) Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “he was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\n\n282 Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\ni The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n2o4 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto .. . instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4529", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004609.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3l2 of 349\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into\nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation\nwithout a federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department\ndid not interpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the\nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before\ncriminal charges were brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation\nwas for the purpose of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series\nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of\nthe government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is\ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims\nof a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\n285\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005658.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 6 of l2\nLisa Marie Rocchio, Ph.D. 5\n\nRocchio, L.M.

At trial, Dr. Lisa Rocchio, an expert in\npsychology with a specialized expertise in traumatic stress and interpersonal violence, explained\nthat children are most frequently sexually abused through grooming and coercion in the context of\na relationship. (Tr. 7l3). Dr. Rocchio explained that abusers use a series of deceptive tactics to\nengage a child in sexual abuse. (Tr. 7l5-2o). The defendant and Epstein used such tactics\nthroughout the life of the conspiracy. In the early phase of the conspiracy, from at least\napproximately l994 through approximately 2ool, the defendant identified vulnerable girls,\ntypically from single-mother households and difficult financial circumstances. (PSR § 26). The\ndefendant and Epstein then isolated the girls, spending time with them away from their family and\nfriends. (/d.). During that time, they groomed the girls through techniques such as giving them\ngifts, pretending to be friends, and building trust. (/d.). The defendant and Epstein then\nnormalized sexual situations and sexual touching. (/d.). Finally, they transitioned to sexual abuse,\noften through the pretext of giving Epstein a massage. (/d.). This earlier phase required the\ndefendant and Epstein to identify one girl at a time to target for grooming and abuse.\n\nIn the later phase, from approximately 2ool until at least approximately 2oo4, the\ndefendant and Epstein developed a scheme that created a constant stream of girls who recruited\neach other to visit Epstein at his Palm Beach residence. (PSR § 27). This new approach replaced\nsome of the early grooming and trust-building steps with money provided to girls from struggling\nfamilies. (/d.). Specifically, the defendant and Epstein paid young girls hundreds of dollars in\ncash in exchange for meeting Epstein to be sexually abused—again, often under the pretext of\ngiving Epstein a massage. (/d.). Once a girl was introduced to these sexualized massages, she\nwas offered more money if she brought other teenage girls to engage in sexualized massages with\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo544", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011550.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 737 Filed o7/22/22 Page 3loflol 3l\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl very clear that when you have two knouing conspirators, Maxwell\n2 and Epstein, and they bring in a much younger woman as an\n\n3 assistant and have her take on some of those roles while the\n\n4 defendant remains a lady of the house in the hierarchy of the\n\nS structure to whom a person like Sarah Kellen would report, that\n6 she has leadership of that person; that she is directing that\n\n7 person; that she has control.

(See Dkt. l8 at l9; Tr. 64-65).\nHaving received and reviewed the discovery, the defense nou contends the Government’s\ncorroborating evidence—some of which the Motion itself identifies—is insufficient and reiterates\ndefense complaints that the discovery does not include other types of evidence.' (See Mot. at 3o-\n33).\n\nNone of the defense arguments on this score changes the calculus for this factor. Three\ndifferent victims are prepared to provide detailed testimony describing the defendant’s role in\nEpstein’s criminal scheme to sexually abuse them as minors. As demonstrated by the information\noutlined in the Indictment, these accounts corroborate each other by independently describing the\nsame techniques used by the defendant and Epstein to groom and entice minor girls to engage in\nsex acts. Each victim will describe hou the defendant befriended her, asked detailed questions\nabout her life, and then normalized sexual activity around Epstein. Each victim will describe the\nuse of massage as a technique to <span class=\"highlight\">transition</span> into sexual activity. Each victim will describe hou the\npresence of an adult woman manipulated her into entering an abusive situation. In other words,\nthis is a case that involves multiple witnesses describing the same course of conduct, substantially\ncorroborating each other.\n\n' At the initial bail hearing, the defendant also raised a series of legal challenges she intended to\nmake on the face of the Indictment, all of which she contended weighed in favor of granting bail.\nAfter receiving discovery, the defense nou appears to have abandoned those arguments, at least\ninsofar as they pertain to the issue of bail.\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo73", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021032.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Page2o6 of 22l\nSal\nMeSsQmaxl\nl very clear that when you have two knouing conspirators, Maxwell\n2 and Epstein, and they bring in a much younger woman as an\n3 assistant and have her take on some of those roles while the\n4 defendant remains a lady of the house in the hierarchy of the\n8 structure to whom a person like Sarah Kellen would report, that\n6 she has leadership of that person; that she is directing that\n7 person; that she has control.

Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims.

Villafafia\nsimilarly recalled that the meeting mainly consisted of the defense argument that the Epstein case\nshould remain a state mater in which the USAO should not interfere. Both Villafafia and her\nco-counsel recalled that Starr addressed himself directly to Acosta, and that Starr, who had held\nSenate-confirmed positions in the government, commented to Acosta that he and Acosta were “the\nonly people in this room who have run the [gantlet] of confirmation by the Senate.” Acosta did\nnot recall the comment, but he told OPR, “[B]ack in July, we had decided that we were going\nChapter Three, the Department’s position at the time was that victim consultation was not required in maters in which\nthe government did not pursue a federal charge.

Mr. Epstein was\nfortunate to have such excellent representation.”\nVII. POST-NPA NEGOTIATIONS\n\nAlmost immediately after the NPA was signed, conflicts arose about its terms, and the\ndifficult negotiation process began anew. The USAO quickly realized that there were numerous\nissues concerning the monetary damages provision that were not resolved in the NPA, and the\nparties differed in their interpretations of the § 2255 provision, in particular the role and duties of\nthe atorney representative for the victims. As negotiations regarding the damages provision\ncontinued, the defense was able to delay having Epstein enter his guilty plea in state court.\n\nA, September — October 2oo7: Sloman’s Concerns about Selection of an\n\nAtorney Representative Lead to a Proposed NPA Addendum\n\nThe first controversy centered on the appointment of an atorney representative for the\nvictims. Initially, Villafafia reached out to a private atorney who was one of several suggested to\nher for that role. Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that she was recommending the atorney to serve as\nthe victims’ representative and suggested a phone conference to discuss what information the\nUSAO could disclose to the atorney about the case. Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she had never\nmet the atorney, but he had been recommended by “‘a good friend in our appellate section” and by\none of the district judges in Miami.'** Over the next few days, Villafafia exchanged messages with\nthe atorney about the possibility of his serving as the atorney representative. She also exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, passing along procedural questions raised by the atorney.\n\nBy this time, Lourie had fully transitioned to his detail at the Department’s Criminal\nDivision. Sloman, who had been on vacation during the week the NPA was finalized, returned to\nthe office, reviewed the final agreement, and immediately expressed his disapproval of the\nprovision authorizing the USAO to select an atorney representative for the victims, which he\nbelieved might raise the appearance of a conflict of interest. Instead, he proposed that a special\nmaster make the selection. Although evidently frustrated by Sloman’s belated proposal, Villafafia\nconveyed to Lefkouitz the suggestion that a special master be appointed to select the atorney\nrepresentative, rather than having the USAO make the selection.'°° She provided Lefkouitz with\nprobe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge, with the\nunderstanding that he will do prison time.” Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For\nTeen Sex Massages,” New York Post, Oct. l, 2oo7. ABC News later reported that federal charges “could carry more\nsubstantial prison time.

The defense subsequently raised this as a\nmisconduct issue, alleging that Villafafia was “closely associated” with the individual nominated for the victims’\nrepresentative position.\n\nl35 In a separate email to the proposed atorney representative, Villafafia commented, “[O]f course they tell me\nthis nou.”\n87\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l287", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021367.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l93 3536o38, Pagel95 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l93 of 348\nVillafafia had raised (defense counsel’s atempt to insert an immigration waiver into the\nagreement), but Lourie did not comment on the provision promising not to prosecute co-\nconspirators or ask Villafafia to explain why she believed the provision did not harm the\ngovernment’s interests. In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“Ta]ny other thoughts,” but there is no indication that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.”3° Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.””*? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.**! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of... the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n239 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\nas) The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstein’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\neal Villatafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l367", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021385.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TT 3536o38, Page2l3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ll of 348\nmanagers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.°’\n\nSecond, key personnel were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the .. . bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third\n2oH In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l385", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021405.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 33l 3536o38, Page233 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23l of 348\nChief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.””°! Sloman forwarded this\nemail to Acosta. Villafafia recalled that Sloman responded to her email by telephone, possibly\nafter he had spoken to Acosta, and stated, “[Y]Jou can’t do that nou.” Villafafia did not recall\nSloman explaining at the time the reason for that instruction.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve\nbeen advised that . . . pre-charge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Sloman did not\nrecall any discussions, before the NPA was signed, about contacting the victims or conferring with\nthem regarding the potential resolution of the case. Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that\nwe had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek\napproval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the notification issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.”” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”?”?\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.*™ Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “‘an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate\n29l Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “the was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\neee Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\n\n223 The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n294 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto... instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021487.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON STL 3536o39, Paged/7 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3ll of 348\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into\nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation\nwithout a federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department\ndid not interpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the\nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before\ncriminal charges were brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation\nwas for the purpose of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series\nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of\nthe government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is\ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims\nof a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\n285\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l487", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021576.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document Oo N_Aoo | 3536o39, Pagel46 of 2l7\n3l\nM6SOmaxl\nl very clear that when you have two knouing conspirators, Maxwell\n2 and Epstein, and they bring in a much younger woman as an\n3 assistant and have her take on some of those roles while the\n4 defendant remains a lady of the house in the hierarchy of the\n5 structure to whom a person like Sarah Kellen would report, that\n6 she has leadership of that person; that she is directing that\n7 person; that she has control.

When Acosta left the USAO, Sloman became\nthe Acting U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida, and in January 2olo, the Atorney\nGeneral appointed Sloman to be the Interim U.S. Atorney for the district. Sloman left the USAO\nto enter private practice in June 2olo.\n\nMathew I. Menchel joined the USAO in l998 after having served as a New York County\n(Manhatan) Assistant District Atorney for ll years. After several years as a line AUSA, Menchel\nbecame Chief of the USAO’s Major Crimes Section. In October 2oo6, Menchel became the Chief\nof the USAO’s Criminal Division, based in Miami. As Criminal Division Chief, Menchel was\npart of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein investigation, and he participated in meetings\nand other communications with defense counsel. Menchel participated in the decision to extend a\ntwo-year state-based plea proposal to Epstein and communicated it to the defense. Shortly after\nthat plea offer was extended to Epstein in early August 2oo7, and before the precise terms of the\nNPA were negotiated with defense counsel, Menchel left the USAO to enter private practice.\n\nAndrew C. Lourie joined the USAO as a line AUSA in l994, after having served for three\nyears as an AUSA in New Jersey. During his l3-year tenure at the USAO, Lourie served two\nterms on detail as the Acting Chief of the Department’s Criminal Division’s Public Integrity\nSection, first from September 2ool until September 2oo2, and then from February 2oo6 until July\n2oo6. Between those two details, and again after his return to the USAO in July 2oo6, Lourie was\na Deputy Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, serving as the Managing AUSA for the West\nPalm Beach branch office. Lourie was part of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein\ninvestigation and negotiated the NPA, participating in meetings and other communications with\ndefense counsel. During September 2oo7, while the NPA was being negotiated, Lourie\ntransitioned out of the USAO to serve on detail as the Principal Deputy Assistant Atorney General\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o43", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023100.jpg": "Villafafia added that the PBPD Chief had alerted the FBI that an upcoming news article would\nreport that Epstein was “going to plead to a state charge” and the PBPD Chief “wanted to knou if\nthe victims had been consulted about the deal.” Sloman forwarded Villafafia’s email to Acosta\nwith a note that read simply, “fyi.”\n\nLater that evening, Villafafia circulated to Sloman, Lourie, and Oosterban two alternative\ndocuments: a draft federal plea agreement and a draft NPA.'”° The draft federal plea agreement,\nfollouing the USAO’s standard format, called for Epstein to plead guilty to a five-year conspiracy\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 37l to entice minors to engage in prostitution, an offense requiring registration\nas a sexual offender, with a Rule ll(c) binding sentence of two years’ imprisonment. The draft\nNPA contained the terms presented to the defense team on July 3l, 2oo7, and called for Epstein to\nenter a state plea by September 28, 2oo7. Villafafia told OPR that because she had never seen a\nnon-prosecution agreement before, she relied on a template she found either using USAO or the\nDepartment’s internal online resources, but she did not do any additional research regarding the\nuse of non-prosecution agreements. !°!\n\n3. September 7, 2oo7: Acosta, Other USAO Atorneys, and FBI\nSupervisors Meet with Epstein Atorneys Starr, Lefkouitz, and\nSanchez\n\nOn Friday, September 7, 2oo7, Acosta, Sloman, Villafafia, Villafafia’s co-counsel,\nOosterban, and one or two supervisory FBI agents met at the USAO’s West Palm Beach office\nwith defense atorneys Sanchez and, for the first time, Starr and Lefkouitz.'°? This was Acosta’s\nfirst meeting with Epstein’s defense team. Villafafia understood the purpose of this meeting was\nto afford Epstein’s counsel an opportunity to “make a pitch” as to why the case should not be\nprosecuted federally. Villafafia recalled that at a “pre-meet” before defense counsel arrived,\nAcosta did not express concern about the viability of the prosecution or the strength of the case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that the meeting was not “a negotiation,” but a chance for the defense to\npresent their arguments, which were made by Starr and focused primarily on federalism. Villafafia\nsimilarly recalled that the meeting mainly consisted of the defense argument that the Epstein case\nshould remain a state mater in which the USAO should not interfere. Both Villafafia and her\nco-counsel recalled that Starr addressed himself directly to Acosta, and that Starr, who had held\nSenate-confirmed positions in the government, commented to Acosta that he and Acosta were “the\nonly people in this room who have run the [gantlet] of confirmation by the Senate.” Acosta did\nnot recall the comment, but he told OPR, “[B]ack in July, we had decided that we were going\nChapter Three, the Department’s position at the time was that victim consultation was not required in maters in which\nthe government did not pursue a federal charge.

Mr. Epstein was\nfortunate to have such excellent representation.”\n\nVIII. POST-NPA NEGOTIATIONS\n\nAlmost immediately after the NPA was signed, conflicts arose about its terms, and the\ndifficult negotiation process began anew. The USAO quickly realized that there were numerous\nissues concerning the monetary damages provision that were not resolved in the NPA, and the\nparties differed in their interpretations of the § 2255 provision, in particular the role and duties of\nthe atorney representative for the victims. As negotiations regarding the damages provision\ncontinued, the defense was able to delay having Epstein enter his guilty plea in state court.\n\nA, September — October 2oo7: Sloman’s Concerns about Selection of an\n\nAtorney Representative Lead to a Proposed NPA Addendum\n\nThe first controversy centered on the appointment of an atorney representative for the\nvictims. Initially, Villafafia reached out to a private atorney who was one of several suggested to\nher for that role. Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that she was recommending the atorney to serve as\nthe victims’ representative and suggested a phone conference to discuss what information the\nUSAO could disclose to the atorney about the case. Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she had never\nmet the atorney, but he had been recommended by “a good friend in our appellate section” and by\none of the district judges in Miami.'** Over the next few days, Villafafia exchanged messages with\nthe atorney about the possibility of his serving as the atorney representative. She also exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, passing along procedural questions raised by the atorney.\n\nBy this time, Lourie had fully transitioned to his detail at the Department’s Criminal\nDivision. Sloman, who had been on vacation during the week the NPA was finalized, returned to\nthe office, reviewed the final agreement, and immediately expressed his disapproval of the\nprovision authorizing the USAO to select an atorney representative for the victims, which he\nbelieved might raise the appearance of a conflict of interest. Instead, he proposed that a special\nmaster make the selection. Although evidently frustrated by Sloman’s belated proposal, Villafafia\nconveyed to Lefkouitz the suggestion that a special master be appointed to select the atorney\nrepresentative, rather than having the USAO make the selection.!*° She provided Lefkouitz with\nprobe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge, with the\nunderstanding that he will do prison time.” Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For\nTeen Sex Massages,” New York Post, Oct. l, 2oo7. ABC News later reported that federal charges “could carry more\nsubstantial prison time. Nou, Epstein’s high-pouered lawyers, including Kenneth Starr, . . . may try to get him out\nof registering as a sex offender... .” Scot Michels, “Money Manager Said to Plan to Plead Guilty to Prostitution\nCharges: Jeffrey Epstein may serve about l8 months in prison for soliciting prostitutes,” ABC News, Oct. ll, 2oo7.\nl38 The “good friend” was an AUSA whom Villafafia was dating. The defense subsequently raised this as a\nmisconduct issue, alleging that Villafafia was “closely associated” with the individual nominated for the victims’\nrepresentative position.\n\nl35 In a separate email to the proposed atorney representative, Villafafia commented, “[O]f course they tell me\nthis nou.”\n87\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l25", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023205.jpg": "Villafafia had raised (defense counsel’s atempt to insert an immigration waiver into the\nagreement), but Lourie did not comment on the provision promising not to prosecute co-\nconspirators or ask Villafafia to explain why she believed the provision did not harm the\ngovernment’s interests. In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“TaJny other thoughts,” but there is no indication that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.”°° Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.””*? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.”4! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of . . . the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n239 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\n24o The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstein’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\n24 Villafafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023223.jpg": "managers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.”*”\n\nSecond, key personnel were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the .. . bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third\noad In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23223", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023243.jpg": "Chief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.””?! Sloman forwarded this\nemail to Acosta. Villafafia recalled that Sloman responded to her email by telephone, possibly\nafter he had spoken to Acosta, and stated, “[Y]Jou can’t do that nou.” Villafafia did not recall\nSloman explaining at the time the reason for that instruction.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve\nbeen advised that . . . pre-charge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Sloman did not\nrecall any discussions, before the NPA was signed, about contacting the victims or conferring with\nthem regarding the potential resolution of the case. Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that\nwe had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek\napproval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the notification issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.””” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”???\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.”** Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate\n29l Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “he was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\n\n222 Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\na3 The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n2o4 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto ... instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23243", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023323.jpg": "principles was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into\nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation\nwithout a federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department\ndid not interpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the\nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before\ncriminal charges were brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation\nwas for the purpose of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series\nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of\nthe government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is\ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims\nof a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\n285\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23323", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023477.jpg": "MCC New York's failure to ensure that its security camera system was fully functional and make timely\nrepairs is consistent with the OIG’s previous observations regarding weaknesses in the BOP’s overall system\nof security cameras.

By his oun admission, he actively searches out scientists who are in the forefront of\nsuch research, enjoys meeting and talking with them, and often supports their research\nfinancially with the only proviso that they keep doing what they are doing. One example\nof this is Murray Gell-Mann of the Santa Fe Institute, the Nobel Prize winning physicist\nwho predicted the existence of the quark and who later collaborated with colleagues at\nthe institute on what has become knoun as Chaos Theory.\n\nAnother particular example is Martin A. Nouak, Ph.D., Director of the Program\nfor Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard University. Dr. Nouak recently wrote:\n\nOver the years Jeffrey has taken a great interest in my research work,\nwhich deals with a mathematical description of biological processes. I\n. have had many fruitful discussions with him. Often he would ask\nquestions, which are surprising for me. Often I feel that none of my\nscientific colleagues would have asked that question, because we are too\nengaged in our oun narrou perspective. Jeffrey’s questions and\nproposals are highly original and always surprising. Many of his\nquestions and ideas have led to highly successful research projects. For\nexample, many years ago Jeffrey asked me about group selection, which\nled me to the discovery of the first precise mathematical theory of that\ntopic. A bit later Jeffrey made me think about interaction networks\nbetween people. The result was ‘evolutionary graph theory’, which is new\nfield of mathematical biology. Most recently, Jeffrey discussed with me\ncomplicated ideas about the origin of life and the <span class=\"highlight\">transition</span> from\nchemistry to biology. The discussion also resulted in a highly successful\nand completely new research project. ...\nJeffrey has also financially supported my research projects. He has\ndonated $5oo,ooo to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where\nI have worked as Head of Theoretical Biology from l998 until 2oo3. In\n2oo3, Jeffrey donated $6,5oo,ooo to Harvard University, where I work as\nDirector of the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics and Professor of\nMathematics and Biology.
