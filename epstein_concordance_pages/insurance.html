Ms. Maxwell has requested precisely such particulars from\nthe government, and the government has declined to provide them.\n\nThis information also has not been provided in discovery. Notwithstanding the\ngovernment’s representation that accuser testimony is corroborated by “flight records, diary\nentries, business records, and other evidence,” (Dkt. 4 at 5), the government has not produced\nany such records from which it could be ascertained when or hou Ms. Maxwell is alleged to\n* The indictment identifies the three accusers as Minor Victims l-3.

He was an employee of Mar-a-Lago, and\n2o one of the things Mar-a-Lago does is provide benefits to its\n2l employees.\n22 THE COURT: And then on the business records, your\n23 argument, Ms. Sternheim, is that because it's a form filled out\n24 by Mar-a-Lago employees for the purposes of <span class=\"highlight\">insurance</span> that's\n25 provided by another entity, that they're not a Mar-a-Lago\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool329o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00013291.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 755 Filed o8/lo/22 Page l3 of 262 l7l8\nLC8Cmaxl\n\nl business record?\n\n2 MS.

But Mar-a-Lago does retain these\n\n8 records because, in order to hire, retain, and protect its\n\n9 employees, they presumably make sure they're offered <span class=\"highlight\">insurance</span>.\nlo And I'll just note, your Honor, that the exhibit and\nll Government Exhibit 824 are not just the benefit application\n\nl2 forms, but fax transmital cover sheets from Mar-a-Lago which\nl3 indicates that Mar-a-Lago is doing the work of processing and\nl4 sending out these applications.\n\nl5 MS.

I think the\n\n3 question is, did they do anything to verify the information on\n4 the form. The fact that they provided -- that they sent this\n\n5 form and then <span class=\"highlight\">insurance</span> was provided based on the employee's\n\n6 information, that's the out-of-court statement.

I think it's directly on point, as I said.\n\nlo MR.

ROHRBACH: I think those records do exist, but\n2l T'll just go have a conversation with Ms. Gill about this.\n22 THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim.\n23 MS.

Mr. Rohrbach.\n\n2 MR. ROHRBACH: Your Honor, I have interviewed\n\n3 Ms. Gill. I think she would likely say that the Mar-a-Lago\n\n4 does not make independent efforts to verify information on\n\n5 these forms.\n\n6 I've also been reading United States v. Lieberman. I\n7 do think this case is distinguishable. The case is about an\n\n8 outsider to the hotel filling out a form or -- the case said it\n9 wouldn't mater if the employee filled it out themselves.\n\nlo Verification is important there because they are just\nll taking the information of the outsider at their word. Here,\n\nl2 Mr. Roberts was an employee of Mar-a-Lago; so he had a business\nl3 duty not to lie to his oun employer. So he's not an outsider\nl4 in the traditional sense the way that United States v.\n\nl5 Lieberman and cases like it are talking about. It would have\nl6 been a violation of his duty, a fireable offense, presumably,\nl7 by Mar-a-Lago if he had lied to them about the names of his\n\nl8 dependents and obtained for them <span class=\"highlight\">insurance</span> coverage.\n\nl9 THE COURT: I'm not persuaded that that distinguishes\n2o a binding precedent. It's a point of distinction, but it\nal doesn't shou verification.\n22 Do you have authority for beyond verification, some\n23 obligation to fill it out truthfully or the like?

ROHRBACH: I am not familiar with that case, your\nl7 Honor.\n\nl8 THE COURT: It's prety much directly on point, I\n\nl9 think, for Ms. Sternheim's argument regarding the content of\n2o 823 and 824. Let me give you the cite. It is United States v.\n2l Lieberman, 637 F.2d 95 (2d Cir. l98o).\n22 Do you have any reason to think that the witness would\n23 testify that the employer does anything to verify the\n24 information filled out by the employee on the <span class=\"highlight\">insurance</span> cards?\n25 MR. ROHRBACH: First of all, for 823, your Honor,\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool8877\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00018879.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 755 Filed o8/lo/22 Page l7 of 262 l722\nLC8Cmaxl\n\nl <span class=\"highlight\">insurance</span> benefits to her, they have verified that information.\n2 THE COURT: Well, it's a bit circular. I think the\n\n3 question is, did they do anything to verify the information on\n4 the form. The fact that they provided -- that they sent this\n\n5 form and then <span class=\"highlight\">insurance</span> was provided based on the employee's\n\n6 information, that's the out-of-court statement. It's\n\n7 Mr. Roberts' statement on this form that you're seeking to\n\n8 offer for the truth. So unless there is -- you'll look at the\n9 Lieberman case. I think it's directly on point, as I said.\n\nlo MR. ROHRBACH: I'm happy to look at the case and also\nll ask Ms. Gill, your Honor.\n\nl2 My point is, I think it's more than just sending the\nl3 form and then obtaining <span class=\"highlight\">insurance</span> for someone because their\n\nl4 name is on the form, but it's the course of conduct of paying\nl5 bills for someone who then receives medical treatment because\nl6 that person is insured through Mar-a-Lago.\n\nl7 THE COURT: Well, if she's got information on this\n\nl8 emoloyee with respect to that or records, I suppose that's\n\nl9 another story.\n2o MR. ROHRBACH: I think those records do exist, but\n2l T'll just go have a conversation with Ms. Gill about this.\n22 THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim.\n23 MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, the government would be asking\n24 this witness about a practice that preceded the time period in\n25 which she was there. And the fact of the mater is, requesting\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool8879\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00018880.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 755 Filed o8/lo/22 Page l8 of 262 l723\nLC8Cmaxl\n\nl <span class=\"highlight\">insurance</span> or accepting the offer of <span class=\"highlight\">insurance</span> in and of itself\n2 may be a perk of the business, but puting on the form who you\n3 wish to be insured as your family is hearsay.\n\n4 THE COURT: Agreed.\n\n5) MS. STERNHEIM: So the form itself is one thing, the\n\n6 content is something else.\n\n7 THE COURT: I agree.\n\n8 MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you.\n\n9 THE COURT: I think the only potential for -- and\n\nlo you'll look at the Lieberman case, too, is if there is\n\nll testimony that the employer did something to verify the\n\nl2 information on the form.\n\nl3 So, for examole, if the form says this is my address\nl4 and the testimony is that when an employee fills out this form,\nl5 we look at their driver's license to verify that the address is\nl6 the same, then, as a business, I think, under Lieberman, that\nl7 comes in. It would have to be something comparable for\n\nl8 verification of children -- I think it's children and spouse?\nl9 MS. STERNHEIM: Correct.\n2o THE COURT: In order for this to fit for the content\n2l of the form. It's content versus the form itself. It's\n22 precisely the line that the circuit draws in Lieberman.\n23 MS. STERNHEIM: But in addition, Judge, this witness\n24 does not have any personal knouledge as to what the procedures\n25 were seven years prior to her becoming employed.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool888o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00018887.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 755 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 25 of 262 l73o\nLC8VMAX2\n\nl THE COURT: Okay. Mr. Rohrbach.\n\n2 MR. ROHRBACH: Your Honor, I have interviewed\n\n3 Ms. Gill. I think she would likely say that the Mar-a-Lago\n\n4 does not make independent efforts to verify information on\n\n5 these forms.\n\n6 I've also been reading United States v. Lieberman. I\n7 do think this case is distinguishable. The case is about an\n\n8 outsider to the hotel filling out a form or -- the case said it\n9 wouldn't mater if the employee filled it out themselves.\n\nlo Verification is important there because they are just\nll taking the information of the outsider at their word. Here,\n\nl2 Mr. Roberts was an employee of Mar-a-Lago; so he had a business\nl3 duty not to lie to his oun employer. So he's not an outsider\nl4 in the traditional sense the way that United States v.\n\nl5 Lieberman and cases like it are talking about. It would have\nl6 been a violation of his duty, a fireable offense, presumably,\nl7 by Mar-a-Lago if he had lied to them about the names of his\n\nl8 dependents and obtained for them <span class=\"highlight\">insurance</span> coverage.\n\nl9 THE COURT: I'm not persuaded that that distinguishes\n2o a binding precedent. It's a point of distinction, but it\nal doesn't shou verification.\n22 Do you have authority for beyond verification, some\n23 obligation to fill it out truthfully or the like? In fact,\n24 there's no -- I'm not aware of any obligation of employees to\n25 fill it out truthfully other than the fact that they could get\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool8887\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00018888.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 755 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 26 of 262 l73l\nLC8VMAX2\n\nl fired if they don't.\n\n2 MR.

But if the Court is not persuaded --\n\n6 THE COURT: I don't always find a case on point.\n\n7 You're right, there's a basis to distinguish, but it's prety\n\n8 directly on point; so I think it shous it would be hearsay in\n\n9 the absence of some verification or some nontruth basis for\n\nlo which you're offering.\n\nll MR.

She is weighed while\nclothed on scales that are erratic and not set to zero; on at least one occasion, the scale was set\nabove five pounds. Her eyesight is failing, and her hair is thinning. The guards are far from\nqualified to assess Ms. Maxwell’s physical condition.\n\nReleasing any inmate’s medical information (i.e., weight, vaccinations, etc.) without\ninmate consent is a HIPAA violation. By releasing such information regarding Ms. Maxwell, the\nMDC has violated HIPAA, a privacy breach compounded by the government’s leter. Requesting\nmedical atention puts Ms. Maxwell’s privacy and HIPAA rights at risk. We request that the\nCourt order the MDC to cease releasing Ms. Maxwell’s health information. Breach aside, such\ninformation falls within the “caution” category identified in Your Honor’s Individual Practice in\nCriminal Cases (see 8D (Redactions)). The government, ever protective of sensitive items of\ndiscovery that relate to the alleged victims, should exhibit the same concern for Ms. Maxwell’s\nright to privacy.\n\nThe incident of physical abuse which occurred when Ms. Maxwell was shoved into her\nisolation cell to be searched was previously reported to MDC Legal and the Court and\ninvestigated within the facility. The guard responsible for the abuse is a member of a rotating\nteam that has been the subject of complaint, yet some members were reassigned to Ms. Maxwell\nfor the past two weeks. The incident at issue occurred when Ms. Maxwell was facing forward in\nfront of an officer whose back was in front of the handheld camera. On information and belief,\nthe camera was not recording at that time. The government disputes Ms. Maxwell’s claim by\nciting a video.

While this represents Jeffrey’s outward achievement in life, it is\nhardly the measure of the man, To those who have knoun him long or intimately, he is\na loyal and unselfish friend who has a playful sense of humor. To those in the\nscientific, education, wellness, and civic communities who have benefited from his\nlargesse, he is an unparalleled patron seeking nothing for himself. Finally, and most\nimportantly, to those whe work for him at every level, and to many of those ordinary\ncitizens he has learned of, he has been an extraordinarily generous and understanding\n\nperson, mentor, and friend. :\n\nPersonal History ,\nJeffrey Epstein was born in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn, New York in\n. l953. One of two sons born to Seymour and Paula nee Stolofsky Epstein, Jeffrey was\nraised in modest louer middle class circumstances in a longstanding Jewish\n: neighborhood. Jeffrey’s father supported the family as a laborer for the New York City\nParks Department. Jeffrey’s mother was a housewife until Jeffrey and his brother were in\nhigh school when she went to work for an <span class=\"highlight\">insurance</span> agency. Jeffrey recalled that, during:\nhis youth, the family often played a card game called “Concentration” for entertainment\n. from which he may have developed his early acumen for numbers. Jeffrey described a\n' normal family upbringing in which he felt economically and emotionally secure.\n\nJeffrey atended public schools where his aptitude in mathematics became evident\nearly on. He skipped the third grade at P.S. l88 and was subsequently placed in a special\nprogram which resulted in his skipping the eighth grade at Mark Twain Junior High\nSchool. After his family moved to Seagate, Jeffrey was graduated from Lafayete High\nSchool in l969 at the age of sixteen. Thereafter, continuing to live at home, Jeffrey\natended Cooper Union in Manhatan for two years where he studied Math and Physics.\nJeffrey dropped out of Cooper Union and took independent courses at New York\nUniversity. During this period, Jeffrey drove taxicabs summers in New York City for\nspending money.\n\nl .\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3322l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033233.tif": "atend a college of his choice when the time comes. I would not have been\nable to [do] this if it wasn’t for Mr. Epstein.\nAnother example is that of a building worker named Philip Diaz whom Jeffrey is puting\nthrough vocational school in heating, refrigeration, and air conditioning. Mr. Indyke\nrelated that Jeffrey also takes time from his otherwise hectic schedule to meet with and\nmentor Mr. Diaz.\n\nA final education example was related by David Lambert, an employee:\n\nWhile working late, after normal business hours, I have developed a\nrelationship with the cleaning man who details our office space. Alfredo\nand I reflect life’s issues and family maters as best fas] a Colombian and\nEnglish speaking friend may, but it takes us deep and a look or gesture\nspeaks louder than words at times. One night our sign language, broken\nEnglish and Spanish went to the topic of his oldest daughter atending\ncollege. Alfredo told me hou proud he is of her atending college. “Me\ndaughter, she very, very happy.” I could see the emotion in his eyes which\nled to the words spoken loudly, clearly, and emphatically “... because,\nMister Jeffrey.” After many such conversations with Alfredo it’s clear to\nme he was angst ridden for his children, not being able to provide the\ndream of a college level education, his children aware and sad of such\nconsequence, were whisked away instantly to an ethereal place by one\n\n‘ man. This is what my provider, Jeffrey Epstein, does for people. If he is\naware of human suffering he will act quickly, generously, and without\nthought. Then he will walk away. His goal has been achieved and a life's\ncrisis avoided, human suffering eliminated.\n\nJeffrey is also aware that tragedy is a part of the landscape that people have to\nface and address. When he learns of employees facing such life critical events, he brings\nthe same virtues, ie., empathy, a determination to identify and solve the problem, and\ngenerosity, which he uses in other areas of his life, to bear on the problem. Mr. Indyke\nfaced one such problem, and his recollection of it is worth quoting at length:\n\nShortly after I began working for Jeffrey, I experienced a personal and\n\nunexpected tragedy. After five years of marriage, my wife and I learned\nthat I was infertile and we could not have children in the traditional\n\nmanner. The recommended treatment protocol required my wife and I to\n\nundergo prohibitively expensive in-vitro fertilization cycles, which we\n\ncould not afford and which were not then covered by the company’s\n\nmedical <span class=\"highlight\">insurance</span>.\n\nI meekly approached Jeffrey and asked him if it would be possible to drop\n\nmy wife and me from the company’s medical policy in exchange for a\n\nl3\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33233\n"};
