There is nothing in the NPA that affirmatively shous\nthat the NPA was intended to bind multiple districts. Instead, where\nthe NPA is not silent, the agreement’s scope is expressly limited to the\nSouthern District of Florida. The NPA makes clear that if Epstein\nfulfilled his obligations, he would no longer face charges in that district:\n\nAfter timely fulfilling all the terms and conditions of the\n\nAgreement, no prosecution for the offenses set out on pages l\n\nand 2 of this Agreement, nor any other offenses that have been\n\nthe subject of the joint investigation by the Federal Bureau of\n\nInvestigation and the United States Atorney's Office, nor any\n\" United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985). We recognize that circuits have\nbeen split on this issue for decades. See United States v. Harvey, 79l F.2d 294, 3o3 (4th Cir.\nl986); United States v. Gebbie, 294 F.3d 54o, 55o (3d Cir. 2oo2).\n2 See, e.g., United States v. Prisco, 39l F. App’x 92o, 92l (2d Cir. 2olo) (summary order)\n(applying Annabi to plea agreement entered into in the District of New Jersey); United States\nv. Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 27o (2d Cir. 2oo4) (summary order) (same, to agreement entered\ninto in the District of New Mexico). Nor does Annabi, as Maxwell contends, apply only\nwhere subsequent charges are “sufficiently distinct” from charges covered by an earlier\nagreement.

Jeffrey Epstein, Criminal No. l9-49o\nDear Judge Berman:\n\nWe write to outline the grounds entitling Jeffrey Epstein to pretrial release, proposing a\nstringent set of conditions that will effectively guarantee his appearance and abate any\nconceivable danger he’s claimed to present.\n\nIn essence, the government seeks to remand a self-made New York native and lifelong\nAmerican resident based on dated allegations for which he was already convicted and punished —\nconduct the relitigation of which is barred by a prior federal nonprosecution agreement (the\n“NPA”). The government makes this drastic demand even though Mr. Epstein has never once\natempted to flee the United States — despite a Florida federal judge’s stated belief that he could\nvoid the NPA in appropriate circumstances, possibly threatening new charges there, and\nnotwithstanding legally erroneous government assertions in ancillary litigation that Mr. Epstein\nwas subject to potential prosecution in other federal judicial districts, including this one\nspecifically. Indeed, Mr. Epstein feared the toxic political climate might tempt the government to\ntry and end-run the NPA -— yet continually returned home from travel abroad, fully prepared to\nvindicate his rights under the agreement and otherwise mount a full-throated defense. Finally,\nthe government takes its extreme position in the teeth of Mr. Epstein’s perfect compliance with\nonerous sex offender registration requirements — pinpointing his exact nightly whereabouts —\nacross multiple jurisdictions over a lo-year period.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo274\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000275.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 - Filed o7/ll/l9 Page 2 of l6\n\nNonetheless, it is fundamental that pretrial detention is reserved for “a small but\nidentifiable group of particularly dangerous defendants as to whom neither the imposition of\nstri[ct] release conditions nor the prospect of revocation of release can reasonably assure the\nsafety of the community or other persons.” S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 6-7 (l984), reprinted in l984\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 3l82, 3l89. And that’s true no mater hou much rhetoric and hyperbole the\ngovernment and media pile on a presumptively innocent citizen. Popular condemnation aside,\ncompelling legal issues stand between Mr. Epstein and any possible conviction on the allegations\nof conduct from l4 to l7 years ago pressed in the indictment. Importantly, the Bail Reform Act,\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l4l et seq., authorizes release for even wealthy defendants facing serious charges\nwho travel and oun property abroad.\n\nThe government’s indictment labels this a “Sex Trafficking” case. Yes, the government\nmay have witnesses who will testify to participating in sexual massages — most over l8; some\nunder; some who told the police they lied about their age to gain admission to Mr. Epstein’s\nresidence; some who will testify that Mr. Epstein knew they were not yet l8.! But their\nanticipated testimony only punctuates the alleged offenses’ purely local nature. (All occurred\nwithin a single New York residence or, if the Florida conduct is ultimately ruled admissible\ndespite the NPA, then within two residences.) There are no allegations in the indictment that Mr.\nEpstein trafficked anybody for commercial profit; that he forced, coerced, defrauded, or enslaved\nanybody; or that he engaged in any of the other paradigmatic sex trafficking activity that l8\nU.S.C. § l59l aims to eradicate. No one seeks to minimize the gravity of the alleged conduct,\nbut it is clear that the conduct falls within the heartland of classic state or local sex offenses —\nand at or outside the margins of federal criminal law.\n\nMr. Epstein, 66, is a U.S. citizen who’s lived his entire life in this country. Born and bred\nin Coney Island, he worked his way up from humble origins — his father was a New York City\nmunicipal employee in the Parks Department — and earned every penny he’s made with nothing\nmore than a high school diploma. He speaks only English and knous no other languages. He\nouns no foreign businesses and holds no foreign bank accounts. Five of the six residences he\nmaintains are located here in America. His brother, niece, and nephew all live here too.\n\nUntil his arrest in this case, Mr. Epstein’s only notable brush with the law resulted in the\n2oo7 NPA (Exhibit l) and a 2oo8 state-court guilty plea required by the NPA for conduct\nsubstantially overlapping the conduct charged in the pending indictment. As a result of the state\nguilty plea, Mr. Epstein received a 3o-month sentence, l8 months of incarceration, and l2\nmonths’ probation under conditions including home confinement. Mr. Epstein served l3 months\nin custody, l2 months on probation and, as a <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> of the NPA and his state sentence, was\nrequired to register as a sex offender in the locations of his residences. He is currently registered\n' New York’s age of consent was l7 at the time of the alleged conduct and remains so today.\n\nSee N.Y. Penal Law § l3o.o5.\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo275\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000276.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 - Filed o7/ll/l9 Page 3 of l6\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, his principal residence, Florida, and New York. Mr. Epstein has\nscrupulously fulfilled his obligations in every jurisdiction in which he was required to register\nthroughout the lo-year hiatus between his release and present arrest. All of his travel has been\nmeticulously reported to the registration authorities so that they have been aware of his precise\nlocation every single day for the past lo years. Beter still, the pending charges date back l4-l7\nyears, from 2oo2 to 2oo5. Yet, tellingly, they allege no recurrence of the conduct underlying the\nNPA and Florida state conviction at any time in the ensuing decade and a half (2oo5-2ol9).\nTogether, these unique factors are pouerful indicia that Mr. Epstein is no longer a danger to\nanyone and will faithfully obey all conditions of release if ordered.\n\nIn sum, Mr. Epstein has substantial grounds to challenge the allegations charged by the\ngovernment in its indictment, and he has every intention of doing so in a lawful, professional,\nand principled manner. He intends to fight the current charges on their merits and, more, to\ncontest their legality given the inextricable intertwining of the current investigation and his NPA\nwhich promised him immunity and a global setlement for offenses including those brought\nunder l8 U.S.C. § l59l. Any perception that Mr. Epstein poses any conceivable danger or flight\nrisk may be readily dispelled by a slate of highly restrictive conditions, which amply suffice to\nsecure his release:\n\nl.

Statistically, GPS monitoring is more effective than RF monitoring at\npreventing recidivism.” United States v. Paulino, 335 F. Supp. 3d 6oo, 6l7 n.5 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8)\n(citations omited).\n\n3 Mr. Epstein has only one active passport permiting current travel — not three, as the\ngovernment fancies.

See United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll44 (2d Cir. l986). Accordingly, the\nstatutory demand on defendants “‘is fairly easily met.” United States v. Conway, No. 4-ll-7o756,\n2oll WL 342l32l, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 3, 2oll). To rebut the presumption, a defendant need\nonly “shou that the specific nature of the crimes charged, or that something about their\nindividual circumstances, suggests that ‘what is true in general is not true in the particular\ncase...” United States v. Dominguez, 783 F.2d 7o2, 7o7 (7th Cir. l986) (quoting United States\nv. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378, 384 (lst Cir.l985)). “The quantum of evidence required to rebut the\npresumption is not high.” United States v. Thompson, No. l6-CR-oool9, 2ol8 WL 44733l, at *2\n(M.D. Pa. Jan. l7, 2ol8) (citation omited). “Any evidence favorable to a defendant that comes\nwithin a category listed in § 3l42(g) can affect the operation of [the presumption], including\nevidence of their marital, family and employment status, ties to and role in the community, clean\ncriminal record and other types of evidence encompassed in § 3l42(g)(3).” Dominguez, 783 F.2d\nat 7o7 (clean record plus socioeconomic stability sufficed to rebut presumption).\n\nIn short, evidence that the defendant is unlikely to flee or commit crimes rebuts the\npresumption, forcing the government to persuade the court that detention is warranted. See\nConway, 2oll WL 342l32l, at *5 (§ l59l defendant released pending trial). While not\ndisappearing entirely, the presumption thus recedes to one factor among many in determining\nwhether there are sufficient conditions to “reasonably assure” both presence and safety. See\nMartir, 782 F.2d at ll44; see also United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 89l (8th Cir. l985)\n(“[R]easonably assure” doesn’t mean “guarantee.”). Even in a presumption case, then, “the\ngovernment retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence that the\ndefendant presents a danger to the community,” and by a “preponderance” that he poses a flight\n“tisk.” United States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (citation and internal quotation\nmarks omited).\n\nI. Mr. Epstein’s l4-year record of law-abiding behavior rebuts any presumption in\nfavor of pretrial detention\n\nIn this case, any danger presumption atending the § l59l charges evaporates against Mr.\nEpstein’s meticulous obedience, from 2oo5 to date, to both the law’s commands and his rigorous\nregistration and reporting obligations as a convicted sex offender. The indictment does not allege\nthat Mr. Epstein commited any crime in the l4-year interval between the end of the alleged\nconduct and the initiation of this case. The dangerousness prong of the Bail Reform Act is\npredictive, asking whether it’s likely that Mr. Epstein will reoffend if released. A spotless l4-\nyear record of walking the straight and narrou, complemented by an exemplary lo-year history\nof diligent sex offender registration and reporting, is compelling proof he was able, once the\nprior investigation commenced, to conform his conduct to the law’s dictates. The time lag\nbetween the offenses charged and today is particularly compelling in terms of a prediction of\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo278\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000279.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 - Filed o7/ll/l9 Page 6 of l6\nfuture danger when viewed in the context of the unparalleled global media atention the case has\ngamered, including the creation of a website by the government requesting witnesses claiming\nabuse to come forward. Accordingly, any danger that Mr. Epstein may have once posed to the\ncommunity has long since abated. At the very least, this enormous gap in time precludes a\nfinding by clear and convincing evidence that no conditions of release can reasonably assure the\ncommunity’s safety.°\nThe rebutable presumption of a risk of flight is negated by the evidence that the\n\ngovernment had stated it believed it could prosecute Mr. Epstein for the very same conduct for\nwhich he was immunized, albeit in a second jurisdiction, despite the protections conferred upon\nhim under the NPA. Mr. Epstein’s continuous presence in the United States even while he had a\nresidence out of the country reinforces the point. As detailed belou, Mr. Epstein understood the\nNPA as a global resolution of any charges arising from the alleged conduct at issue here,\nincluding conduct in New York. Indeed, the government, in a Southern District of Florida filing\n® The government vastly overreaches in painting Mr. Epstein as dangerous based on musty plea\ndiscussions. The government’s argument that Mr. Epstein’s release would risk obstructive\nbehavior, at pages 8-9 of its submission, rests primarily upon statements made between Mr.\nEpstein’s prior counsel and an Assistant U.S. Atorney while they searched for a federal offense,\nat the government’s behest, with a one-year statutory maximum or guideline during the give-and-\ntake of those of plea negotiations. The communication from prior counsel about a potential\nproffer for a federal charge was met with the response that there was no sufficient evidence to\ncharge such an offense. These purported facts were mere allegations that did not ultimately\nmanifest themselves in any agreement by Mr. Epstein — nor in any agreement that probable cause\nexisted to support any obstruction or assault charge. And the documents from the Southern\nDistrict of Florida litigation referenced by the government in support of its argument on this\npoint expressly acknouledge this lack of substantiation. See Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2 v.\nUnited States, o8-CV-8o736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkt. 36l-lo (prosecutor stating, “[o]n the obstruction\ncharges, many of the facts that I included in that first proffer were hypothesized based upon our\ndiscussions and the agents’ observations of [redacted]. We will need to interview her to confirm\nthe accuracy of those facts. . . .”), Dkt. 36l-ll (prosecutor stating, “I knou that someone\nmentioned there being activity on an airplane, I just wanted to make sure that there is factual\nbasis for the plea that the agents can confirm”), Dkt. 36l-9 (prosecutor stating, “I don’t knou the\nfactual basis for the alleged [redacted] because we have no independent evidence of that’). In\nshort, these were suggested hypotheses not facts, and the government itself ultimately did not\nbelieve there was factual support for the allegations. They do not provide a sufficiently reliable\nfactual basis for any finding by clear and convincing evidence. As to the suggestion by the\nprosecutor that a charge could be predicated on a prior incident where it was alleged that an\ninvestigator forced a family member of a witness off the road, the defense is without knouledge\nas to the basis for this allegation and the conduct, if it occurred, was not atributable to or\nauthorized by Mr. Epstein.\n\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo279\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000282.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 - Filed o7/ll/l9 Page 9 of l6\nFinally, the government fails to consider the doctrine of pre-indictment delay, inasmuch\n\nas the statute of limitations does not fully define a defendant’s rights with respect to delays that\noccurred prior to the indictment. See generally United States v. Marion, 4o4 U.S. 3o7 (l97l).\nHere, the delays of l4 years from the last alleged act and l2 years since Mr. Epstein signed the\nNPA are extraordinary. If the government is correct that the NPA does not, and never did,\npreclude a prosecution in this district, then the government will have to explain why it\npurposefully delayed a prosecution of someone like Mr. Epstein, who registered as a sex\noffender lo years ago and was certainly no stranger to law enforcement. There is no legitimate\nexplanation for the delay.\nIl. The government fails to meet its burden of proving that no combination of\n\nconditions will assure Mr. Epstein’s appearance and public safety\n\nAn analysis of the relevant statutory factors and case law supports pretrial release. Even\nshould the Court conclude, despite substantial evidence to the contrary, that the defendant\npresents a risk of flight, the foregoing combination of conditions virtually guarantees his\nappearance as required. Crucially, while it is always possible to hypothesize risks, the statutory\nstandard requires only a reasonable assurance that the defendant, if released, will appear. The\nconditions proposed above, including electronic GPS monitoring, surrender of Mr. Epstein’s\npassport, deregistration and/or grounding of Mr. Epstein’s private plane, and a substantial\npersonal bond (including posting of personal residence(s) and/or private jet as security to\nguarantee appearance) would extinguish any plausible risks. Mr. Epstein’s current notoriety\nminimizes any conceivable risk of flight even further. The location where he could be detained —\nhis residence on East 7l‘ Street in New York has entrances (one on the street, one in the back)\nthat can be easily monitored by video. With all of his financial resources in the United States\n(other than his Paris residence) and with his New York residence at risk due to the government’s\nforfeiture allegation, Mr. Epstein would be sacrificing virtually everything he has worked for —\nincluding any collateral the Court requires he post to secure his appearance — if he were to flee\nand to disentitle himself to the defense of his property whether it would be at risk to forfeiture or\nfor a bail violation.\n\nTo the extent there is any doubt regarding the proposed conditions, there is tremendous\nmoral suasion provided by the posting of real and personal property of Mr. Epstein’s brother, and\nhis close personal friend of decades, who have offered to co-sign a surety bond to ensure Mr.\nEpstein’s appearance in Court as required. Indeed, Mr. Epstein’s brother has agreed to pledge\nhis family home, that he shares half the year with his l4-year-old daughter and l7-year-old son,\nin order to secure the bond. It is particularly telling that Mr. Epstein’s brother, his only living\nimmediate family member, as well as his close personal friend, are both willing to guarantee his\nappearance, notwithstanding the widespread negative publicity of Mr. Epstein that has\ndominated the news cycle since his arrest.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo282\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000283.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 - Filed o7/ll/l9 Page lo of l6\n\nTo reiterate, the Bail Reform Act requires pretrial release on the “/east restrictive”\nconditions that will assure both appearance and public safety. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)\n(emphasis added). Home confinement monitored by 24-hour private security guards — a lesser\nrestriction than pretrial detention — has proven effective in meeting those goals in many\nprominent cases prosecuted in our Circuit, including cases against defendants as infamous as\nBernie Madoff, Mare Dreier and David Brooks.\n\nTo be clear, defense counsel are fully confident Mr. Epstein will appear as required\nwithout resort to this measure. And we understand and appreciate Your Honor’s opposition to it.\nSee United States v. Zarrab, No. l5-CR-867, 2ol6 WL 368l423 (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6). Still,\nMr. Epstein stands ready and willing to pay for 24-hour armed guards should the Court deem it\nnecessary or appropriate.\n\nMore precisely, we realize that Your Honor objects to the measure as more akin to\ncustody than release, finding it inequitable for wealthier defendants to “buy their way out” of jail\npending trial. Jd. at *2, *9-lo, *l3 (citation omited). Nonetheless, a band of other courts in our\narea have endorsed the procedure,’ and the Second Circuit has affirmed its use.*\n\nFor reasons explained elsewhere, round-the-clock, privately funded security guards will\nvirtually guarantee — not just reasonably assure — Mr. Epstein’s presence in the circumstances of\nthis case. Accordingly, and given the division of authority surrounding the practice, we\nrespectfully propose it here as a fallback, asking the Court to revisit its propriety despite the\nreservations expressed in Zarrab. Those reservations, though admirably motivated and sincerely\nheld, raise substantial equal protection concerns. They impair the statutory right to release on the\nleast restrictive conditions in the circumstances presented — an inherently individualized\ndetermination — based largely on socioeconomic status, a suspect if not invidious classification.\nAvoiding “inequity and unequal treatment” rooted in such dubious socioeconomic distinctions —\ndoing “equal right to the poor” and “rich” alike — are imperatives that run both ways. /d.

Moreover, as discussed above, Mr. Epstein’s strict compliance with the various\nmonitoring requirements associated with his sex-offender registration actually decrease any\ndanger that he might otherwise pose. It is also worth noting that Mr. Epstein is classified as a\ntier-one sex offender, the louest classification available, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where he\nmaintains his primary residence. The defense respectfully suggests that Mr. Epstein’s Virgin\nIslands designation is more consistent with the circumstances of the actual offenses for which he\nwas convicted, and certainly more consistent with the predictive factor of whether there is a\ndanger of recidivism which the defense contends there is not.\n\nMr. Epstein’s financial means and past international travel do not extinguish this Court’s\ncongressional mandate to order pretrial release in every case where reasonable conditions can\nassure the appearance of the defendant as required.’ Indeed, numerous courts have rejected\ngovernment requests for detention, and instead ordered pretrial release, in cases where the\ncharged defendant was either a non-citizen (unlike Mr. Epstein) or a naturalized citizen with\nsubstantial if not weightier contacts with foreign jurisdictions, including the follouing decisions:\n\ne United States v.

It does not, of course, suggest that wealthy defendants\nshould bear a special disadvantage. The facts supporting the Court’s ruling of pretrial detention\nin Zarrab are easily distinguishable. The present case does not have national security\nimplications, Mr. Epstein is a United States citizen (and does not possess any dual citizenship),\nthe only foreign country in which Mr. Epstein maintains a residence (France) has an extradition\ntreaty with the United States, Mr. Epstein’s assets are almost all located in the United States\n(with the exception of his Paris residence), and Mr. Epstein has provided only truthful\ninformation to Pretrial Services.\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo285\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000288.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 Filed o7/ll/l9 Page l5 of l6\nIV. Sixth Amendment\nFinally, in a case such as this one, which will likely involve voluminous discovery and is\npredicated on events allegedly occurring l4 or more years ago, it is critical to counsel’s ability to\nprovide effective assistance, as well as the defendant’s ability to meaningfully contribute to his\ndefense, that Mr. Epstein be permited pretrial release. The Sixth Amendment “does not provide\nmerely that a defense shall be made for the accused; it grants to the accused personally the right\nto make his defense. It is the accused, not counsel, who must be ‘informed of the nature and\ncause of the accusation,’ and who must be ‘confronted with the witnesses against him,’ and who\nmust be accorded ‘compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.’” Fareta v.\nCalifornia, 422 U.S. 8o6, 8l9 (l975). Given the unique circumstances of this case, Mr.\nEpstein’s exercise of these important Constitutional rights would be materially impaired by his\npretrial detention.\nV. Conclusion\nWherefore, for all of the foregoing reasons, Mr. Epstein respectfully submits that his conduct\nover the past l4 years proves that he poses no risk of flight or threat to the safety of the\ncommunity. Even if the Court should have concerns to the contrary, there clearly exist a\ncombination of conditions that would be sufficient to assure his presence as required and/or the\nsafety of the community, including but not limited to some or all of the conditions proposed\nsupra, or any other conditions the Court deems necessary and appropriate.\nYours truly,\nReid Weingarten\nSteptoe & Johnson, LLP (NYC)\nll4 Avenue of the Americas\nNew York, NY loo36\n(2o2)-5o6-39oo\nFax: (2l2)-5o6-395o\nrweingarten@steptoe.com\nMartin G.

Jeffrey Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (RMB)\n\nDear Judge Berman:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the defendant’s Motion for\nPretrial Release (the “Release Motion’), dated July ll, 2ol9 (Dkt. 6), and in further support of its\nMemorandum in Support of Detention (the “Detention Memo”), submited to Magistrate Judge\nPitman on July 8, 2ol9, which is atached hereto and incorporated herein (Ex. A).\n\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nThe defendant is a serial sexual predator who is charged with abusing underage girls for\nyears. A grand jury has returned an indictment alleging that he sexually exploited dozens of\nminors, including girls as young as l4 years old, in New York and Florida. To this day, he is a\nregistered sex offender designated by New York State in the highest category of risk to reoffend,\ndespite unsuccessfully atempting to have that classification louered. And any doubt that the\ndefendant is unrepentant and unreformed was eliminated when law enforcement agents discovered\nhundreds or thousands of nude and seminude photographs of young females in his Manhatan\nmansion on the night of his arrest, more than a decade after he was first convicted of a sex crime\ninvolving a juvenile.\n\nThe defendant also faces substantial evidence of his guilt, founded on the corroborated\ntestimony of numerous victims, and this case presents the very real possibility that he will go to\nprison for the rest of his life. The defendant has at his disposal a vast fortune, the details of which\nremain largely concealed from the Court. He also has a history of obstruction and manipulation\nof witnesses, including, as detailed herein, as recently as within the past year, when media reports\nabout his conduct reemerged. And he continues to shou a shocking lack of understanding of the\ngravity of the harm he has perpetrated, including through the minimization of his conduct and\ncasual disparagement of victims in his arguments.\n\nAgainst this backdrop of significant—and rapidly-expanding—evidence, serious charges,\nand the prospect of a lengthy prison sentence, the defendant proposes to be released on conditions\nthat are woefully inadequate. The Release Motion misconstrues and misunderstands the relevant\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo329\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000330.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 2 of l4\n\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\n\nUnited States District Judge\n\nJuly l2, 2ol9\n\nPage 2\nlaw, seeks to diminish and demean the harm caused to the many victims of the defendant’s\nappalling sexual abuse, and uterly fails to meet its burden of rebuting the presumption that no\n<span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as\nrequired and the safety of the community. Rather than even atempting to address the grave risks\nof releasing a defendant with extraordinary financial resources and a history of abusing minors,\nthe defendant instead proposes a bail package that amounts to litle more than a barely-secured\nbond masquerading as a l4-point plan. The Court should reject the defendant’s application and\norder him detained pending trial.\n\nAmong other things, the proposed bail package contemplates the defendant pledging as the\nprincipal security a property that has already been identified by the Government as subject to\nforfeiture upon the defendant’s conviction, and which therefore is of no value as collateral. His\nproposed global waiver of extradition is unenforceable, and even if enforceable would be litle\ncomfort to victims forced to wait additional years while the defendant is located and returned to\nthis country. The promise to “deregister or otherwise ground” his private jet is meaningless given\nhis wealth and ability to easily secure other means of travel. The two co-signers he proposes only\nfurther highlight his minimal community ties, including his lack of any family in or near the\nDistrict. Electronic monitoring would merely give the defendant less of a head start in fleeing—\nand does not guard against the risk of him endangering victims in the very home where he has\ncontinued to hoard nude images of young women and girls. And the private security force he\nproposes to guard his gilded cage, a proposal already rejected by this Court in similar\ncircumstances, simply reinforces the obvious fact that the defendant should be housed where he\ncan be secured at all times: a federal correctional center.\n\nThe defendant faces a presumption of detention, Pretrial Services has recommended\ndetention, and victims of the defendant seek his detention. Because there are no set of conditions\nshort of incarceration that can reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant or reasonably\nprotect the community from the dangers he poses if released, the Court should order him detained.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAs previously set forth, a federal grand jury in this District returned an indictment (the\n“Indictment’”) charging the defendant with violating Title l8, United States Code Section l5l9,\nand conspiracy to commit the same.\n\nAs charged by the grand jury, the facts giving rise to those counts involve a years-long\nscheme to sexually abuse underage girls. Specifically, the defendant enticed and recruited dozens\nof minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, for which he paid the victims hundreds of dollars in\ncash, in at least two different states. Victims were initially recruited to provide “massages” to the\ndefendant, which would be performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual\nin nature, and would typically include one or more sex acts, including groping and direct or indirect\ncontact with victims’ genitals. To perpetuate this exploitation of underage girls, the defendant\nactively encouraged certain victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly sexually abused. He\npaid these victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each additional girl they brought to him,\ncreating a network of underage victims for him to exploit in New York and Palm Beach.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo33o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000332.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 4ofl4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 4\nARGUMENT\n\nThe Government respectfully submits that the defendant cannot overcome the statutory\n\npresumption in favor of detention in this case for the follouing reasons, among others:\nI. Victims Seek Detention\n\nPursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (““CVRA”), a crime victim has the right to be\nreasonably heard at certain public proceedings in the district court, including proceedings\ninvolving release. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4). Consistent with that requirement, the Government has\nbeen in contact with victims and counsel identified through this investigation in connection with\nthe argument regarding bail.\n\nMultiple victims and/or their counsel have asked the Government to seek detention (and to\ninform the Court of their views in that respect) for multiple reasons. First, they believe that the\ndefendant’s continued detention is necessary under the CVRA’s right to be reasonably protected\nfrom the accused. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(l). They have specifically conveyed to the Government\nthat they would be fearful for their safety ifthe defendant were released. For the reasons articulated\nherein, the Government believes those concerns to be well-founded.\n\nAdditionally, certain victims have asked the Government to advise the Court that they are\nspecifically concerned about the defendant’s proposal to be released even if under conditions that\nincluded home detention and full-time private guards. They believe it would be unfair to victims\nof a wealthy defendant, like Epstein, if he were to be given greater freedoms than others would be\nin similar circumstances, and that such an arrangement would be inconsistent with their rights.\nThey specifically asked the Government to advise the Court that they believed such an arrangement\ncould result in harassment and abuse by the defendant. ?\n\nIl. The Defendant’s Proposal Does Nothing to Mitigate His Flight Risk\n\nEach of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncounsel strongly in favor of detention, and the defendant’s proposed package would do nothing\nwhatsoever to mitigate those risks.\n\nA. Defendant Proposes No Infringement Upon His Ability to Use his Vast Wealth to Flee\n\nIt might not be immediately apparent to a reader of the Release Motion that the defendant\nis extravagantly wealthy and worth, according to records relating to the defendant recently\nobtained by the Government from a financial institution (“Institution-l”), more than $5oo million.\n> The Government is aware of at least one additional atorney for a victim who has publicly stated\nthat her client supports the pretrial detention of the defendant. The Government is unaware of any\nvictim who has expressed support for the defendant being granted pretrial release on bail.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo332\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000334.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll _ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 6ofl4\nHonorable Richard M.

All this in less than a week, and all in addition to an Indictment that\nalready alleges the existence of dozens of victims in New York and dozens of victims in Florida.\n\nB. The Proposed Bond is Inadequate to Overcome the Presumption of Detention\n\nThe defendant’s “slate of highly restrictive” measures which purportedly “amply suffice to\nsecure his release” are neither highly restrictive nor amply sufficient. Rather, they are effectively\nstandard conditions of home confinement, monitoring, and bond unsecured by the defendant’s\nassets—broken out into l4 pieces. The Government will address the most concerning and salient\nelements of the defendant’s proposal belou.\n\nl. Lack of Meaningful Bond Security\n\nThe defendant proposes that the Court accept his Manhatan mansion as the primary\nsecurity for a personal recognizance bond of an indeterminate amount, to be co-signed by the\ndefendant’s brother and a friend. Release Motion at 4. This is plainly insufficient.\n\nAs an initial mater, and as noted above, the defendant’s Manhatan mansion has been\nidentified in the Indictment as subject to forfeiture because it is alleged to have been used to\ncommit or facilitate the commission of the sex trafficking offenses charged there. See l8 U.S.C.\n§ l594(c)(l). Because the defendant would thus be likely to lose that property follouing a\nconviction, it provides no value whatsoever as collateral. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g)(4) (“In\nconsidering the conditions of release described . . . the judicial officer .. . shall decline to accept\nthe designation, or the use as collateral, of property that, because of its source, will not reasonably\nassure the appearance of the person as required.”). And while the defendant offers to also pledge\nhis private jet as additional collateral, there is absolutely no reason to assume that the defendant\nwould not readily trade his private plane for his freedom. Indeed, the defendant, who has a net\nworth of more than $5oo million, by his oun admission recently sold a second plane and thus\npresumably has cash on hand to replace the posted aircraft without difficulty if need be.\n\nNor does the proposed security of properties ouned by two identified co-signers\nmeaningfully change the calculus. As further described belou, the defendant provides no\ninformation about the value or equity of the property of his brother, Mark (the “Palm Beach\nProperty”), or the significance of that property in the context of his brother’s oun net worth.°®\nSimilarly, the defendant provides no details regarding the “investment interests” of his friend Mr.\nMitchell, nor any reason to believe the loss of those “interests” would be meaningful to Mr.\nMitchell, let alone the defendant. More generally, given the defendant’s proffered net worth, the\ndefendant could easily make his co-signers whole — and even reward them — were he to flee.\n\nThe proposed security, in sum, should give the Court litle comfort the defendant would\nappear in Court if released on bail.\n\n° Tn fact, the defendant’s oun submission makes clear that the Palm Beach Property is not his\nbrother’s exclusive residence and that his brother lives elsewhere for half of the year.\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo334\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000336.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 8 of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 8\n4. Home Confinement and Electronic Monitoring Provide No Assurance\n\nThe defendant’s proposal of ankle-bracelet monitoring should be of no comfort to the\nCourt. In particular, the defendant’s endorsement of a GPS monitoring bracelet rather than a radio\nfrequency bracelet is farcical because neither one is useful or effective after it has been removed.\nAt best, home confinement and electronic monitoring would reduce his head start should he decide\nto cut the bracelet and flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. oo Cr. 773, 2ooo WL ll34364, at *l\n(E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo) (rejecting defendant’s application for bail in part because home detention\nwith electronic monitoring “at best . . . limits a fleeing defendant’s head start”); see also United\nStates v. Casteneda, No. l8 Cr. o47, 2ol8 WL 888744, at *9 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 2ol8) (same); United\nStates v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp.2d 32, 4l (D.D.C. 2oo5) (same); United States v. Benatar, No. o2\nCr. o99, 2oo2 WL 3l4lo262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. lo, 2oo2) (same).\n\n5. Private Security is Inadequate, Unfair, and Impractical Here\n\nThe defendant also proposes the use of a private security force to march him to and from\ncourt under the threat of deadly force. This proposal should be rejected.\n\nAt the outset, it is far from clear that private jail, which seeks to replicate the conditions of\na government-run detention facility in the defendant’s home, is a <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> of “release” that\nimplicates the Bail Reform Act. “[T]here is a debate within the judiciary over whether a defendant,\nif she is able to perfectly replicate a private jail in her oun home at her oun cost, has a right to do\nso under the Bail Reform Act and the United States Constitution.” United States v. Valerio, 9 F.\nSupp. 3d 283, 292 (E.D.N.Y. 2ol4) (Bianco, J.) (collecting cases). The Second Circuit has never\ndirectly addressed this issue. See United States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 78 n.l8 (2d Cir. 2oo7)\n(“The government has not argued and, therefore, we have no occasion to consider whether it would\nbe ‘contrary to the principles of detention and release on bail’ to allou wealthy defendants ‘to buy\ntheir way out by constructing a private jail.” (citations omited)). Indeed, a decision by this Court\nreasoned that “the very severe restrictions” in the private jail proposal presented to him did “not\nappear to contemplate ‘release’ so much as it describes a very expensive form of private jail or\ndetention.” United States v. Zarrab, 2ol6 WL 368l423, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6).\n\nCourts have long been troubled by private jail proposals like the defendant’s which, “at\nbest ‘elaborately replicate a detention facility without the confidence of security such a facility\ninstills.’” United States v. Orena, 986 F.2d 628, 632 (2d Cir. l993) (quoting United States v. Goti,\n776 F. Supp. 666, 672 (E.D.N.Y. l99l) (rejecting private jail proposal)); see also Valerio, 9 F.\nSupp. 3d at 295 (“The questions about the legal authorization for the private security firm to use\nforce against defendant should he violate the terms of his release, and the questions over whether\nthe guards can or should be armed, underscore the legal and practical uncertainties—indeed, the\nimperfections—of the private jail-like concept envisioned by defendant, as compared to the more\nsecure option of an actual jail.”). A private security firm simply cannot replicate the controlled\nenvironment of a federal correctional facility, in which, typically, all of the needs to the prisoner\ncan be atended to without placing the prisoner in the community at large; the defendant’s proposed\nprivate jail arrangement would have the effect of permanently placing him in just such a high-\nflight-risk circumstance. The risk of a public escape atempt while in the community and involving\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo336\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000338.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll _ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page lo of l4\n\nHonorable Richard M.

(“It is contrary to underlying principles of\ndetention and release on bail that individuals otherwise ineligible for release should be able to buy\ntheir way out by constructing a private jail, policed by security guards not trained or ultimately\naccountable to the government, even if carefully selected.”).\n\nIf the defendant’s appearance can only be assured through use of round-the-clock guards,\nthe defendant belongs in a federal detention center, not released under bail conditions that\neffectively create a private prison of one, using guards to be paid by the defendant himself. It is\nfrankly outrageous for the defendant to suggest that preventing him from using his vast wealth to\nduplicate a private prison that cannot control, monitor, and contain him consistent with the\nrequirements of the Bail Act would cause him to somehou “bear a special disadvantage.” Release\nMotion at l2 n.9. Indeed: “What more compelling case for an order of detention is there than a\ncase in which only an armed guard and the threat of deadly force is sufficient to assure the\ndefendant’s appearance?” Zarrab, 2ol6 WL 368l432, at *l2 (quoting United States v. Valerio, 9\nF. Supp. 3d at 295).\n\nTl. The Defendant Provides No Assurance He is Not a Danger to the Community and a\nRisk to Obstruct Justice\n\nA. Danger to the Community\n\nIn the first instance, the defendant’s argument that l4 years without a criminal conviction\neliminates “any danger presumption” should be rejected. Were that the case—which is certainly\nis not—a lack of criminal record for any defendant would automatically rebut the presumption\napplicable to crimes such as sex trafficking. That is manifestly incorrect. See United States v.\nArtis, 6o7 F. App’x 95, 97 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (finding that a defendant’s lack of criminal record was\n“not so compelling as to defeat the presumption or to manifest clear error in the district court’s\ndetermination that no combination of release conditions . . . could reasonably assure against\ndangerousness and the risk of flight”). Moreover, here, the defendant not only has a criminal\nrecord, but has been convicted of a sex crime involving a minor.\n\nBut the ongoing and forward-looking danger posed by the defendant is further\ndemonstrated by the defendant’s maintenance of a substantial collection of photographic trophies\nof his victims and other young females in his mansion, as discovered by the Government through\nits search warrants. As indicated in the Detention Memo, the many discs found in the defendant’s\nresidence included those with hand-writen labels including the follouing: “Young [Name] +\n[Name],” “Misc nudes l,” and “Girl pics nude.” Not surprisingly, the Government has found that\nsuch discs contain photographs of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-nude\nfemales appearing to be underage.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo338\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000343.jpg": "_ Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page l of lo\n.)

Jeffrey Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (RMB)\n\nDear Judge Pitman:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in advance of the bail hearing scheduled\nfor July 8, 2ol9, in the above-captioned case. For the reasons set forth herein, the Court should\norder that the defendant be detained pending trial; he cannot meet his burden of overcoming the\npresumption that there is no combination of conditions that would reasonably assure his continued\nappearance in this case or protect the safety of the community were he to be released.\n\nAs set forth belou, the charges in this case are exceptionally serious: the defendant is\nalleged to be a serial sexual predator who preyed on dozens of minor girls over a period of years,\nand he nou faces a potentially massive prison sentence predicated on substantial and multifaceted\nevidence of his guilt. In light of the strength of the Government’s evidence and the substantial\nincarceratory term the defendant would face upon conviction, there is an extraordinary risk of\nflight, particularly given the defendant’s exorbitant wealth, his ounership of and access to private\nplanes capable of international travel, and his significant international ties. Indeed, the arrest of\nthe defendant occurred when he arrived in the United States on his private jet after having returned\nfrom a multi-week stay abroad.\n\nFinally, and as detailed herein, the Government has real concerns—grounded in past\nexperience with this defendant—that if alloued to remain out on bail, the defendant could atempt\nto pressure and intimidate witnesses and potential witnesses in this case, including victims and\ntheir families, and otherwise atempt to obstruct justice. As a result, he poses both an acute danger\nto the community, including some of its most vulnerable members, and a significant risk of flight.\nThe defendant thus cannot overcome the statutory presumption that detention is appropriate in this\ncase, and the Court should order that he be detained pending trial.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000346.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page4oflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage 4\nARGUMENT\nI. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant’s detention pending trial upon a determination that the defendant is either a\ndanger to the community or a risk of flight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e) (“no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of\nconditions would reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community”). A finding of risk of flight must be supported by a\npreponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. l987);\nUnited States v. Chimurenga, 76o F.2d 4oo, 4o5 (2d Cir. l985). A finding of dangerousness must\nbe supported by clear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 54o,\n542 (2d Cir. l995); Chimurenga, 76o F.2d at 4o5. In addition, a court may also order detention if\nthere is “‘a serious risk that the [defendant] will . . . atempt to obstruct justice, or . . . to threaten,\ninjure, or intimidate, a prospective witness or juror.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2)(B); see also United\nStates v. Friedman, 837 F.2d 48 (2d Cir. l988).\n\nThe Bail Reform Act lists four factors to be considered in the detention analysis: (l) the\nnature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person;\n(3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and]\nfinancial resources”; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant’s release. See\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g). Evidentiary rules do not apply at detention hearings and the government is\nentitled to present evidence by way of proffer, among other means. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2);\nsee also United States v. LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3o-3l (2d Cir. 2ooo) (government entitled\nto proceed by proffer in detention hearings); Ferranti, 66 F.3d at 542 (same); United States v.\nMartir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll45 (2d Cir. l986) (same).\n\nWhere a judicial officer concludes after a hearing that “no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community, such judicial officer shall order the detention of the person before\ntrial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). Additionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with\ncommiting an offense involving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. § l59l, it shall be presumed,\nsubject to rebutal, that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(e)(3)(E).\n\nII. Discussion\n\nThe defendant should be detained pending trial. For the reasons set forth belou, it is\ndifficult to overstate the risk of flight and danger to the community if the defendant is released,\nand for those reasons, the defendant cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of\ndetention in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo346\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000347.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page5oflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage 5\nA. The Defendant Poses an Extreme Flight Risk\n\nEach of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant —\ncounsel strongly in favor of detention.\n\nl. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence\n\nThe “nature and circumstances” of this offense plainly favor detention. l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(g)(l) (specifically enumerating “whether the offense. . . involves a minor victim” as a\nfactor in bail applications). Indeed, the crime of sex trafficking of a minor is so serious that for a\ndefendant charged with that offense, there is a presumption that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the\ncommunity. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 (e)(3)(E). Here, as specified in the Indictment, the defendant’s\nconduct was commited serially, over a period of years, and affected dozens of victims.\n\nThe seriousness of the charge is also reflected in the penalties the defendant faces, which\ninclude up to 45 years of incarceration for Counts One and Two of the Indictment.’ As the Second\nCircuit has noted, the possibility of a severe sentence is a significant factor in assessing the risk of\nflight. See Jackson, 823 F.2d at 7; see also United States v. Cisneros, 328 F.3d 6lo, 6l8 (loth Cir.\n2oo3) (defendant was a flight risk because her knouledge of the seriousness of the charges against her\ngave her a strong incentive to abscond); United States v. Tounsend, 897 F.2d 989, 995 (9th Cir. l99o)\n(“Facing the much graver penalties possible under the present indictment, the defendants have an even\ngreater incentive to consider flight.”). Here, the defendant is facing a statutory maximum of decades\nin prison. Even in the absence of means—which, as discussed in detail belou, the defendant has\nin abundance—this fact alone would provide a compelling incentive for anyone to fail to appear.\nIt is particularly compelling for a defendant who is 66 years old and therefore faces the very real\nprospect of spending the rest of his life in prison if convicted.\n\nThe likelihood of a substantial period of incarceration is butressed by the strength of the\nevidence. As set forth in the Indictment, the evidence in this case is strong. The Indictment alleges\nthat the defendant sexually abused dozens of minor victims, and the conspiracy count lists\nnumerous overt acts commited in furtherance of the defendant’s crimes.*\n> The current penalties for violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l include a lo year mandatory minimum\nsentence. Houever, that punishment was created through an amendment to the statute in 2oo6.\nThe penalty for a violation of Section l59l during the period charged in the Indictment, and\ntherefore relevant here, was a maximum of 4o years’ imprisonment.\n\n4 With respect to the evidence in this case, the Court should start its analysis by accepting that the\n\nIndictment is sufficient, on its oun, to establish probable cause that the defendant commited the\n\ncrimes of sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy. Contreras, 776 F.2d at 54. (“Were an\n\nevidentiary hearing addressing the existence of probable cause required in every § 3l42(e) case in\n\nwhich an indictment had been filed, the court would spend scarce judicial resources considering\n\nthat which a grand jury had already determined, and have less time to focus on the application of\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo347\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000350.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page8oflo\n\nHonorable Henry Pitman\n\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n\nJuly 8, 2ol9\n\nPage 8\nmerely reduce his head start should he decide to flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. oo Cr. 773,\n2ooo WL ll34364, at *l (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo) (Gleeson, J.) (rejecting defendant’s application\nfor bail in part because home detention with electronic monitoring “at best . . . limits a fleeing\ndefendant’s head start”); see also United States v. Casteneda, No. l8 Cr. o47, 2ol8 WL 888744,\nat *9 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 2ol8) (same); United States v. Anderson, 384 F.Supp.2d 32, 4l (D.D.C.\n2oo5) (same); United States v. Benatar, No. o2 Cr. o99, 2oo2 WL 3l4lo262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y.\nOct. lo, 2oo2) (same).\n\nFinally, there can be litle doubt that the defendant is in a position to abandon millions of\ndollars in cash and property securing any potential bond and still live comfortably for the rest of\nhis life. These resources, and the ease with which the defendant could flee and live outside the\nreach of law enforcement—particularly considering his vast wealth and lack of meaningful ties to\nthis District—make the risk of flight exceptionally high in this case, particularly when considered\nin conjunction with the strength of the government’s case and the lengthy sentence the defendant\ncould receive if convicted.\n\nB. The Defendant Poses a Risk of Danger to the Community and of Engaging in\nObstruction of Justice\n\nThe release of the defendant, under any conditions, would pose a significant threat to the\ncommunity and to the ongoing investigation.\n\nAs described above, where there is probable cause to believe that an individual has\ncommited an offense under l8 U.S.C. § l59l, it is presumed that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of\nconditions can reasonably assure the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). Here, not\nonly is the defendant charged with very serious sex crimes against minors, he has already\npreviously admited to—and been convicted of—engaging in related conduct. Specifically, in\nJune 2oo8, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count of procuring a person under the\nage of l8 for prostitution, a felony, and he currently is a registered sex offender, under\nclassification level three in New York—defined as presenting a “high” risk of commiting another\nsex crime and harm to the community. While the conduct presently alleged does not post-date the\n2oo8 conviction, it nevertheless underscores the risk he poses to the community if released.\n\nAdditionally, and in connection with the investigation of the defendant’s offense in Florida,\nthere were credible allegations that the defendant engaged in witness tampering, harassment, or\nother obstructive behaviors. In fact, according to publicly-filed court documents, there were\ndiscussions between prosecutors and the defendant’s then-counsel about the possibility of the\ndefendant pleading guilty to counts relating to “obstruction,” as well as “harassment,” with\nreference to l8 U.S.C. § l5l2, which criminalizes “[t]ampering with a witness, victim, or\ninformant.” For example, in a communication from the defendant’s then-counsel to prosecutors\nin SDFL, his counsel set forth a possible factual proffer that included statements that the defendant\nhad “atempted to harass both [redacted] delay and hinder their receipt of a [redacted] to atend an\nofficial proceeding” and that the defendant “in particular, changed travel plans and flew with both\n[redacted] to the United States Virgin Islands rather than to an airport in New Jersey in order to\natempt to delay their receipt of what Mr. Epstein expected to be a [redacted]” and “further verbally\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo35o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000352.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page looflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage lo\nCONCLUSION\nAs set forth above, in this case, the risk of flight in this case is extraordinarily real. The\ndefendant is extremely wealthy, has extensive foreign contacts, and is charged with serious\noffenses that carry a potential statutory sentence of up to 45 years’ imprisonment—even a fraction\nof which could result in the defendant, who is 66 years old, spending the rest of his life in jail. In\nsum, the defendant’s transient lifestyle, his lack of family or community ties, his extensive\ninternational travel and ties outside the country, and his vast wealth, including his access to and\nounership of private planes, all provide the defendant with the motive and means to become a\nsuccessful fugitive. Further, the nature of the offenses he is alleged to have perpetrated—the abuse\ndozens of underage, vulnerable girls—along with his demonstrated willingness to harass,\nintimidate and otherwise tamper with victims and other potential witnesses against him, render his\ndangerousness readily apparent.\nAccordingly, the Government respectfully submits that the defendant cannot and will not\nbe able to meet his burden of overcoming the strong presumption in favor of detention, that there\nare no conditions of bail that would assure the defendant’s presence in court proceedings in this\ncase or protect the safety of the community, and that any application for bail should be denied.\nVery truly yours,\nGEOFHREY S.

Cash and Diamonds\nAt the Detention Hearing, the Government informed the Court that diamonds and cash\nwere seized from a safe in the defendant’s Manhatan residence. The Court inquired as to the value\nof these items. After conferring with law enforcement agents who have reviewed the materials\nfrom the safe, the Government has learned that the safe contained more than $7o,ooo in cash. In\naddition, the safe contained 48 loose diamond stones, ranging in size from approximately l carat\nto 2.38 carats, as well as a large diamond ring. The Government is currently unaware of whether\nthe defendant maintains similar stashes of cash and/or jewels at his multiple properties, or in other\nlocations. Such ready cash and loose diamonds are consistent with the capability to leave the\njurisdiction at a moment’s notice.\nV. Conclusion\nFor the reasons set forth herein, in the Government’s July 8, 2ol9 and July l2, 2ol9\ndetention memoranda, and on the record at the Detention Hearing, the Court should order that the\ndefendant be detained pending trial. The defendant cannot meet his burden of overcoming the\npresumption that there is no combination of conditions that would reasonably assure his continued\nappearance in this case or protect the safety of the community were he to be released.\nRespectfully submited,\nGEOFFREY S.

In most federal cases the\n\nrebutable presumption that applies favors pretrial release, not remand.\n\nThere is another very important issue to be considered in this case. It has to do with\n“victims” of the crimes charged in the Indictment. Victims refer to the “minor” girls who are\nalleged to have been sexually trafficked by the Defendant. Under l8 U.S.C. § 377l, victims are\nentitled to be heard in court, including on the question of whether the defendant is to be released\nor remanded.

By\nleters, dated July l6 and July l7, 2ol9, Defense counsel also submited information regarding\nEpstein’s New Mexico sex offender registration status. Defense counsel also stated that Epstein\ntraveled extensively over the last eight months and “invariably returned to the to the United\nStates.

Even in those cases that\n\nl2 your Honor listed, the statute contemplates that some l59l\n\nl3 defendants will be released under conditions, and I believe\n\nl4 that the rebutal to the presumption -- one is the danger\n\nl5 prong; one is the flight prong.

WEINBERG: First, as to the conditions, we think\n\n8 your Honor trusted the government, the Bureau of Prisons, to\n\n9 keep our client safe and keep him in civilized conditions. The\nlo government will again ask, as to other defendants, that they be\nll detained at the MCC, some subset of them will end up in the SHU\nl2 unit.\n\nl3 It is a horrific. I've called it medieval. There's\nl4 vermin on the floor. There is wet from the plumbing. There is\nl5 no sunlight. There is limited exercise. It is simply\n\nl6 conditions that no pretrial detainee -- and I would go farther\nl7 as a criminal defense lawyer -- no United States defendant\n\nl8 should be subjected to.\n\nl9 Certain judges have taken views of the conditions. We\n2o would urge your Honor, the government talks about and we talk\n2l about transparency, to see what kind of conditions there exist\n22 within 5o or loo yards of one of the great United States\n23 district courts.\n24 Second, in terms, we have a profound problem with the\n25 conclusions of the medical examiner. There are for three\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo658\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000660.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document53 _ Filed o9/o3/l9 Page 22 of 86 a2\nJ8RSEPSl\n\nl told by a very experienced forensic pathologist that the broken\n2 bones in Mr. Epstein's neck, in his larynx, are more consistent\n3 with external pressure, with strangulation, with homicide, if\n\n4 you will, than with suicide. It doesn't exclude suicide, but\n\n5 the pure medical forensic evidence creates profound issues\n\n6 about what happened to him.\n\n7 Also the time of death. Our medical examiner's\n\n8 opinion is it occurred at least 45 minutes and probably hours\n\n9 before 6:3o a.m. on August lo, when he was first found, if you\nlo will, according to the reports.

She\n3 was told that the principal video that would have shoued the\n\n4 whole hall was corrupted. It was in DC with the FBI to see if\n5 they can reconstruct it.\n\n6 And I asked the same questions that my co-counsel did,\n7 you knou, was the dysfunction of the critical pivotal video, in\n8 the most secure prison east of Florence, out in Colorado knoun\n9 to the MCC before August lo, or was this corruption occurring\nlo on August lo, which would again cause us to be skeptical of the\nll servitude of the medical examiner's conclusions that this was\nl2 suicide rather than some other cause.\n\nl3 So with my co-counsel, we ask your Honor, it is not a\nl4 question of trust or not trust. They ask you to detain people\nl5 and you trust the Bureau of Prisons. And it is within your\n\nl6 inherit authority, your Honor, to find out what happened to our\nl7 client.\n\nl8 We are angry about the conditions he was held in.

The Court is also |\nconcerned for new victims.\n\nMr. Epstein’s alleged excessive atraction to sexual conduct with or in the presence of\nminor girls — which is said to include his soliciting and receiving massages from young girls and\nyoung women perhaps as many as four times a day — appears likely to be uncontrollable.

(Comey, Maurene)\n(Entered: l2/o2/2o2o)\n\nl2/o3/2o2o 8l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly\nprepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for\nrelease on bail. SO ORDERED.

NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nDefendant Ghislaine Maxwell has been indicted by a grand jury on charges of conspiracy\nto entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l; enticing a\nminor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2; conspiracy\nto transport minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l; transporting\nminors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2423 and 2; and two charges\nof perjury, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l623.\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, the Court held a lengthy bail hearing and concluded that the Defendant\nwas a clear risk of flight and that no conditions or combination of conditions would ensure her\nappearance. It therefore denied bail. On December 8, 2o2o, the Defendant filed a renewed\nmotion for release on bail pending trial, which was entered into the public docket on December\nl4, 2o2o. Dkt. No. 96. On December 28, 2o2o, the Court denied that motion, concluding that\nthe Defendant posed a risk of flight and that no combination of conditions could ensure her\nappearance. Dkt. Nos. lo4, lo6.\n\nThe Defendant then filed a third motion for release on bail on February 23, 2o2l. Dkt.\nNo. l6o. In this motion, the Defendant atempts to respond to the reasons that the Court\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo864\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000865.jpg": "CaseCGia26-2-ooSB Adin dd Gumein4lB92 FiRNH6S/22/Phg Page Wof l2\nprovided in denying bail, proposing two additional conditions to the ones she proposed in her\nsecond motion for bail. Specifically, she offers to renounce her French and British citizenship,\nand she also proposes to have her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be\nmonitored by a retired federal judge. See Dkt. No. l6o at 2.\n\nAs set forth belou, the Court concludes that none of the Defendant’s new arguments and\nproposals disturb its conclusion that the Defendant poses a risk of flight and that there are no\ncombination of conditions that can reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, for substantially the\nsame reasons that the Court denied the Defendant’s first and second motions for release, the\nCourt DENIES the Defendant’s third motion for release on bail.\n\nl. Background\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The\nDefendant has been incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center since that time.\n\nThe Defendant renewed her motion for release on bail on December 8, 2o2o. The Court\nagain denied the Defendant’s motion. In doing so, the Court explained that none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments materially impacted its conclusion that the Defendant posed a risk of\nflight. It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry\nlengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the Government,\nincluding multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant’s\nsubstantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo865\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000866.jpg": "CaseCGia26-2l-ooSB Adin dd Gumein47lB92 FiRRG6S/22/Phg Rage BLof l2\nescape; and that the Defendant’s lack of candor regarding her family ties and financial situations\nraised serious doubts as to her willingness to comply with any conditions imposed by the Court.\nSee Dkt. No. lo6.\n\nOn February 23, 2o2l, the Defendant filed a third motion for release on bail. Dkt. No.\nl6o (“Def. Mot.”). The Government opposed the Defendant’s motion on March 9, 2o2l. Dkt.\nNo. l65 (“Gov’t Opp’n’”). The Defendant filed her reply under temporary seal on March l6,\n2o2l.\n\nI. Legal Standard\n\nThe parties dispute whether the divestiture of jurisdiction rule precludes this Court from\ngranting the Defendant’s third bail motion while Defendant’s bail appeal is pending. See Gov’t\nOpp’n at 2-3; Reply at 2-3; see also United States v. Rodgers, lol F.3d 247, 25l (2d Cir. l996)\n(“As a general mater, ‘the filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional significance—\nit confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its control over\nthose aspects of the case involved in the appeal.’”) (citation omited). Under Rule 37(a) of the\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure, houever, the Court unquestionably has authority to defer\nconsidering the motion, deny the motion, or state either that it would grant the motion if the court\nof appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a substantial issue. Fed. R. Crim. P.\n37(a). Because the Court denies the Defendant’s motion, it does not resolve the question of\nwhether it would have jurisdiction to grant it.\n\nPretrial detainees have a right to bail under the Eighth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution and under the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l4l, et seg. The Bail Reform Act\nrequires that a court release a defendant “subject to the least restrictive further <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>, or\ncombination of conditions, that [it] determines will reasonably assure the appearance of the\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo866\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000867.jpg": "CaseGa26-2-ooSB Adin did Gumein47lB92 FiRRG6S/22/Phg Page Wof l2\nperson as required and the safety of any other person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(c)(l)(B). The Court may order that the defendant be held without bail only if, after\nconsidering the factors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>\nor combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and\nthe safety of any other person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nAfter a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can\nreasonably assure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Bail Reform Act allous the\nCourt to reopen the bail hearing if “information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the\ntime of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue” of whether pretrial detention is\nwarranted. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f). The Court is not required to do so if it determines that any new\ninformation would not have a material bearing on the issue. See United States v. Raniere, No.\nl8-CR-2o4l (NGG) (VMS), 2ol8 WL 63442o2, at *2 n.7 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 5, 2ol8) (noting that\n“(a]s the court has already held one detention hearing, it need not hold another”); United States v.\nHavens, 487 F. Supp. 2d 335, 339 (W.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (electing not to reopen a detention hearing\nbecause the new information would not have changed the court’s decision to detain the defendant\nuntil trial). In addition, the Court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent\nauthority, even when the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2-CR-756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y.

In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a\nlimited burden of production . . . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that\nhe does not pose a danger to the community or a risk of flight.”” United States v. English, 629\nF.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir.\n2ool)); see also United States v.

Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll44\n(2d Cir. l986) (“The government retains the burden of persuasion [in a presumption case].”’).\nEven when “a defendant has met his burden of production,” houever, “the presumption favoring\ndetention does not disappear entirely, but remains a factor to be considered among those weighed\nby the district court.” United States v. Matis, 963 F.3d 285, 29o-9l (2d Cir. 2o2o).\nIi. Discussion\nThe Defendant bases her third motion for bail on the Court’s inherent pouers to review\nits oun bail decisions, arguing that the new conditions she proposes warrant reconsideration of\nthe Court’s earlier rulings. See Def. Mot. at 4. She also argues that the strength of the\nGovernment’s case is diminished in light of the arguments she advances in her pre-trial motions,\nwhich are currently pending before the Court. /d. at 7. Having considered those arguments, the\n5\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo868\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000869.jpg": "CaseCGia26-2-ooSB Adin did Gumein47lB92 FiRIB6S/22/Phg Rage of l2\nCourt’s view has not changed. The Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the Defendant presents a risk of flight and that there are no\nset of conditions, including the Defendant’s third set of proposed conditions, that are sufficient to\nreasonably assure her appearance. The presumption in favor of detention, the weight of the\nevidence, and the history and characteristics of the Defendant all continue to support that\nconclusion. The Defendant’s proposed conditions do not alter the Court’s determination.\n\nA. The Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors has not changed\n\nTo begin with, the presumption in favor of detention continues to apply with equal force.\nSee Dkt. No. lo6 (“Dec. Op.”) at 7-8. And though the Court again concludes that the Defendant\nhas met her burden of production, the presumption “remains a factor to be considered among\nthose weighed by the district court.” Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436 (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at\nll44). The Court is mindful “that Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of\nflight, and that ‘a strong probability arises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate\nto secure their appearance.” Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nThe Court’s analysis of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors also remains unchanged.\n\nBecause the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged include crimes involving a minor\nvictim, the first l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factor continues to weigh strongly in favor of detention.\nAnd the Court remains of the opinion that the Defendant does not pose a danger to any person or\nto the community. The fourth § 3l42(g) factor thus weighs against detention.\n\nWith respect to the second § 3l42(g) factor, none of the Defendant’s new arguments alter\nthe Court’s conclusion as to the weight of the evidence. The Defendant argues that the pre-trial\nmotions “raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of charges, if not the entire\nindictment,” and she contends that “[t]hese motions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo869\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000870.jpg": "CaseGa26-2l-oo38 Adin dd Gumein4lB92 FiRNb6S/22/Phag Page of l2\nof the government’s case and warrant granting bail on the conditions proposed.” Def. Mot. at 7.\nThose motions became fully briefed one week ago and are nou pending before this Court. The\nGovernment strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated\nthem. Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the\npresumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the proffered strength\nand nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention. See Dec.\nOp. at 9-lo.\n\nThe Court’s assessment of the Defendant’s history and characteristics has not changed.\nSee Dec. Op. at lo-l6. The Defendant continues to have substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\ndetection. /d. at lo-ll. And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor\nregarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor. See Dec. Op.\nat l6. There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\nconditions of release. Jd. While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors. While the fourth factor continues to\nfavor release, the first three factors and the presumption of detention all support the conclusion\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo87o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000871.jpg": "CaseCGia26-2l-ooSB Adin did Gumein47lB92 FiRNG6S/22/Phg Rage of l2\nthat the Defendant poses a significant risk of flight. Thus, the Court again concludes that there\nare no conditions of release that will reasonably assure her appearance in future proceedings.\n\nB. Pretrial detention continues to be warranted\n\nThe thrust of the Defendant’s argument in her third motion for bail is that the two new\nproposed conditions vitiate the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight. The Defendant first\noffers to renounce her French and British citizenship. Def. Mot. at 2. And she also proposes to\nhave most of her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be monitored by a\nretired federal judge, who would function as an asset monitor and will have co-signing authority\nover the account. /d. Those conditions are offered in addition to the bail package she proposed\nin December. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7; see also Def. Mot. at 2. The new bail package does not\ndisturb the Court’s conclusion that the Government has carried its burden of shouing that these\nconditions are insufficient to mitigate the flight risks, and the Court again determines that no set\nof conditions—including the two new ones—can reasonably assure her future appearance.\n\nThe Court begins with the Defendant’s offer to renounce her French and United Kingdom\ncitizenship. She notes that she can renounce her UK citizenship “immediately upon granting of\nbail,” and she informs the Court that “[t]he process of renouncing her French citizenship, while\nnot immediate, may be expedited.” Def. Mot. at 4. As the Government notes, the offer is of\nunclear validity, and the relevance and practical impact of the renunciations is, at best, unclear.\nSee Gov’t Opp’n at 5. With respect to her offer to renounce her French citizenship, the Court is\nagain confronted with dueling opinions on the correct interpretation of French law. The\nGovernment relies on the position of the head of the International Criminal Assistance Bureau of\nthe French Ministry of Justice, who argues that “the fact that the wanted individual is a French\nnational constitutes an insuperable obstacle to his/her removal,” and that “[a]s long as said\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo87l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000873.jpg": "CaseGia26-2-oo28MAdhn db GuMeiM4lBo2 FiRGHOS/22/PagPeyefiWof l2\nparallel those that the Court articulated when the Defendant proposed signing an extradition\nwaiver. See Dec. Op. at l2-l3.\n\nSimilar doubts exist as to the Defendant’s offer to renounce her UK citizenship. The\nCourt is persuaded by the Government’s arguments that even if the Defendant were to renounce\nher UK citizenship, she would still likely be able to delay or resist extradition from the UK. See\nGov’t Opp’n at 6-7. And for largely similar reasons, the Court again concludes that the\nproposed conditions do not meaningfully diminish the Court’s concerns regarding the\nDefendant’s ability to flee and to frustrate or impair any subsequent extradition atempts. The\npossibility that the Defendant could successfully resist or forestall extradition heightens the\nDefendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nTo summarize, the Defendant’s willingness to renounce her French and UK citizenship\ndoes not sufficiently assuage the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight that the Defendant\nposes. Considerable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the\nrenunciations cloud whatever relevance they might otherwise have to the Court’s assessment of\nwhether the Defendant poses a risk of flight. See United States v. Cohen, No. C lo-oo547 (SD,\n2olo WL 5387757, at *9 n.ll (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2o, 2olo). And that same uncertainty—and the\npossibility that she will be able to successfully resist, or at least delay, extradition—incentivizes\nflight, particularly because of the Defendant’s substantial international ties.\n\nNor does the second proposed <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> materially alter the Court’s determination that no\n<span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions can reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The\nDefendant proposes to have a retired federal judge provide oversight authority over her financial\naffairs, and, if granted, he would have the authority to restrain, monitor, and approve\ndisbursement of assets requiring his signature. See Reply at 5. The Court continues to have\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo873\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000874.jpg": "CaseCGia26-2l-oo28 Adin db GuMeiM4lBo2 FiRGHOS/22/Pag Pegefilof l2\nconcerns about whether the full extent of the Defendant’s assets have been disclosed in light of\nthe lack of transparency when she was first arrested. But the Court assumes, for purposes of\nresolving this motion, that the financial report that it reviewed in December is accurate and that it\naccounts for all of the Defendant’s and her spouse’s assets. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7.\n\nThe monitorship <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> does not reasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance,\neven when viewed in combination with the rest of the Defendant’s bail package. The Defendant\nwould continue to have access to substantial assets—certainly enough to enable her flight and to\nevade prosecution. These include the $45o,ooo that the Defendant would retain for living\nexpenses and any future salaries for her or her spouse, along with other assets, including jewelry\nand other chatels, that are potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. See Def. Mot. at\n5-6; see also Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. While those amounts may be a small percentage of the\nDefendant’s total assets, they represent a still-substantial amount that could easily facilitate\nflight. When combined with the Court’s weighing of the § 3l42(g) factors and the presumption\nof detention, the Court concludes that the proposed restraints are insufficient to alter its\nconclusion that no combination of conditions can reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nIf the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could reasonably assure the\nDefendant’s future appearance, it would order her release. Yet while her proposed bail package\nis substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable assurances. As a result, the Court again\ndetermines that “no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the\nappearance of” the Defendant, and it denies her motion for bail on this basis. l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(l).\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo874\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000884.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 3-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65978, Page8 of 25\no7/o8/2o2o)\n\no7/o8/2o2o | l5 | MOTION for Jeffrey S.

(Comey, Maurene)\n(Entered: l2/o2/2o2o)\n\nl2/o3/2o2o 8l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly\nprepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for\nrelease on bail. SO ORDERED.

As a result of her disturbing and callous conduct, Maxwell nou faces the very real\nprospect of serving many years in prison. The strength of the Government’s evidence and the\nsubstantial prison term the defendant would face upon conviction all create a strong incentive for\nthe defendant to flee. That risk is only amplified by the defendant’s extensive international ties,\nher citizenship in two foreign countries, her wealth, and her lack of meaningful ties to the United\nStates. In short, Maxwell has three passports, large sums of money, extensive international\nconnections, and absolutely no reason to stay in the United States and face the possibility of a\nlengthy prison sentence.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo947\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000950.jpg": "Cased 2o-€f Qo36Go4AUt Tibet 2 oPiled OF2GSQoP aeengecs Boo\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).

Discussion\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the defendant presents an extreme risk of flight, and\ntherefore she cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of detention in this case. Every\none of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances of the\noffense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant — counsel\nstrongly in favor of detention.\n\nA. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence\n\nThe “nature and circumstances” of this offense favor detention. As the Indictment alleges,\nthe defendant commited serious crimes involving the sexual exploitation of minors. See l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(g)(l) (specifically enumerating “whether the offense. . . involves a minor victim” as a\nfactor in bail applications). Indeed, the crimes of enticing and transporting minors for illegal sex\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo95o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000951.jpg": "Cage l24 O/CRODBBOHAEN 2OdcUMENt/2o FilecOOAS2o2P aPage of Goo\nacts are so serious that both crimes carry a statutory presumption that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42\n(e)(3)(E). The defendant repeatedly engaged in this conduct, targeting girls as young as l4 years\nold, for a period of years, and involving multiple minors.\n\nThese offenses carry significant penalties, and the defendant faces up to 35 years’\nimprisonment if convicted. The possibility of a substantial sentence is a significant factor in\nassessing the risk of flight. See United States v. Moscaritolo, No. lo Cr. 4 (JL), 2olo WL 3o9679,\nat *2 (D.N.H. Jan. 26, 2olo) (“|The steeper the potential sentence, the more probable the flight\nrisk is, especially considering the strong case of the government . . . .”) (quoting United States v.\nAlindato—Perez, 627 F. Supp. 2d 58, 66 (D.P.R. 2oo9)). Here, the defendant is facing a statutory\nmaximum of decades in prison. This fact alone would provide a compelling incentive for anyone\nto flee from prosecution, but the incentive to flee is especially strong for this defendant, who, at\nage 58, faces the very real prospect of spending a substantial portion of the rest of her life in prison.\n\nThe strength of the evidence in this case underscores the risk that the defendant will become\na fugitive. As the facts set forth in the Indictment make plain, the evidence in this case is strong.\nMultiple victims have provided detailed, credible, and corroborated information against the\ndefendant. The victims are backed up contemporaneous documents, records, witness testimony,\nand other evidence. For example, flight records, diary entries, business records, and other evidence\ncorroborate the victims’ account of events. This will be compelling evidence of guilt at any trial\nin this case, which weighs heavily in favor of detention.\n\nThe passage of time between the defendant’s conduct and these charges does not counsel\notherwise. As an initial mater, all of the conduct is timely charged, pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3283,\nwhich was amended in 2oo3 to extend the limitations period for conduct that was timely as of the\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo95l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000954.jpg": "Case l24 O/CRODBROHAGN 2OdtUMENt/2o FilecOOAG2o2 P ahage of Gfooo\n\nThe defendant’s international connections and significant financial means would present a\nclear risk of flight under normal circumstances, but in this case, the risk of flight is exacerbated by\nthe transient nature of defendant’s current lifestyle. In particular, the defendant has effectively\nbeen in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July\n2ol9. Thereafter, the defendant — who had previously made many public appearances — stopped\nappearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears\nthat she made intentional efforts to avoid detection, including moving locations at least twice,\nswitching her primary phone number (which she registered under the name “G Max”’) and email\naddress, and ordering packages for delivery with a different person listed on the shipping label.\nMost recently, the defendant appears to have been hiding on a l56-acre property acquired in an\nall-cash purchase in December 2ol9 (through a carefully anonymized LLC) in Bradford, New\nHampshire, an area to which she has no other knoun connections.\n\nThe defendant appears to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United\nStates. She has no children, does not reside with any immediate family members, and does not\nappear to have any employment that would require her to remain in the United States. Nor does\nshe appear to have any permanent ties to any particular location in the United States. As such, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of\novercoming the presumption of detention, because there are no bail conditions that could\nreasonably assure the defendant’s continued appearance in this case.\n\nIn particular, home confinement with electronic monitoring would be inadequate to\nmitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring\ndevice. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would merely reduce her head start\nshould she decide to flee. See United States v.

Mem.”).\n\nIt is difficult to recall a recent case that has garnered more public atention than the\ngovernment’s prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”). In July 2ol9, Epstein was indicted for\noffenses relating to sexual misconduct, amid overwhelming media atention focused on the\nnature of the charges and Epstein’s wealth and lifestyle. On August lo, 2ol9, Epstein died in\nfederal custody, and the media focus quickly shifted to our client—wrongly trying to substitute\nher for Epstein—even though she’d had no contact with Epstein for more than a decade, had\nnever been charged with a crime or been found liable in any civil litigation, and has always\ndenied any allegations of claimed misconduct. Many of these stories and online posts were\nthreatening and harassing to our client and those close to her.\n\nBut sometimes the simplest point is the most critical one: Ghislaine Maxwell is not\nJeffrey Epstein. She was not named in the government’s indictment of Epstein in 2ol9, despite\nthe fact that the government has been investigating this case for years. Instead, the current\nindictment is based on allegations of conduct that allegedly occurred roughly twenty-five years\nago. Ms. Maxwell vigorously denies the charges, intends to fight them, and is entitled to the\npresumption of innocence. Far from “hiding,” she has lived in the United States since l99l, has\nlitigated civil cases arising from her supposed ties to Epstein, and has not left the country even\nonce since Epstein’s arrest a year ago, even though she was aware of the pending, and highly\npublicized, criminal investigation. She should be treated like any other defendant who comes\nbefore this Court, including as to bail. Under the Bail Reform Act, case law in this Circuit and\nother circuits, as well as decisions of this Court, Ms. Maxwell should be released on bail, subject\nto the strict conditions proposed belou.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo96l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000962.jpg": "CE8E9 2o-CFOISSCUAIIN Dobe l &Pitdd B77 POLO Page S| '26oo\n\nBackground. Ms. Maxwell, 58, is a naturalized U.S. citizen who has resided in the\nUnited States since l99l. She is also a citizen of France, where she was born, and of the United\nKingdom, where she was educated and spent her childhood and formative years. Ms. Maxwell\ngraduated from Oxford University. She moved to the United States in l99l, and has lived in this\ncountry ever since that time. Ms. Maxwell has maintained extremely close relationships with her\nsix siblings and her nephews and nieces. They all stood by her in the aftermath of the July 2ol9\nindictment of Epstein and continue to stand by her nou. She is especially close to two of her\nsisters and their children, all of whom reside in the United States. Ms. Maxwell also has\nnumerous friends in the United States who themselves have children, and she is a godmother to\nmany of them. Ms. Maxwell’s family and friends have remained commited to her because they\ndo not believe the allegations against her, which do not match the person they have knoun for\ndecades.\n\nThe Government’s Position. The government has the burden of persuasion in shouing\nthat detention is warranted, and that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that\nwill secure a defendant’s appearance in court. In seeking to carry this burden, the government\nrelies on the presumption of detention in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E), and argues that Ms.\nMaxwell poses a flight risk because she supposedly lacks ties to the United States; is a citizen of\nthe United Kingdom and France, as well as a citizen of the United States, and has passports for\neach country; has traveled internationally in the past; and has financial means. And echoing\nrecent media stories, the government speculates that Ms. Maxwell was “hiding” from law\nenforcement during the pendency of the investigation, even though she has been in regular\ncontact with the government, through counsel, since Epstein’s arrest. Finally, the government\nargues that the nature and circumstances of the offense and the weight of the evidence warrant\n\nZ\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo962\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000963.jpg": "CE8E9 2o-CFOISSCUAIIN Dobe l &Pitdd BPP POLO Page 72cF 26oo\ndetention. Importantly, in contrast with the bail position it took with Epstein, the government\ndoes not and cannot assert that Ms. Maxwell presents a danger to the community under Section\n3l42(g)(4).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s Response. The Court should exercise its discretion to grant bail to Ms.\nMaxwell, on the strict conditions proposed belou (or as modified by the Court), for two\ncompelling reasons.\n\nFirst, the COVID-l9 crisis and its impact on detained defendants warrants release. As\nthis Court has noted, the COVID-l9 pandemic represents an unprecedented health risk to\nincarcerated individuals, and COVID-l9-related restrictions on atorney communications with\npretrial detainees significantly impair a defendant’s ability to prepare her defense. Simply put,\nunder these circumstances, if Ms. Maxwell continues to be detained, her health will be at serious\nrisk and she will not be able to receive a fair trial. (See infra Section I, pages 5 to 9).\n\nSecond, the Court should grant bail because the government has not met its burden under\nthe Bail Reform Act and controlling case law. The presumption relied on by the government\nmay be rebuted, and is so here. Ms. Maxwell has strong ties to the community: she is a U.S.\ncitizen and has lived in this country for almost 3o years; she ran a non-profit company based in\nthe United States until the recent media frenzy about this case forced her to wind it doun to\nprotect her professional colleagues and their organizations; and she has very close ties with\nfamily members and friends in New York and the rest of the country. Nor does her conduct\nindicate that she is a flight risk: she has no prior criminal record; has spent years contesting civil\nlitigation arising from her supposed ties to Epstein; and has remained in the United States from\nthe time of Epstein’s arrest until the present, with her counsel in regular contact with the\ngovernment. She did not flee, but rather left the public eye, for the entirely understandable\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo963\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000964.jpg": "CE8E9 2o-CFOISSCUAUIN Dobe l &Pitdd BPP FOLO Page S°oF 26oo\npurpose of protecting herself and those close to her from the crush of media and online atention\nand its very real harms—those close to her have suffered the loss of jobs, work opportunities,\nand reputational damage simply for knouing her. The government’s remaining arguments—\nabout Ms. Maxwell’s passports, citizenship, travel and financial means— also fail because they\nwould require that every defendant with multiple citizenship and financial means be denied bail,\nwhich is simply not the law. Finally, as discussed belou, the government’s position regarding\nthe nature and circumstances of the offense and weight of its evidence, which relates to alleged\nconduct that is roughly twenty-five years old, is not persuasive and does not alter the bail\nanalysis. (See infra Section II, pages 9 to 2l).\n\nProposed Bail Conditions. In light of the above, we propose the follouing bail\nconditions, which are consistent with those that courts in this Circuit have imposed in analogous\nsituations: (i) a $5 million personal recognizance bond, co-signed by six financially responsible\npeople, all of whom have strong ties to Ms. Maxwell, and secured by real property in the United\nKingdom worth over $3.75 million; (i) travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern Districts of\nNew York; (i) surrender of all travel documents with no new applications; (iv) strict\nsupervision by Pretrial Services; (v) home confinement at a residence in the Southern District of\nNew York with electronic GPS monitoring; (vi) visitors limited to Ms. Maxwell’s immediate\nfamily, close friends and counsel; (vi) travel limited to Court appearances and to counsel’s\noffice, except upon application to Pretrial Services and the government; and (vi) such other\nterms as the Court may deem appropriate under Section 3l42.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act does not discard the presumption of innocence; Ms. Maxwell is\nentitled to that presumption here, as she is in all aspects of this case. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(j)\n(“Nothing in this section [3l42] shall be construed as modifying or limiting the presumption of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo964\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000965.jpg": "CE8E9 2o-CFOISSCUAIIN Dobe l &Pitdd BPP POLO Page SP '26oo\ninnocence.”’). The government has failed to meet its burden of establishing that Ms. Maxwell\npresents an “actual risk of flight” and must be detained under Section 3l42. The strict bail\nconditions outlined above are appropriate under the circumstances and are the “least restrictive”\nset of conditions that will “reasonably assure” Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in Court, without the\nhealth and access to counsel risks inherent in the government’s request that Ms. Maxwell be\ndetained pending trial. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 (c)(l)(B). Under the controlling legal standards,\nMs. Maxwell should be released on bail.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThere are two compelling reasons why the Court should order Ms. Maxwell’s release\non bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed:\n\nFirst, Ms. Maxwell will be at significant risk of contracting COVID-l9 if she is detained,\nand she will not be able to meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense due to the\nrestrictions that have been placed on atorney visits and phone calls in light of the pandemic.\n\nSecond, the government has failed to carry its burden under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 that no\ncombination of conditions can be imposed that will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s presence in\ncourt.\n\nI.

Salerno, 48l\nU.S. 739, 755 (l987). Pretrial detention is appropriate only where “no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the [defendant].” United States v.\nSabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (quoting l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)). The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that a court “shall order the pretrial release” of the defendant (l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(b))\n(emphasis added), but may impose bail conditions if “such release will not reasonably assure the\nappearance” of the defendant in court. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c). Where conditions are necessary,\nsuch release shall be “subject to the /east restrictive . . . set of conditions that [the court]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.” l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(c)(l)(B) (emphasis added).

First, the government\nmust shou “by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant . . . presents an actual risk of\nflight.” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75 (emphasis added). If the government is able to satisfy this\nburden, it must then “demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or\ncombination of conditions could be imposed on the defendant that would reasonably assure his\npresence in court.” Jd.\n\nIn determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the defendant, the court must consider (l) the nature and circumstances of the\noffense charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; (3) the history and\ncharacteristics of the person; and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or\nthe community that would be posed by the person’s release. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nIn this case, unlike in the Epstein case, the government does not contend that Ms.\nMaxwell poses any danger to the community, and therefore the fourth factor does not apply.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act contains a rebutable presumption, applicable based on certain of\nthe crimes charged here, that no conditions will reasonably assure against flight. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(3)(E). In cases where this presumption applies, the “defendant bears a limited burden of\nproduction—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with\nevidence that [she] does not pose . . . a risk of flight.” See United States v. English, 629 F.3d\n3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quotation omited). This rebutable presumption can be readily\nsatisfied, United States v. Conway, No. 4-ll—7o756 MAG (DMR), 2oll WL 342l32l, at *2\n(N.D.

As set forth belou, Ms.\nMaxwell’s personal history, her family and other ties to this country, and her conduct prior\nto her arrest easily rebut the presumption that she presents a risk of flight. For these same\nreasons, the government cannot establish that the strict bail conditions she proposes, which\nare consistent with a number of cases in this Circuit in which courts have ordered release,\nwill not “reasonably assure” her presence in court. Accordingly, the Court should order Ms.\nMaxwell released pursuant to her proposed conditions.\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo97l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000972.jpg": "Case F- 26-4 BOBSHAUR ID SeuMEeN IE Hied GPAB72o Pagers Gf 26o\nl.

Ms.\nMaxwell therefore did what any responsible person would do — she separated herself from\neveryone she cares about and removed herself from the public eye in order to keep herself and\nher friends out of harm’s way.'”\n\nLacking any evidence required under the governing standard that Ms. Maxwell\npresents an “actual risk of flight,” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75, the government’s flight risk\nargument is reduced to the follouing: Ms. Maxwell is a woman of means who has foreign\ncitizenship and has traveled internationally in the past, and who nou faces serious charges.\nBut if that were sufficient, then virtually every defendant with a foreign passport and any\nmeaningful amount of funds would need to be detained as a flight risk. See Hung v. United\nStates 439 U.S. l326, l329 (l978) (to detain based on risk of flight, government must shou\nmore than “opportunities for flight,’ and instead must establish an “inclination on the part of\n[the defendant] to flee”). That is not what the Bail Reform Act requires. Indeed, courts in\nthis Circuit and elsewhere commonly find that bail conditions can adequately address risk of\nflight, even where individuals have foreign citizenship and passports or otherwise substantial\nforeign connections, and financial means. See, e.g., Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 66; United States v.\nHansen, lo8 F. App’x 33l (6th Cir. 2oo4); United States v. Hanson, 6l3 F. Supp. 2d 85 (D.D.C.\n2oo9); United States v.

The government asserts that\ndetention is warranted because of the potential for a long sentence in this case. (Gov. Mem.\nat 4-5.) This oversimplifies the governing standard. Although the severity of potential\npunishment is a relevant consideration, the Second Circuit “require[s] more than evidenceof\nthe commission of a serious crime and the fact of a potentially long sentence to support a\nfinding of risk of flight.” Friedman, 837 F.2d at 49-5o (district court’s finding that\ndefendant posed a risk of flight was clearly erroneous, despite potential for “long sentence\nof incarceration”); see also Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 65, 76-77 (reversing detention order\nwhere defendants agreed to significant physical and financial restrictions, despite the fact\nthat they faced a “lengthy term of incarceration’). Accordingly, the asserted potential for a\nlong sentence does not meet the government’s burden of persuasion.'4\n‘4 The government relies on United States v. Alindato-Perez, 627 F.

At the heart of this case are brave women\nwho are victims of serious crimes that demand justice. The defendant’s motion wholly fails to\nappreciate the driving force behind this case: the defendant’s victims were sexually abused as\nminors as a direct result of Ghislaine Maxwell’s actions, and they have carried the trauma from\nthese events for their entire adult lives. They deserve to see her brought to justice at a trial.\n\nThere will be no trial for the victims if the defendant is afforded the opportunity to flee the\njurisdiction, and there is every reason to think that is exactly what she will do if she is released.\nFor the reasons detailed in the Detention Memorandum, and as further discussed belou, the\ndefendant poses a clear risk of flight, and no conditions of bail could reasonably assure her\ncontinued appearance in this case.

For years before\nher arrest in this case, the defendant likely believed she had goten away with her crimes. That\nillusion has nou been shatered, and she has a host of new reasons to use her considerable resources\nto flee.\n\nMoreover, the defendant’s willingness to brazenly lie under oath about her conduct,\nincluding some of the conduct charged in the Indictment, strongly suggests her true motive has\nbeen and remains to avoid being held accountable for her crimes, rather than to avoid the media.\nAs alleged in the Indictment, in 2ol6, when the defendant was given the opportunity to address\nher conduct with minors in the context ofa civil suit, she lied repeatedly. Those lies are, of course,\nthe subject of two counts of perjury, and they evidence her willingness to flout the law in order to\nprotect herself. The defendant’s lies under oath should give the Court serious pause about trusting\nthis defendant to comply with conditions of bail.\n\nIV. The Defendant’s Bail Proposal Offers No Security For Her Appearance\n\nIn its opening memorandum, the Government highlighted the defendant’s extensive means\nto flee and her opaque finances. In her response, the defendant’s brief provides zero information\nabout her assets in the United States or abroad. The Court should be troubled by this. First, so\nfar as the Government is aware, the defendant has not filled out a financial affidavit, under penalty\nof perjury, in connection with her application for bail, meaning that the Court has no reliable\ninsight into the magnitude or scope of the defendant’s resources. Houever, what the Court does\nhave are strong indicia that the defendant has access to enormous resources, including the large\nproperty she was found on, the private security guard being retained to live with her on that\n* The Government understands from Pretrial Services that the defendant has indicated that she has\nless than a million dollars in bank accounts. The report has not yet been released. As discussed\nbelou, the Court should have serious pause before accepting this unverified information.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo994\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000995.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-ooBaGusnt DOM 2o FilecoOAI3o2P aPage afL2siol9\nproperty, and the multi-million dollar property in the United Kingdom being offered as collateral.\nIndeed, it is revealing that the defendant’s memorandum declines to discuss her assets or the assets\nto which she plainly has access. Without knouing the full scope of the defendant’s financial\nresources, it would be impossible for the Court to even begin to evaluate whether conditions of\nbail would mitigate her risk of flight. More importantly, the defendant cannot claim that she has\nmet her significant burden to rebut the presumption of detention in this case when she has failed\nto provide comprehensive, verified financial information under penalty of perjury.\n\nAlthough the Government submits that no conditions of bail could reasonably assure the\ndefendant’s continued appearance, the defendant’s proposed bail package offers almost no security\nwhatsoever. The defendant appears to have significant assets, she has extensive foreign ties and\nis a citizen of a country that does not extradite its citizens to the United States, and she is charged\nwith serious crimes involving the sexual exploitation of minors — and yet, she asks the Court to\ngrant her bail secured only by a foreign property, which provides effectively no security at all.\n\nIndeed, it is curious that a defendant who appears to have access to millions of dollars has\nnot offered to post a single dime as collateral for the bond she proposes. Instead, as noted, she\noffers as security a foreign property, which is effectively meaningless. As a practical mater, the\nGovernment has no direct way to proceed against foreign property or sureties through bail\nforfeiture, because the Government cannot seize a foreign citizen’s assets abroad or sell property\nin another nation based on a United States bail forfeiture judgment. The Government would be\nrequired to atempt to litigate a property dispute in another country, with a lengthy process and an\nuncertain outcome.\n\nAdditionally, the defendant proffers no information about her proposed co-signers other\nthan that they are friends and relatives — in particular, she provides no information about the assets\nlo\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo995\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000999.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-ooBaGUsnt DOM 22o FilechOAI3o2P aPage a626lol9\nthan any other inmate at the MDC, and thus she cannot claim any greater need for bail than the\nmany inmates awaiting trial there.*\n\nThe virus, of course, presents new and complex challenges for protecting inmates’ health,\nbut the BOP generally, and the MDC specifically, are prepared to handle the risks presented by\nCOVID-l9 and other health issues.

As we noted in our papers, our client is\n2l not Jeffrey Epstein, and she has been the target of essentially\n22 endless media spin that apparently the government has picked up\n23 in its reply brief and in its presentation today, trying to\n24 portray her before the court as a ruthless, aimless, sinister\n25 person.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooolo46\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001049.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 2o-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Pagelo8 of 2oo 45\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl 377(l), and we understand that the court is follouing the\n\n2 statute. The statute gives alleged victims the right to speak\n3 through counsel, through the government, or directly, and be\n\n4 heard, and we understand that, your Honor.\n\n5 The question today before the court, we submit, is\n\n6 whether or not our client could be released or should be\n\n7 released on a <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions to assure\n8 her appearance. And as to that question, the presentations\n\n9 today do not speak, they do not speak to risk of flight, and\nlo the courts have -- in this circuit have thought about and\n\nll researched what weight should be given to that.

A finding of dangerousness, if\n\n9 that were an issue, must be supported by clear and convincing\nlo evidence. A finding that a defendant is a flight risk must be\nll supported by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\nl2 In a case such as this one, where the defendant is\n\nl3 accused of certain offenses involving a minor victim, federal\nl4 law requires that it shall be presumed that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or\n\nl5 combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance\nl6 of the person as required.

For example, the risk of flight in Esposito appears to\nl4 have been based on the resources available to defendant, not\n\nl5 foreign connections or experience and a record of hiding from\nl6 being found.\n\nl7 In Madoff, the defendant had already been released on\nl8 a bail package agreed to by the parties for a considerable\n\nl9 period of time before the government sought detention. The\n2o court there found there were no circumstances in the\nal intervening period shouing that the defendant had become a\n22 flight risk. Because of these crucial factual differences, the\n23 court finds the cases not on point and not persuasive.\n24 Finally, in arguing for release, the defense raises\n25 the challenges and risks posed by the COVID-l9 pandemic.

The argument nonetheless fails in this case for several\na reasons. Most importantly, unlike almost all of the cases in\n\n6 which this court has granted release as a result of COVID-l9,\n\n7 Ms. Maxwell has not argued that her age or underlying health\n\n8 conditions make her particularly susceptible to medical risk\n\n9 from the virus.

Ms. Maxwell has nou been detained\nfor over l5o days in the equivalent of solitary confinement since she was\nindicted and arrested on July 2, 2o2o, despite the fact that she is not a suicide\nrisk and has not received a single disciplinary infraction.

Indeed, in the three months after her arrest, Ms.\nMaxwell was the subject of over 6,5oo national media articles. That exceeds the number of\narticles that mentioned such high-profile defendants as Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby, Joaquin\n“El Chapo” Guzman Loera, and Keith Raniere in the 9o-day period follouing their arrests,\ncombined. The media coverage has ruthlessly vilified her and prejudged her guilt, and has\nexposed her family and friends to harassment, physical threats, and other negative consequences.\n\nBut Ms. Maxwell is not the person the media has portrayed her to be; far from it. And\nher response to these unfounded allegations remains unchanged: she resolutely and vehemently\ndenies them, and she is steadfastly commited to remaining in this country, where she has been\nsince Epstein’s arrest in July 2ol9, to fight them in court. For Ms. Maxwell to flee, she would\nhave to abandon her spouse ee. She will not risk destroying the lives\nand financial well-being of those she holds most dear to live as a fugitive during a worldwide\npandemic. In fact, every action Ms. Maxwell has taken from the time of Epstein’s arrest up to\nthe time of the first bail hearing was designed to protect her spouse from\nharassment, economic harm, and physical danger. Ms. Maxwell wants to stay in New York and\nhave her day in court so that she can clear her name and return to her family.\n\nJustice is not reserved solely for the victims of a crime; it is for the accused as well.\nHere, justice would be served by granting Ms. Maxwell bail under the comprehensive conditions\nwe propose. The alternative is continued detention under oppressive conditions that are\nunprecedented for a non-violent pretrial detainee, which significantly impair her ability to\nparticipate in her defense and prepare for trial and which jeopardize her physical health and\npsychological wellbeing.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooollo8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001109.jpg": "Cased 2o-€FQd3GouAuNt Dibeute/tl $7o 2Fil ed 42SBM 26a cedges HE 2HA5\nARGUMENT\nI.

Far from the\ncruel caricature that the press has so recklessly depicted since the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein,\nthese leters demonstrate that Ms. Maxwell is generous, loving, and devoted to her family\nand friends, and that her life is firmly rooted in this country with her spouse\na. The signatories of these leters have knoun Ms. Maxwell for decades, and\nsome for her entire life. All knou her to be the antithesis of what the government has\nalleged. They trust her completely, including with their minor children.\n\nThese people have stepped forward to support Ms. Maxwell, despite the considerable\nrisk that, if their names ever become public, they will be subjected to some of the same\nrelentless and harassing media intrusion and personal threats that Ms. Maxwell has\nexperienced for years. As a sign of their confidence that Ms. Maxwell will remain in this\ncountry, the sureties have agreed to sign their oun bonds and to post meaningful pledges of\ncash or property in amounts that would cause them significant financial distress if Ms.\nMaxwell were to violate her bail conditions.\n\nThese leters directly address the concern the Court expressed at the last bail hearing\nthat Ms. Maxwell did not have “any dependents | or] significant family ties” to the United\nStates. (Tr. 84). If Ms. Maxwell were to flee, she would be leaving behind the family that\nhas been the center of her life a. she would be abandoning her spouse fj\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001114.jpg": "Cased 2o-CrOd36couAuNit Dibeure/itl $7o 2 il ed A2SRM 26acedge l8 2HA5\n| It is very obvious that they love\nher deeply.

One of the properties is the family home where Ms. Maxwell, her spouse,\na have lived to gether If Ms. Maxwell were to violate her bail\nconditions, which she has no intention of doing, she would be leaving her spouse fj\n|| with virtually nothing.

A Number of Ms. Maxwell’s Family and Friends, and the Security\nCompany Protecting Her, Are Prepared to Sign Significant Bonds\n\nIn addition to her spouse, a number of Ms. Maxwell’s family members and friends,\nmany of whom are US. citizens and residents, have volunteered to step forward as co-\nsigners. These sureties, as well as the others who have writen leters on Ms. Maxwell’s\nbehalf, knou that Ms. Maxwell has never run from a difficult situation and will not do so\nnou. To shou the depth of their support and their confidence that Ms. Maxwell will abide\nby her bail conditions and remain in this country, the sureties have agreed to sign separate\nbonds for Ms. Maxwell in amounts that are significant and meaningful to them, and each\nwould cause severe financial hardship if she were to violate her bail conditions.\n\nFor example, one surety, who is a U.S. citizen and resident, will post the only\nproperty she ouns. This property is worth approximately $l.5 million and is her “only nest-\negg for retirement.” (Ex. C). She writes:\n\nI do not have any other savings and it would be completely devastating\n\nfinancially and in every way to my oun family were the house to be taken\n\nover by the Government due to a breach a bail conditions.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001116.jpg": "Cased 2o-€FQd3GouAuNt Dibeutre/tl $7o 2il ed 42SBM/ 26a cRdge@ 2o 2o45\n(Ud.). Nevertheless, she has “no hesitation” posting her home because she knous “in every\nfibre of | her] being” that Ms. Maxwell “will never try to flee.” (/d.).\n\nSimilarly, another surety who has agreed to sign a $3.5 million bond writes:\n\nThis amount represents the value of effectively all of my assets, including my\n\nhome es If I lost these assets\n\nbecause Ghislaine violated the conditions of her release, I would be\n\nfinancially ruined. I make this pledge without reservation because I knou that\n\nGhislaine will remain in the United States to face the charges against her.\n\n(Ex. F). Two other sureties, one of whom is a U.S. citizen and resident, will post cash bonds\nin the amount of $25,ooo, and another will post $2,ooo in cash, which are significant\npledges for these individuals.\n\nIn addition to these bonds, the security company that will provide security services to\nMs. Maxwell upon her transfer into home confinement has agreed to post a $l million bond\nin support of her bail application. In our collective experience as defense counsel, we are\nnot aware of a previous example where a security company has posted a bond for a\ndefendant. The head of the security company has confirmed that they have never done this\nfor a defendant in the past but are willing to do so here because of his company’s “long-\nstanding relationship with Ms. Maxwell” and because he is “confident that she will not try\nto flee.” (Ex. S).\n\nIn sum, these bonds reflect the depth of support that Ms. Maxwell has from her\nfamily and friends, who are risking their livelihoods, their safety, and their ability to live\nwithout constant media harassment to support her. (See Ex. B) (“Absolutely anyone who\ndares to put their head above the parapet so to speak, to ... support Ghislaine personally, gets it\nshot off immediately amid a hail of social vilification and malignancy and reputational\nslaughtering.””). Ms. Maxwell would never destroy those closest to her by fleeing, after they\nhave risked so much to support her.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001117.jpg": "Cased 2o-€FOd3GouAUNt DibeuMe/tl $7o 2Ail ed 42SBM/ 26a cedge Df 2oa5\nB. Ms. Maxwell Has Provided a Thorough Review of Her Finances for the\nPast Five Years\n\nThe government raised concerns at the initial bail hearing about the accuracy and\ncompleteness of the financial disclosures that Ms. Maxwell provided to Pretrial Services.\n(Dkt. 22 at ll-l2: Tr. 28-29, 34-35). The Court stated that it did not have “a clear picture of\nMs. Maxwell's finances and the resources available to her” and therefore had no way “to set\nfinancial bail conditions that could reasonably assure her appearance in court.” (Tr. 86-87).\n\nTo address the Court’s questions about Ms. Maxwell’s finances, defense counsel\nretained Macalvins, a highly reputable accounting firm in the United Kingdom, to conduct\nan analysis of Ms. Maxwell’s assets and finances for the past five years. The Macalvins\naccountants reviewed thousands of pages of financial documents, including bank statements,\ntax returns, FBAR filings, and other materials to create a clear picture of the assets held by\nMs. Maxwell and her spouse, as well as any assets held in trust for the benefit of Ms.\nMaxwell, and the source of those assets from 2ol5-2o2o. This analysis, which is based in\nsubstantial part on documents that the government provided in discovery, has involved a\nsignificant amount of work and has taken substantial time to complete. It was not possible\nto perform this analysis in the brief time between Ms. Maxwell’s arrest and the initial bail\nhearing, especially with Ms. Maxwell detained follouing her arrest.\n\nThe Macalvins report was also reviewed by i. a Certified Fraud Examiner\nand a former IRS Special Agent with over 4o years of experience in complex financial fraud\ninvestigations. As a Special Agent, f | investigated numerous financial fraud and criminal\ntax cases, including several in this District.

(Tr. 3l-32). She was trying to\nprotect herself as best as she could from harassment by the press, not capture by law\nenforcement. Moreover, this should not be a bar to granting bail. The proposed conditions\nensure her presence at home in plain sight of i” (and the security guards), GPS-\nmonitored, and under strict Pretrial supervision.\n\nD. Ms. Maxwell Has Waived Her Extradition Rights and Could Not Seek\n\nRefuge in the United Kingdom or France\n\nAt the initial hearing, the government argued that Ms. Maxwell, a naturalized U.S. citizen\nwho has lived in the United States for almost 3o years, might flee to the United Kingdom or\nFrance if granted bail, despite the fact that she did not leave the country for nearly a year after\nEpstein’s arrest. (Dkt. 22 at 6.) The government asserted in its reply brief that France “does not\nextradite its citizens to the United States pursuant to French law.” (/d.) At the bail hearing, the\ngovernment represented that “France will not extradite a French citizen to the United States as a\nmater of law, even if the defendant is a dual citizen of the United States,” and that extradition by\nthe United Kingdom would be “lengthy” and “uncertain” with bail “very likely” pending the\nextradition proceeding. (Tr. 27.) These assertions are incorrect, particularly given Ms.\nMaxwell’s irrevocable waiver of her extradition rights with respect to both the United Kingdom\nand France.\n\nAs we noted for the Court at the initial hearing, the concern that Ms. Maxwell would\natempt to flee the United States is entirely unfounded given that Ms. Maxwell had every motive\nand opportunity to flee after the arrest and death of Jeffrey Epstein, but chose to remain in this\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll27\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001128.jpg": "Cased 2o-€F Qd3GouAUNt Dibeutre/otl £7o 2Fil ed 42SBM/ 26a cedge 32 2o5\ncountry. (Dkt. l8 at l2-l4, Tr. 52-53). It is even more unfounded in light of the daily avalanche\nof media coverage of Ms. Maxwell. She is nou one of the most recognizable and infamous\npeople in the world. She is being pursued relentlessly by the press, which would no doubt be\ncamped out by her front door every day if she were granted bail. The notion that Ms. Maxwell\ncould somehou flee to a foreign country during a worldwide pandemic (presumably, by plane),\nwhile being supervised and monitored 24 hours a day and with the eyes of the global press corps\non her every minute, without being caught, is absurd.\n\nTo the extent the Court is concerned that her calculus may have changed since her arrest\nbecause the threat of prosecution has nou crystallized into concrete charges (Tr. 85-86), Ms.\nMaxwell has addressed that concern head-on—she will execute irrevocable waivers of her right\nto contest extradition in both the United Kingdom and France. (Ex. T). These waivers\ndemonstrate Ms. Maxwell’s firm commitment to remain in this country to face the charges\nagainst her. Moreover, as discussed more fully in the atached expert reports, because of these\nwaivers and other factors, it is highly unlikely that Ms. Maxwell would be able to successfully\nresist an extradition request from the United States to either country, in the extremely unlikely\nevent she were to violate her bail conditions. (Exs. U-V). Moreover, any extradition\nproceedings in either country would be resolved promptly. (/d.).\n\nCourts have addressed concerns about a defendant’s ties to a foreign state that enforces\nextradition waivers by requiring the defendant to execute such a waiver as a <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> of\nrelease—including in cases where the defendants, unlike Ms. Maxwell, were not U:S. citizens.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Cirillo, No. 99-l5l4, l999 WL l456536, at *2 (3d Cir. July l3, l999)\n(vacating district court’s detention order and reinstating magistrate’s release order, which\nrequired foreign citizen and resident to sign an “irrevocable waiver of extradition” as a <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll28\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001129.jpg": "Cased 2o-€FQo3GouAUNt Dibeutre/tl $7o 2Fil ed 42SBM/ 26a dedgs BE 2HA5\nof release); United States v.

Cal. l992) (ordering as a\n<span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> of release that defendants “execute waivers of challenges to extradition from any\nnation where they may be found’’). Moreover, a defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal an\nextradition order has been recognized as an indication of the defendant’s intent not to flee. See,\ne.g., United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48, lo52 (S.D.N.Y. l989) (Judge Keenan found\ndefendant’s extradition appeal waiver “manifests an intention to remain here and face the\ncharges against him’’).\n\nIn response to the government’s assertions, Ms. Maxwell has obtained the accompanying\nreports of experts in United Kingdom and French extradition law, who have analyzed the\nlikelihood that Ms. Maxwell, in the event she were to flee to the United Kingdom or France,\nwould be able to resist extradition to the United States after having executed a waiver of her right\nto do so. Both have concluded that it is highly unlikely that she would be able to resist\nextradition successfully.\n\nUnited Kingdom.

(/d. at 2). Mr. Julie bases his opinion largely on (i) Ms.\nMaxwell’s U.S. citizenship; (ll) her irrevocable waiver of her extradition rights with respect to\nthe United States; (i) the fact that the issue would arise only if Ms. Maxwell had fled to France\nin violation of strict bail conditions in the United States: (iv) the fact that a failure to extradite\nwould obligate French authorities to try Ms. Maxwell in French courts for the same 25-year-old\nconduct alleged in the indictment, which did not take place in France; and (v) France’s\ndiplomatic interest in accommodating an extradition request from the United States. (/d.). Mr.\nJulie adds that the extradition process would likely be “disposed of expediently”; where the\nrequesting state emphasizes the urgent nature of the extradition request, “the extradition decree is\ngenerally issued in only a few weeks.” (/d. at 2-3). And in any event, while the extradition\nproceedings are pending, “the French judicial authorities would most certainly decide that |Ms.\nMaxwell] has to remain in custody given her flight from the USA and the violation of her bail\nterms and conditions in this requesting State.” (/d. at l2).\n\nMs. Maxwell has no intention of fleeing the country and has relinquished her nights to\ncontest extradition. She has always maintained her innocence and will continue to fight the\nallegations against her here in the United States, as she has in the past. Even if she were to flee\nafter being granted bail (which she will not), it is likely that Ms. Maxwell would be extradited\nexpeditiously from France or the United Kingdom. Accordingly, the Court should give no\nweight in the bail analysis to the fact that Ms. Maxwell is a dual citizen of these countries. ®\n* Ms. Maxwell would also have very litle incentive to flee to France.

Ms. Maxwell is not obligated to rebut every theoretical possibility that the government\nmight raise that may contribute to a potential flight risk in order to be granted bail. That is not\nthe standard. Cf United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 888 n.4, 892-93 (8th Cir. l985) (“The\nlegal standard required by the |Bail Reform] Act is one of reasonable assurances, not absolute\nguarantees.”). Ms. Maxwell has no intention of fleeing. If she did, then under the proposed bail\nconditions she would lose everything and destroy the family she has been fighting so hard to\nprotect since Epstein’s arrest. Ms. Maxwell will not do that, and should be granted bail.\n\nG. The Alternative to Bail Is Confinement Under Oppressive Conditions\n\nthat Impact Ms. Maxwell’s Health and Ability to Prepare Her Defense\n\nGranting bail to Ms. Maxwell is all the more appropriate and necessary because the past\nfew months have shoun that Ms. Maxwell cannot adequately participate in her defense and\nprepare for trial from the inside the MDC. The alternative to release is her continued\nconfinement under extraordinarily onerous conditions that are not only unjust and punitive, but\nalso meaningfully impair Ms. Maxwell’s ability to review the voluminous discovery produced by\nthe government and to communicate effectively with counsel to prepare her defense.\n\nMs. Maxwell has spent the entirety of her detention nou over five months in de facto\nsolitary confinement, under conditions that rival those used at USP Florence ADMAX to\nsupervise the most dangerous inmates in the federal system and are tantamount to imprisonment\nas a defendant convicted of capital murder and incarcerated on death rou. In fact, multiple\nwardens and interim wardens have remarked that in their collective years of experience they\nhave never seen anything like her current regime. The restrictive regulations to which Ms.\nMaxwell is subjected are not reasonably related to a legitimate goal to ensure the security of Ms.\nMaxwell or the MDC. Instead, it seems clear that the overly restrictive conditions are an\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll37\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001138.jpg": "Cased 2o-€FQd3GouAuNt Dibeutre/ntl $7o 2Fil ed 42SBM/ 26a cedge 42 2o45\nexaggerated response to Epstein’s death, effectively punishing Ms. Maxwell for the BOP’s oun\nnegligence with respect to Epstein.\"\n\nCounsel has atempted to address the restrictions in numerous leters, emails and calls to\nthe MDC warden, the MDC legal department, and the prosecutors, but to no avail. Rather than\nrepeating these points here at length, we refer the Court to our leter to the MDC warden, dated\nOctober 29, 2o2o, which details the most serious and extraordinarily restrictive conditions of\nconfinement.’ These include:\n\n« De Facto Solitary Confinement\n\n= Excessive Surveillance\n\n= Excessive Scanning and Strip Searching\n\n« Deprivation of Food\n\n= Deprivation of Sleep\n\n# Deprivation of Communication with Family and Friends\n\n= Compromised Communication with Legal Counsel\nThe conditions of Ms. Maxwell’s detention are uterly inappropriate, and totally disproportionate\nfor a non-violent pretrial detainee with no prior criminal history facing non-violent charges a\nquarter-century old. Moreover, they adversely impact her ability to prepare her defense and\ncompromise her physical health and psychological wellbeing.\n\nIn addition to these intolerable conditions, Ms. Maxwell has had to contend with\nnumerous unacceptable delays and technical problems with the discovery that the government\nhas produced to her thus far. We have raised these issues with the prosecutors on numerous\noccasions. As we advised the Court in our leter of October 23, 2o2o, defense counsel first\n'! These conditions are especially inappropriate because Ms. Maxwell has been an exemplary inmate and has not\nreceived any disciplinary infractions since her arrest. In fact, she has been made a suicide watch inmate, which is\nthe highest and most trusted responsibility that an inmate can have. It is the height of irony that Ms. Maxwell is\nbeing constantly surveilled as if she were a suicide risk when she, herself, is trusted enough (if she were ever\nreleased from isolation) to monitor inmates who are truly at risk of suicide.\n\n2 The Warden never responded to the leter. In our response to the government’s 9o-day status report concerning\nMDC conditions, counsel requested that the Warden provide a first-hand report to the Court and counsel.

The Court’s conclusion was plainly correct,\nand the Renewed Bail Motion does nothing to undermine it. The offense conduct outlined in the\nIndictment remains incredibly serious, the evidence against the defendant remains strong, and the\ndefendant continues to have extensive financial resources and foreign ties, as well as the\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll46\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001147.jpg": "CaSede2ol er-ODFZocAdNt n Die GMeholooo 2Filed 425o8) 26a Ragef 5 Ob 36\ndemonstrated ability to live in hiding for the long term. In short, the defendant poses an extreme\nflight risk, no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions can reasonably ensure her appearance in this\nDistrict, and the Court should not alter its prior finding to that effect.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAs detailed in the Indictment, the defendant is charged with facilitating the sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims by Jeffrey Epstein between approximately l994 and l997. The defendant\nplayed a critical role in the scheme by helping to identify, entice, and groom minor girls to engage\nin sex acts with Epstein. The defendant’s presence as an adult woman normalized Epstein’s\nabusive behavior, and she even took part in at least some acts of sexual abuse. Together, the\ndefendant and Epstein conspired to entice and cause minor victims to travel to Epstein’s residences\nin different states, which the defendant knew and intended would result in their grooming for and\nsubjection to sexual abuse. Then, in an effort to cover up her crimes, the defendant lied under oath\nduring a civil deposition, including when asked about her interactions with minor girls.\n\nBased on that conduct, the Indictment charges the defendant in six counts. Count One\ncharges the defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage\nin illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Count Two charges the defendant with enticing\na minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2. Count\nThree charges the defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minors to\nparticipate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Count Four charges the defendant\nwith transporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2423 and 2.\nCounts Five and Six charge the defendant with perjury, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l623.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll47\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001148.jpg": "CaSede2ol er-ODFZocAdN n Die GmMeholooo 2Filed 424o8)26a Ragef 6 Ob 36\n\nOn July 2, 2o2o, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) arrested the defendant.\nFollouing extensive briefing, on July l4, 2o2o, the Court held a lengthy bail hearing. In its writen\nand oral submissions, the defense urged the Court to release the defendant on bail.\n\nAmong other things, the defense emphasized the defendant’s family ties and residence in\nthe United States (Dkt. l8 at 2, 3, l2), offered to hire a private security company to monitor the\ndefendant (/d. at 2o), noted that the defendant remained in the country and was in touch with the\nGovernment through counsel follouing Epstein’s arrest (Dkt. l8 at l2-l3; Tr. 49, 52-55), argued\nthat the defendant went into hiding to avoid a media frenzy (Dkt. l8 at l4-l6; Tr. 55-56), and\nargued that detention would hamper the ability to prepare a defense (Tr. 42, 67-69). Responding\nto the Government’s concerns about the lack of transparency about the defendant’s finances and\nsix proposed co-signers, the defense specifically asked the Court to keep the proceedings open if\nthe Court believed additional information or a more fulsome bond would be useful to the bail\ndetermination. (Tr. 52 (“And if the court determines that the conditions that we have proffered are\ninsufficient or need further verification, as long as we can have some assurance of safety and\nconfidentiality, we would recommend that the court keep the proceeding open, and we should be\nable to get whatever the court needs to satisfy it.”); Tr. 59 (“Even if the court were to assume for\npurposes of today’s proceeding that she has the means that the government claims she does, it does\nnot affect the analysis. That is to be addressed in conditions, to be addressed if the court requires\nit, through verifications and further proceedings before the court.”); Tr. 66 (“If the court desires to\nleave the proceeding open for a week and allou us to come back, if the court has concerns about\nthe number of suretors, for example, verification information, information about financial issues,\nwe think that, nou that we have some ability to breathe a litle bit, that we should be able to pull\nthis together for the court’s consideration.”); Tr. 7o (“And if the court needs more information\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll48\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001149.jpg": "CaSede2ol er-OoFZocAdNE n De GmMeholooo 2Filed 425o8) 26a Rage 7l Ob 36\nfrom us, we would respectfully request that the court leave the proceeding open for a week so that\nwe can try to satisfy the court because we want to.”)).\n\nThe Court declined the defense’s request and instead concluded that the defendant posed a\nserious flight risk and that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance. First, the\nCourt found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense here weigh in favor of detention,”\ngiven the statutory presumption of detention triggered by charges involving minor victims and the\npotential penalties those charges carry. (Tr. 82). Second, the Court determined that “[t]he\ngovernment’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong” based on the “multiple\nvictims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in serious crimes,” as well\nas corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Jd.).\nThird, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics demonstrate that the\ndefendant poses a risk of flight. (Tr. 83).\n\nIn addressing that third factor, the Court emphasized the defendant’s “substantial\ninternational ties,’ which “could facilitate living abroad,’ including “multiple foreign\ncitizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least one foreign property of\nsignificant value.” (Tr. 83). The Court also noted that the defendant “is a citizen of France, a\nnation that does not appear to extradite its citizens.” (/d.). The Court further found that the\ndefendant “possesses extraordinary financial resources” and that “the representations made to\nPretrial Services regarding the defendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid\npicture of the resources available.” (Tr. 83-84).\n\nAlthough the Court recognized that the defendant “does have some family and personal\nconnections to the United States,” the Court highlighted “the absence of any dependents,\nsignificant family ties or employment in the United States” in support of the conclusion that “flight\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll49\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001150.jpg": "CaSede2ol er-ODFZocAdNE n Die GMeholooo Aled 425o8) 26a Ragef 8 Ob 36\n\nwould not pose an insurmountable burden for her.” (Tr. 84). The Court recognized the defense\narguments that the defendant did not leave the United States after Epstein’s arrest and was in\ncontact with the Government through counsel, but emphasized that the defendant may have\nexpected that she would not be prosecuted. (Tr. 84-85). The Court also noted that the defendant\n“did not provide the government with her whereabouts,” and that the “[c]ircumstances of her arrest\n... may cast some doubt on the claim that she was not hiding from the government, a claim that\nshe makes throughout the papers and here today, but even if true, the reality that Ms. Maxwell may\nface such serious charges herself may not have set in until she was actually indicted.” (Tr. 85).\nBased on all of those factors, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of\ndemonstrating that the defendant “poses a substantial actual risk of flight.” (Tr. 86).\n\nThe Court then concluded that “even the most restrictive conditions of release would be\ninsufficient” to ensure the defendant’s appearance. (/d.). Acknouledging that the defense’s initial\nbail package represented only a fraction of the defendant’s assets, the Court found that “even a\nsubstantially larger package would be insufficient.” (/d.). Although the defendant “apparently\nfailed to submit a full accounting or even close to full accounting of her financial situation,” the\nCourt implicitly rejected the defense’s offer to provide additional information by determining that\n““/e/ven if the picture of her financial resources were not opaque, as it is, detention would still be\nappropriate.” (Tr. 86-87 (emphasis added)). That conclusion was informed not only by the\ndefendant’s “significant financial resources,” but also her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (Tr. 87). “Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nfrom the press and the public,” the Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent conduct\nunderscores her extraordinary capacity to evade detection, even in the face of what the defense has\nacknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.). Given that sophistication,\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll5o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001151.jpg": "CaSesb:2o-cr/ oo 8B G+ANEt DOEUMEr? loo2 Filed6R248/7thgPageb l636\n\nthe Court concluded that electronic monitoring and home security guards “would be insufficient”\nbecause the defendant could remove the monitor and evade security guards. (Tr. 87-88). Finally,\nthe Court rejected the defense’s arguments about the risks of COVID-l9 and the difficulty of\npreparing a defense with an incarcerated client. In so doing, the Court noted that the defendant\nhas no underlying conditions that place her at heightened risk of complications from COVID-l9\nand emphasized that the defendant had many months to prepare for trial. (Tr. 89-9o).\n\nViewing all of these factors together, the Court ordered the defendant detained pending\ntrial. (Tr. 9l).\n\nAPPLICABLE LAW\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant detained pending trial upon a determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). When seeking detention on this ground, “[t]he Government bears the\nburden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence both that the defendant ‘presents an actual\nrisk of flight’ and that ‘no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions could be imposed on the\ndefendant that would reasonably assure his presence in court.’” United States v. Boustani, 932\nF.3d 79, 8l (2d Cir. 2ol9) (quoting United States v. Sabhani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7)). The\nBail Reform Act lists three factors to be considered in the detention analysis when the Government\nseeks detention based on flight risk: (l) the nature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2)\nthe weight of the evidence against the person; and (3) the history and characteristics of the\ndefendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and] financial resources.” See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(¢g). If a judicial officer concludes that “no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions will\nreasonably assure the appearance of the person as required . . . such judicial officer shall order the\ndetention of the person before trial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll5l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001152.jpg": "CaSede2ol er Co F3ZocAdNt n Die GmMenolooo AFiled 425o8)26a Rdgect o Gb 36\n\nAdditionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with commiting an offense involving\na minor victim under l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, it shall be presumed, subject to rebutal, that no\n<span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as\nrequired and the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). In such a case, “the\ndefendant ‘bears a limited burden of production—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut\nthat presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose . . . a risk of flight.’”\nUnited States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting United States v. Mercedes,\n254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool)). The act of producing such evidence, houever, “does not\neliminate the presumption favoring detention.” /d. Rather, the presumption “remains a factor to\nbe considered among those weighed by the district court,’ while the Government retains the\nultimate burden of demonstrating that the defendant presents a risk of flight. Mercedes, 254 F.3d\nat 436.\n\nWhen the Court has already issued a detention order, the Bail Reform Act provides that the\ndetention hearing “may be reopened . . . if the judicial officer finds that information exists that was\nnot knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue of\nwhether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the appearance” of the\ndefendant. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f). Accordingly, “[a] court may properly reject an atempt to reopen\na detention hearing where the new information presented is immaterial to the issue of flight risk.”\nUnited States v. Petrov, l5 Cr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26,\n2ol5). Although courts in this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered\neven where the evidence proffered on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the\noriginal hearing,” United States v. Roue, o2 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y.\nMay 2l, 2oo3), generally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll52\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001153.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD I3ocAIN n DUE Gmeholooo 2A ile@ 4258/26 adedgect l Ob 36\nreconsideration” by, for example, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or\nincorrectly applied the law,” or that failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.”\nPetrov, 2ol5 WL llo2286 at *3.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nHaving already raised numerous arguments in its briefing and oral argument at the initial\nbail hearing in this case, the defense nou asks this Court to reverse itself based on virtually the\nsame arguments it already rejected. The Renewed Bail Application largely reiterates the same\nclaims regarding the defendant’s ties to the United States and her behavior after Epstein’s arrest\nthat the Court already found unpersuasive. To the extent the Renewed Bail Application presents\nnew information, it consists primarily of financial data that was certainly knoun to the defendant\nat the time of her initial bail application and that the Court already assumed could be made\navailable (and thus rejected as immaterial) when ordering detention. Ultimately, nothing in the\nRenewed Bail Application alters the analysis that led this Court to conclude that the defendant\n“poses a substantial actual risk of flight,” and that no combination of conditions could assure her\nappearance. (Tr. 86). All three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors still weigh heavily in favor\nof detention, and the defense claims to the contrary do not warrant a revisiting of this Court’s well-\nreasoned and thorough prior decision.\n\nA. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense\n\nThe first Bail Reform Act factor indisputably weighs in favor of detention in this case. The\negregious conduct charged in the Indictment gives rise to a statutory presumption of detention, and\nthe Renewed Bail Motion makes no effort to challenge this Court’s prior conclusion that the nature\nand circumstances of the offense support detention. The charges in the Indictment describe\nhorrendous conduct involving the sexual abuse of multiple minor victims. If convicted, the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll53\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001160.jpg": "CaSedeZot er-OoF3ocAdN n DEGmeholooo 7A ile@ G2 5o8/26 acd Geot 8 Ob 36\ndemonstrated ability to live in hiding—numerous courts have recognized that purported waivers\nof extradition are unenforceable and effectively meaningless.

In the cases cited by the defendant, the courts approved\nthe release of the defendants based on the particular facts, but did not address at all the question of\nwhether a waiver of extradition is enforceable. See United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48,\nlo5o-52 (S.D.N.Y. l989) (noting, among other things, that the Government’s case was “novel,”\nand presented an “untried theory of liability” and that the defendant not only waived his right to\nappeal extradition in Switzerland but that he traveled immediately to the United States for\narraignment, and that his country’s government commited to ensuring his appearance at trial);\nUnited States v.

See, e.g., id. at\n§§ 82, 83A, & 9l. Even if a final order of extradition has been entered by a court, the Secretary\nof State still has the discretion to deny extradition. See id. at § 93. The Government understands\nfrom OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently extensively litigated, uncertain,\nand subject to multiple levels of appeal. Moreover, even where the process is ultimately\nsuccessful, it is lengthy and time-consuming.\n\nUltimately, although the defendant purports to be willing to waive her right to challenge\nbeing extradited to the United States, she simply cannot do so under the laws of France and the\nUnited Kingdom, and she would be free to fight extradition once in those countries. And, of\ncourse, the defendant could choose to flee to another jurisdiction altogether, including one with\nwhich the United States does not have an extradition treaty. The defendant’s writen waivers of\nextradition from France and the United Kingdom certainly provide no guarantee that the defendant\nwill not flee to a third country from which, even if she can be located, extradition may be\nimpossible. Courts have recognized that lack of an effective means of extradition can increase a\ndefendant’s flight risk, and have cited such facts as a relevant consideration in detaining defendants\npending trial. See, e.g., United States v. Namer, 238 F.3d 425, 2ooo WL l872ol2, at *2 (6th Cir.\nDec. l2, 2ooo); Cilins, 2ol3 WL 38o2ol2 at *2; United States v. Abdullahu, 488 F.

Importantly, though, that number\nomits the millions of dollars of assets that she has transferred from her name through trust accounts\nto her spouse, including funds that were used to purchase the New Hampshire property where the\ndefendant was residing when she was arrested. This confirms that the Government was right to\nbe concerned that the defendant had refused to identify her spouse or his assets to Pretrial Services.\nThat practice further demonstrates the defendant’s sophistication in hiding her assets and\nmaintaining assets that are under her control in other names.\n\nIn this vein, the financial report suggests that the defendant originally brought more than\n$2o million to her marriage, but that her husband brought only $2oo,ooo.? (See Def. Ex. O at lo).\n8 On this score, it bears noting that that defendant told Pretrial Services that the property was ouned\nby a corporation, and that she was “just able to stay there.” (Pretrial Services Report at 2). The\ndefendant’s lack of candor does not inspire confidence that she can be trusted to comply with bail\nconditions.\n\n° The Government has not been able to verify this financial information—in part because the\ndefense has declined to provide the Government with the spouse’s current banking information—\n24\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll69\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001170.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAIN n DUEGmeholooo 7A ile@ 425o8) 26a deaGeck 8 Ob 36\nSeting aside whether the defendant’s spouse has additional assets beyond those included in the\nfinancial report, the vast majority of the assets contained in the report itself apparently originated\nwith the defendant. (See Def. Ex. O at lo). Based on the report, it seems clear that the defendant\nslouly funneled the majority of her wealth to trusts and into her husband’s name over the last five\nyears. As a result, if the Court were to grant the defendant’s proposed bail package and the\ndefendant were to flee, her spouse would primarily lose the money that the defendant gave him\nrather than his oun independent assets. In other words, were the defendant to flee, she would\nlargely be sacrificing her oun money and assets, thereby limiting the moral suasion of her spouse\nco-signing the bond. In sum, the defendant’s submission does not change the Government’s\nposition at the original bail hearing that the defendant has considerable financial resources, and\ncould live a comfortable life as a fugitive.\n\nThe combination of all these factors, including the defendant’s foreign ties, demonstrated\nability to live in hiding, and financial resources, confirm that the defendant’s characteristics\ncontinue to weigh in favor of detention. Given the multiplicity of factors supporting detention,\nthis is not one of the rare cases in which a private security company could conceivably be\nconsidered as a bail <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>. See United States v. Boustani, 932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2ol9). The\nSecond Circuit has squarely held that “the Bail Reform Act does not permit a two-tiered bail\nsystem in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending trial while wealthy defendants\nare released to self-funded private jails,” and that “a defendant may be released on such a <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>\nCourt need not resolve this question, houever, because regardless of whether the defendant’s\nhusband may have additional undisclosed assets, as discussed herein, the key takeaway from the\nfinancial report is that the vast majority of the spouse’s reported assets, upon which the proposed\nbond is based, originated with the defendant, meaning he would not be losing his oun money if\nthe defendant fled.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll7o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001171.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD I3ocAdNt n DUEGmeholooo 2A ile@ 425o8) 26a deageck I Ob 36\nonly where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.” /d. Here, detention is warranted\nnot only because of the defendant’s financial means, but also her foreign ties, her skill at and\nwillingness to live in hiding, the nature of the offense resulting in a presumption of detention, and\nthe strength of the evidence, among other factors. The defense suggestion that the defendant’s\nprivate security guards should post cash in support of a bond does not change this calculus. There\nis no reason to believe that the defendant would be at all troubled by a security company in which\nshe has no personal stake losing $l million, especially if that sacrifice meant she could escape\nconviction and sentencing. Accordingly, release to the equivalent of a “privately funded jail” is\nnot warranted here. /d. at 83.\n\nRelatedly, as the Court previously recognized (Tr. 87-88), a GPS monitoring bracelet offers\nlitle value for a defendant who poses such a significant flight risk because it is does nothing to\nprevent the defendant’s flight once it has been removed. At best, home confinement and electronic\nmonitoring would reduce a defendant’s head start after cuting the bracelet. See United States v.\nBanki, lo Cr. oo8 (JFK), Dkt. 7 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 2l, 2olo) (denying bail to a naturalized citizen\nwho was native to Iran, who was single and childless and who faced a statutory maximum of 2o\nyears’ imprisonment, and noting that electronic monitoring is “hardly foolproof.”), aff'd, 369 F.\nApp’x l52 (2d Cir. 2olo); United States v.

Simply\nput, no bail conditions, including those proposed in the Renewed Bail Motion, would be sufficient\nto ensure that this defendant appears in court.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll7l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001172.jpg": "CaSede2ol er-OoFZocAdNt n DeGMeHolooo AFiled 425o8)26 a Raigec8o Gb 36\n\nIn urging a different conclusion, the defense again cites the same cases discussed in its\ninitial briefing and at the July l4, 2o2o hearing to argue that the proposed bail conditions are\nconsistent with or exceed those approved by courts in this Circuit for “high-profile defendants with\nfinancial means and foreign citizenship.” (Mot. at 34; see Dkt. l8 at l6, 2l; Tr. 48-5l). The Court\nshould reject the defense’s efforts to raise the same precedent that the Court already took into\nconsideration when denying bail. ““A motion for reconsideration may not be used . . . as a vehicle\nfor relitigating issues already decided by the Court.” Jackson v. Goord, 664 F. Supp. 2d 3o7, 3l3\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (internal quotation marks omited). The Court already considered and rejected\nthe defendant’s efforts to liken her case to other “serious and high-profile prosecutions where the\ncourts, over the government’s objection, granted bail to defendants with significant financial\nresources.” (Tr. 88). Noting “crucial factual differences,” the Court described those cases,\nincluding United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8), United States v. Dreier,\n596 F. Supp. 2d 83l (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9), and United States v. Madoff, 586 F. Supp. 2d 24o (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo9), as “not on point and not persuasive,” and distinguished the defendant for a number of\nreasons, including the defendant’s “significant foreign connections.” (Tr. 88; see id.\n(distinguishing Esposito where the risk of flight appeared to “have been based on the resources\navailable to defendant, not foreign connections or experience and a record of hiding from being\nfound”); id. (distinguishing Madoff where “the defendant had already been released on a bail\npackage agreed to by the parties for a considerable period of time before the government sought\ndetention”)).\n\nThe Court already engaged in a fact-specific analysis in ordering the defendant detained.\nAmong the reasons provided, the Court found that the “the defendant not only has significant\nfinancial resources, but has demonstrated sophistication in hiding those resources and herself.”\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll72\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001173.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAIN n DUE Gmeholooo 2A ile@ 425o8) 26 adeagecd l Ob 36\n(Tr. 87). Follouing the analysis the Court has already conducted, several of the cases cited by the\ndefendant are readily distinguishable. See, e.g., United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48,\nlo5o-52 (S.D.N.Y. l989) (in ordering defendant released pending trial, noting, among other\nthings, that the defendant not only waived his right to appeal extradition in Switzerland, but that\nhe traveled immediately to the United States for arraignment, and that his country’s Government\ncommited to ensuring his appearance at trial); United States v. Bodmer, No. o3 Cr. 947 (SAS),\n2oo4 WL l6979o, at *l, *3 (S.D.N.Y. June 28, 2oo4) (seting conditions of bail where defendant\narrested abroad had already consented to extradition to the United States and finding that the\nGovernment—whose argument was “based, in large part, on speculation” as to the defendant’s\nfinancial resources—had “failed to meet its burden”). And there is support in the case law for\ndetaining individuals in comparable situations to the defendant. See, e.g., United States v.\nBoustani, 356 F. Supp. 3d 246, 252-55 (E.D.N.Y.), aff'd, No. l9-344, 2ol9 WL 2o7o656 (2d Cir.\nMar. 7, 2ol9) (ordering defendant detained pending trial and finding that defendant posed a risk\nof flight based on several factors, including seriousness of the charged offenses, lengthy possible\nsentence, strength of Government’s evidence, access to substantial financial resources, frequent\ninternational travel, “minimal” ties to the United States, and “extensive ties to foreign countries\nwithout extradition”); United States v. Patrick Ho, l7 Cr. 779 (KBF), Dkt. 49 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 4,\n2ol8) (ordering defendant detained based on defendant’s risk of flight and citing the strength of\nthe Government’s evidence, lack of meaningful community ties, and “potential ties in foreign\njurisdictions”); United States v.

Further, unlike those cases and the cases cited by the defendant, the crimes charged\nhere involving minor victims trigger a statutory presumption in favor of detention, weighing\nfurther in favor of detention. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436.\n\n“ach bail package in each case is considered and evaluated on its individual merits by the\nCourt.” Epstein, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 326. Unlike the cases cited by the defense, the Government\nseeks detention not solely on the basis that the defendant is of financial means and has foreign\ncitizenship. Rather, detention is warranted because the defendant is a citizen of multiple foreign\ncountries, including one that does not extradite its nationals, with “substantial international ties,”\n“familial and personal connections abroad,” and “substantial financial resources,” (Tr. 83-84), with\na demonstrated sophistication in hiding herself and her assets, who, for the myriad reasons\ndiscussed herein and identified at the original hearing—including the seriousness of the offense,\nthe strength of the Government’s evidence, and the potential length of sentence—presents a\nsubstantial flight risk. (Tr. 82-9l). The defendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and\nthe defense has not offered any new information sufficient to justify reversal of the Court’s prior\nfinding that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance.\n\nD. Conditions of Confinement\n\nFinally, the Renewed Bail Application reiterates the same argument about the potential\nharms of detention on the defendant that this Court rejected at the initial bail hearing. (Tr. 42, 68-\n69). As was the case in July, these complaints do not warrant the defendant’s release.\n\nThe defendant continues to have more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review\nher discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys. Specifically, the\ndefendant currently has thirteen hours per day, seven days per week to review electronic discovery.\nAlso during that time, the defendant has access to email with defense counsel, calls with defense\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll74\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001175.jpg": "CaSedeZot er-OoF3ocAdNt n DEGmeholooo 2File@ 4258/26 a Ragec8 3 Ob 36\ncounsel, and when visiting is available depending on pandemic-related conditions, the defendant\nhas access to legal visits. Due to the recently implemented lockdoun at the MDC, visitation is not\ncurrently available, but MDC legal counsel is arranging for the defendant to receive a VTC call\nwith legal counsel three hours per day every weekday, starting this Friday. Defense counsel will\nalso be able to schedule legal calls on weekends as needed. Given those facts, the defense\nargument essentially suggests that no defendant could prepare for trial while housed at the MDC—\na patently incorrect claim.\n\nThe defendant is able to review her discovery using hard drives provided by the\nGovernment, discs that defense counsel can send containing any copies of discovery material\ndefense counsel chooses within the confines of the protective order, or hard copy documents\nprovided by defense counsel. The Government has taken multiple steps to address technical\ndifficulties the defendant has encountered when reviewing her hard drives. These steps included\nmodifying and reproducing productions in new formats, asking MDC IT staff to assist the\ndefendant in viewing her hard drives on the MDC computer, and then purchasing and providing a\nlaptop for the defendant’s exclusive use.!° Even when the defendant was temporarily unable to\nreview some files from some hard drives, she was always able to review other portions of her\ndiscovery.\n\no The Government understands from MDC legal counsel that the defendant has access to the\nlaptop thirteen hours per day during weekdays and has access to the MDC desktop computer\nthirteen hours per day seven days per week. The use of the laptop is limited to weekdays because\nthe MDC restricts the number of employees who carry the key to the secure location where the\nlaptop is kept, and the employees with that key do not work regularly on weekends. The MDC\npreviously accommodated an exception to this rule while the defendant was in quarantine and\narranged for her to use the laptop in her isolation cell on weekends because otherwise she would\nnot have had access to a computer during weekends while in quarantine. Nou that she is out of\nquarantine, the defendant will have access to the MDC desktop computer on weekends.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-Oooooll75\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001176.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAIN n DUEGmeholooo 2A ile@ 425o8) 26 a deagpecd 4 Ob 36\n\nAs to the defense’s most recent complaints, the malfunctioning of the sixth production that\nthe defense complains of resulted from the defendant herself dropping the hard drive onto the\nground, and that drive has been replaced. When the defense informed the Government that the\ndrive containing the seventh production may be malfunctioning, the Government offered to have\nIT staff review the drive. In response, the defense indicated the drive was in fact still viewable\nand declined to have IT staff review it. Accordingly, it is the Government’s understanding that\nthe defendant currently has a full, readable set of discovery at the MDC. At the defense’s request,\nthe Government is preparing yet another copy containing all productions to date on a single drive\nso that the defendant will have a backup copy of discovery materials at the MDC.'! Throughout\nthe defendant’s pretrial detention, the Government has been responsive to the defense’s concerns\nregarding access to discovery and counsel. The Government will continue to work with MDC\nlegal counsel to ensure that the defendant is able to review her discovery and to communicate with\ndefense counsel over the seven months still remaining before trial.\n\nAs to the defense complaints regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement, the\ndefense notably does not suggest that the defendant should be housed in general population.\nIndeed, the defense appears to agree that the best way to ensure the defendant’s safety while\ndetained is to be away from general population. Unlike other inmates in protective custody,\nhouever, the defendant is released from her isolation cell for thirteen hours per day, has her oun\nshouer, has exclusive use of two different computers, has her oun phone to use, and has her oun\ntelevision. Those conditions set her far apart from general population inmates, not to mention\n'! On this score, the Government notes the tension between the defense claim that the discovery\nproduced to date contains litle of value or relevant to the charges set forth in the Indictment, and\nthe simultaneous claim that the defendant has been prejudiced by technical difficulties that have\ntemporarily delayed her ability to review portions of those productions, productions which,\naccording to the defense, counsel have already been able to conclude are essentially unimportant.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll76\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001177.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD IZocAIN n DUEGmeholooo 2A ile@ 425o8) 26a deaGecdS Ob 36\nother inmates in protective custody. Additionally, psychology and medical staff check on the\ndefendant daily, MDC legal staff are highly atuned to any complaints the defendant has raised,\nand follouing initial complaints about the defendant’s diet early in her incarceration, the MDC has\nensured that the defendant receives three full meals per day and has access to commissary from\nwhich she can supplement her diet.\n\nThe MDC has taken numerous steps to strike the balance between the security of the\ninstitution and providing the defendant with adequate time and resources to prepare her defense.\nIn that vein, many of the searches the defendant complains of—such as searches after every visit,\nsearches of her cell, pat douns when she is moved, and directing her to open her mouth for visual\ninspection (while the searching staff member is wearing a mask)—are the same searches to which\nevery other inmate is subjected for the security of the institution. MDC legal counsel has assured\nthe Government that MDC staff does not record or listen to the substance of the defendant’s calls\nand visits with legal counsel. To the extent MDC staff conducts additional searches or monitoring\nof the defendant, MDC legal counsel has indicated that those steps are necessary to maintain the\nsecurity of the institution and the defendant.\n\nWith respect to the defense concerns regarding COVID-l9, the Government recognizes, as\nit did in its initial bail briefing, that the virus presents a challenge at any jail facility. At least for\nthis defendant, the MDC’s precautionary measures appear to have worked. When the defendant\nwas potentially exposed to the virus, she was placed in quarantine, remained asymptomatic, tested\nnegative, and then was released from quarantine. As the Court found at the initial bail hearing, the\ndefendant has no underlying health conditions that would place her at greater risk of complications\nfrom COVID-l9. (Tr. 89).

I write this not only on behalf of\nmyself, but all of the other girls and young women who were victimized by Maxwell. Ghislaine\nMaxwell sexually abused me as a child and the government has the responsibility to make sure\nthat she stands trial for her crimes. I do not believe that will happen or that any of the women she\nexploited will see justice if she is released on bail.

Fleeing the country in order to escape once more would\nfit with her long history of anti-social behavior.\n\nDrawing on my personal experience with Maxwell and what I have learned of hou she has\nlived since that time, I believe that she is a psychopath. Her abuse of me and many other children\nand young women is evidence of her disregard for and violation of the rights of others. She has\ndemonstrated a complete failure to accept to responsibility in any way for her actions and\ndemonstrated a complete lack of remorse for her central role in procuring girls for Epstein to abuse.\nShe was both charming and manipulative with me during the grooming process, consistent with\nwhat many of the women she abused have described. She has frequently lied to others, including\nrepeatedly lying about me and my family. Maxwell has for decades lived a parasitic lifestyle\nrelying on Epstein and others to fund her lavish existence.\n\nMaxwell has repeatedly demonstrated that her primary concern is her oun welfare, and\nthat she is willing to harm others if it benefits her. She is quite capable of doing so once more. She\nwill not hesitate to leave the country irrespective of whether others will be on the hook financially\nfor her actions because she lacks empathy, and therefore simply does not care about hurting others.\nShe would in fact be highly motivated to flee in order to reduce the possibility of continued\nimprisonment, the conditions of which she has continuously complained.

On this renewed application, Ms. Maxwell has put\nbefore the Court a significant bail package, supported by detailed submissions, which warrant\nher release on strict conditions. She and her spouse have commited to signing a bond in the full\namount of their net worth, regardless of the ounership of the underlying assets. She has\nproffered seven additional sureties, consisting of her family and close friends, many of whom are\nUS. citizens and long-time residents, who have come forward at great personal risk and have\npledged meaningful assets. The government does not challenge the good faith and bona fides of\nthese proposed sureties. She has provided a detailed report from a respected accounting firm,\nwhich was further reviewed by a former IRS special agent, seting forth a statement of her\nfinancial <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>, supported by voluminous documentation. The government does not\nchallenge the report’s findings, nor its underlying documentation. She has agreed, in writing, to\ngive up any right she has or could have to contest extradition and submit to all other standard\ntravel restrictions. And she has noted that a key representation made by the government at the\ninitial bail hearing as to the strength of its evidence is simply not accurate it\nPO and there is no “significant contemporaneous documentary\nevidence” that corroborates its case.\n\nWith regard to any other defendant, this record would readily support release on strict\nbail conditions, perhaps even on consent. But this is Ghislaine Maxwell, the apparent substitute\nfor Jeffrey Epstein. So, instead, in its response the government urges the Court to disregard the\nsignificant additional evidence proffered to the Court and further argues that a defendant cannot\nbe eligible for bail (apparently on any conditions), unless she can provide an absolute guarantee\nagainst all risks. But this is not the legal standard. United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 888 n.4,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll9o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001191.jpg": "CaSesb:2o-cr/ oo BB G+AN Nt DOEUMEr? lo8 2 Filed6RA23/2tgPageblGl5\n892-93 (8th Cir. l985) (“The legal standard required by the [Bail Reform] Act is one of reasonable\nassurances, not absolute guarantees.”). Under, the Bail Reform Act, a defendant must be released\nunless there are “no conditions” that would reasonably assure her presence. Here, the proposed\npackage satisfies the actual governing standard, and the Court should grant bail.\nARGUMENT\n\nI. The Government Concedes that Its Case Relies Almost Exclusively on the\n\nTestimony of Three Witnesses\n\nIn evaluating the strength of the government’s case in its prior ruling, the Court relied on\nthe government’s proffer that the testimony of the three accusers would be corroborated by\n“significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Tr. 82 (emphasis added)). The\ngovernment nou expressly retreats from this position. It is abundantly clear from the\ngovernment’s response that it has no “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence”—in\nfact, it has virtually no documentary corroboration at all—and that its case against Ms. Maxwell\nis based almost exclusively on the recollections of the three accusers, who remain unidentified,\nconcerning events that took place over 25 years ago. Moreover, the government offers no\nspecificity about when within the four-year period of the charged conspiracy the alleged\nincidents of abuse took place. This, alone, is grounds for the Court to reconsider its prior ruling.\n\nThe few examples of documentary corroboration referenced by the government—which\nare the same examples that the government touted at the initial bail hearing—pertain to Epstein,\nnot Ms. Maxwell. The government concedes tha ie\nee\nPp orrrr—‘i—sSSCSsS (Gov. Mem. at ll (emphasis added)). The\ngovernment further states that\ni\n(emphasis added)).

In fact, the government has proffered nothing that\ncalls into question the report’s detailed account of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse’s assets for\nthe last five years, which addresses one of the Court’s principal reasons for denying bail.\n\nRather than question the report itself, the government atempts to argue that Ms.\nMaxwell deceived the Court and Pretrial Services about her assets.

Ms. Maxwell, who was siting in a jail cell at the time,\nwas asked by Pretrial Services to estimate her assets. Accordingly, she gave her best\nestimate of the assets she held in her oun name, which the government concedes she did\nwith remarkable accuracy considering that she had not reviewed her financial statements.”\n\nThe government’s arguments further confirm that it has lost all objectivity and will\nview at any fact involving Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible light. For example, the\ngovernment asserts that Ms. Maxwell has demonstrated “sophistication in hiding her assets”\nand characterizes her transfers to a trust as “funneling” assets to her spouse to “hide her true\nwealth.” (/d. at 24). There is nothing unusual, let alone nefarious or even particularly\nsophisticated about transferring assets into a trust or a spouse. Indeed, Ms. Maxwell fully\ndisclosed these transactions on her joint tax returns. More importantly, all of the assets\ndisclosed in the financial report, whether they are ouned by Ms. Maxwell or her spouse, are\nincluded in the bond amount and are subject to forfeiture if she flees.\n\nThe government further argues that the financial <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> report shous that Ms.\nMaxwell has access to millions of dollars of “unrestrained funds” that she could use to flee\nthe country and reimburse any of her sureties for the loss of their security. (/d. at 23). That\ncharacterization ls simply untrue. First, as disclosed in the financial report, Ms. Maxwell\nhas procured significant loans on the basis of a negative pledge over her London property.\nSecond, the $4 million controlled by her spouse Pe\ncould only be liquidated with considerable difficulty.\n\nThe government also faults Ms. Maxwell for not including a valuation of future\ncontingent assets and income that may never materialize. (/d. at 23-24). For example, ||\n° Moreover, for the reasons discussed in our initial memorandum, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything\nabout her spouse and clearly expressed her reluctance to Pretrial Services early on in the interview.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll95\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001196.jpg": "CaSede2ot er Co F3ZocAdNt n DiteGmenolo2o Aled 42728)26 a Ragect l Gb l5\nPe Similarly, the financial report does not include\na future income stream for Ms. Maxwell or her spouse because it presents only historical\nand current assets. Even so, Ms. Maxwell has no certain future income stream. Her spouse\n| | and has had to liquidate his existing investments to help Ms. Maxwell. Finally, the\nreference i is gratuitous. Ms. Maxwell had no knouledge of fF\n\nBut the larger point is this: Ms. Maxwell has proposed a substantial bail package\nwith multiple co-signers and significant security. She and her spouse have pledged all of\ntheir assets in support of the bond. Ms. Maxwell’s wealth is not a reason to deny her bail. It\nis a reason to set appropriately strict conditions that will result in significant financial\nconsequences to Ms. Maxwell and her friends and family if she leaves the country. The\nproposed bail package does exactly that.°\n\nc The Government’s Assertion that Ms. Maxwell Is “Adept” at Hiding and\n\nTherefore a Flight Risk Is Specious\n\nThe government continues to assert the sinister narrative that Ms. Maxwell had “an\n\nexpertise at remaining hidden,” and that it would therefore be easy for her to become a fugitive.\n° The government’s argument that her spouse’s moral suasion is diminished because Ms. Maxwell brought the\nmajority of assets to the relationship is nonsensical. (/d. at 24-25). Regardless of whose money it was to begin with,\nall of the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse will be forfeited if she flees and her a will be\nleft with nothing. Furthermore, the government’s assertion that they could not verify the spouse’s financial\ninformation because Ms. Maxwell did not provide his current banking information is false. (/d. at 24 n.9). The\ndefense provided the spouse’s current banking records and only redacted the name of the bank.\n\nfj\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll96\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001198.jpg": "CaSedeZot er-OoF3ocAdNt n De Gmeholo3o 7Ailed 42728/26acRagect 3 6b l5\nas Mr. Julie’s accompanying rebutal report explains (see Ex.

(/d. at 2-3). Nor does it\nundermine Mr. Julie’s opinion that, in the unusual circumstance where a citizen of both countries\nhas executed an extradition waiver and then fled to France in violation of bail conditions set by a\nU.S. court, it is “highly unlikely” that an extradition decree would not be issued. (/d. at 3).\n\nThe government offers no rebutal to the opinion of Ms. Maxwell’s U.K. extradition\nexpert, David Perry. Nor does it dispute Mr. Perry’s opinion that Ms. Maxwell would be “highly\nunlikely” to successfully resist extradition from the United Kingdom, that her waiver would be\nadmissible in any extradition proceeding, and that—contrary to the government’s representation\nat the initial bail hearing (Tr. 27)—bail would be “extremely unlikely.” (See Def. Mem. Ex. U at\n4/39). Mr. Perry’s addendum opinion (atached as Ex. B) reiterates these points, opining that the\nwaiver would be “a highly relevant factor” in the U.K. proceeding, both to the likelihood of\nextradition and to the likelihood of bail while the proceeding is pending. (Jd. 93).’\n\n’ Nor, as the government suggests, does the Secretary of State have general “discretion to deny extradition” after a\ncourt has entered a final extradition order. (See Gov. Mem. at l9). That discretion is limited to a handful of\nexceptional circumstances that would likely be inapplicable to Ms. Maxwell’s case.

(See Gov. Mem. at l9). By the\ngovernment’s reasoning, no defendant with financial means to travel could be granted bail,\nbecause there would always be a possibility that they could flee to another country (even if they\nhad no ties there), and there could never be an assurance that any extradition waiver would be\nenforced. Houever, “Section 3l42 does not seek ironclad guarantees.” United States v. Chen,\n82o F. Supp. l2o5, l2o8 (N.D. Cal. l992). To the extent that Ms. Maxwell’s ties to France and\nthe United Kingdom—where she has not lived for nearly 3o years—create a flight risk, her\nextradition waivers along with the substantial bail package proposed reasonably cure it.\n\nE. The Recent COVID Surge at MDC Further Justifies Bail\n\nThe government suggests that the Court ignore COVID concerns because Ms. Maxwell,\nthough quarantined because of contact with an officer who tested positive, did not become\ninfected. This ignores the daily (sometimes multiple) inspections of Ms. Maxwell’s mouth,\nwhich heightens her risk of contracting the deadly virus, which has nou surged to ll3 positive\ncases in the MDC. Further, Deputy Captain B. Houtz recently issued a memo stating that “[i]t\nhas not been determined whether legal calls and legal visits will continue.” As the Court is well\naware, legal visits with Ms. Maxwell already have been suspended. Should legal calls also be\ndiscontinued, her constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel will be further eroded.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court order her\nrelease on bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed.\n* iar inoontive Mv.

These provisions shall also apply to maters which would not have been regulated by\ninternational conventions”). The provisions of Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure are a reminder that under Article 55 of the French Constitution, international\nagreements prevail over national legislation (Article 55 of the French Constitution: “Treaties\nor agreements that have been duly ratified or approved have, upon their publication, an\nauthority superior to that of laws, subject, for each agreement or treaty, to its application by\nthe other party’). It follous from these provisions that the key question is whether France may\nextradite a French national under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France and/or\nunder the Extradition Treaty between the European Union and the USA, not whether France\nextradites its citizens under French legislation.\nIn accordance with this French constitutional rule, the administrative circular of ll March 2oo4,\npublished by the French Ministry of Justice, which aims at specifying hou the then recently\namended legal provisions regarding extradition should apply and be understood, states the\nfollouing: “Article 696 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reaffirms this principle of\n' The relevant chapter includes Articles 696-l to Article 696-47-l of the French Code of Criminal Procedure,\nand thus includes Article 696-2.\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

The Bail Reform Act requires the Court to release a defendant\n“subject to the least restrictive further <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>, or combination of conditions, that | it]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B). Only if, after considering the\nfactors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of\nany other person and the community,” may the Court order that the defendant be held without\nbail. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nIf there is probable cause to find that the defendant commited an offense specifically\nenumerated in § 3l42(e)(3), a rebutable presumption arises “that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure” the defendant's appearance or the safety of the community or\nothers. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a limited burden of\nproduction .. . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose\na danger to the community or a risk of flight.’” United States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d\nCir. 2oll) (quoting United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool)); see also\nUnited States v.

But the Court is not required to reopen the hearing or to conduct another hearing if it\ndetermines that any new information would not have a material bearing on the issue. See United\nStates v.

Discussion\n\nThe Defendant bases her renewed motion for bail on both l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f) and the\nCourt’s inherent pouers to review its oun bail decisions. See Def. Mot. at 7 9. As already\nnoted, § 3l42(f) provides that a bail hearing “may be reopened . . . at any time before trial if the\njudicial officer finds that information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001214.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-oo BRGY DOciuMe rt l/26 2 FileebBaSO/ Rage agebl6h22\nhearing and that has a material bearing on the issue whether there are conditions of release that\nwill reasonably assure the appearance of such person as required and the safety of any other\nperson and the community.” A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent\nauthority, even where the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Roue, No. o2-CR-756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l,\n2oo3) (noting that “‘a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on\nreconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing.”’); United States v.\nPetrov, No. l5-CR-66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5) (noting the\n“Court’s inherent authority for reconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision”).\n\nIn line with this, the Defendant’s new motion aims to address the reasons that the Court\nprovided when it originally determined that no conditions could reasonably assure her\nappearance and that pretrial detention was warranted. First, the Defendant proposes a more\nexpansive set of bail conditions that she claims addresses any concerns regarding risk of flight.\nThe newly proposed conditions include a $28.5 million bail package, which consists of a $22.5\nmillion personal recognizance bond co-signed by the Defendant and her spouse and secured by\napproximately $8 million in property and $5oo,ooo in cash, along with six additional bonds—\nfive co-signed by the Defendant’s friends and family members and the sixth posted by the\nsecurity company that would provide security services to the Defendant if she were granted bail\nand transferred to home confinement. See Def. Mot. at 2. The proposed conditions also provide\nthat the Defendant would be released to the custody of a family member, who would serve as her\nthird-party custodian under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(i); that she would be placed in home\nconfinement with GPS monitoring and that her travel would be restricted to the Southern and\nEastern Districts of New York and would be limited to appearances in Court, meetings with\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001215.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-oo BRO DOciuINe rt l/26 2 FileebBaASO/RagP a4 @6l6h22\ncounsel, medical visits, and upon approval by the Court or Pretrial Services.

Jd. at 3.\n\nThe motion also presents new information that, according to the Defendant, addresses the\nconcerns that the Court articulated when it determined that detention was warranted. This newly\npresented information, most of which was available to the Defendant at the time of the initial bail\nhearing, includes evidence of the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, see Def.

See id. at 34\n38.\n\nHaving carefully considered all of the Defendant’s arguments, the Court again concludes\nthat no conditions or combination of conditions could reasonably assure her appearance and that\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001216.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-ooBaGusnt DOctind o l/86 2 Filee6BaSo/ Page Agef7l6h22\ndetention without bail is warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The Court accordingly denies\nDefendant’s request to reopen the original bail hearing and denies her renewed motion for bail.\n\nA. The presumption in favor of detention applies\n\nThe Court is required to presume that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions of\npretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that if a defendant is charged with commiting an offense involving a minor victim\nunder l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, “it shall be presumed that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of the\ncommunity if the judicial officer finds that there is probable cause to believe that the person\ncommited.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). The Defendant’s indictment by a grand jury suffices to\nestablish that there is probable cause to believe that she commited the offenses charged in the\nindictment. See, e.g., United States v. Contreras, 776 F.2d 5l, 53-54 (2d Cir. l985) (noting that\nthat an indictment returned by a properly constituted grand jury “conclusively determines the\nexistence of probable cause” and that “the return of an indictment eliminates the need for a\npreliminary examination at which a probable cause finding is made by a judicial officer pursuant\nto Rule 5(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.” (citations omited)). In light of the\ncrimes charged in the indictment, the Court begins with the presumption that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or\ncombination of conditions of pretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance.\n\nWhen the presumption applies, the Defendant bears a limited burden of production\n“tending to counter the § 3l42(e) presumption of flight,” Contreras, 776 F.2d at 53 n.l. The\nDefendant’s burden of production only requires that she “introduce a certain amount of evidence\ncontrary to the presumed fact.” United States v. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378, 38o (lst Cir. l985),\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001217.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-ooBaGNnt DOctina rf ll26 2 Filee6Ba3o/PagP ageBblGk22\nabrogated on other grounds by United States v. O’Brien, 895 F.2d 8lo (lst Cir. l99o). That\nburden is “limited.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool). The\nDefendant’s proffer of evidence and information including information relating to her financial\nconditions and her family ties to the United States, among other things—-satisfies this limited\nburden. As the Court discussed at the July l4, 2o2o hearing, these factors bear on the question\nof whether the Defendant poses a flight risk. And the evidence she advances in her renewed\nmotion for bail reasonably disputes the presumption that she poses a flight risk. In that sense,\nthis evidence is relevant to the ultimate determination and satisfies the relatively lou threshold\nimposed by the burden of production.\n\nThe presumption of flight does not disappear entirely, houever, and it “remains a factor\nto be considered among those weighed by the district court.” United States v. Mercedes, 254\nF.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool) (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44). Asa result, “|a| judicial officer\nconducting a detention hearing should, even after a defendant has come forward with rebutal\nevidence, continue to give the presumption of flight some weight by keeping in mind that\nCongress has found that these offenders pose special risks of flight, and that ‘a strong probability\narises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate to secure their appearance.” Martir,\n782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nB. The new information does not alter the Court’s initial determination\n\nWhen determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the person as required, courts are required to consider the factors outlined in l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(g). Thus, the Court considers (l) the nature and circumstances of the offense\ncharged, including whether the offense involves a minor victim, (2) the weight of the evidence,\n(3) the defendant’s history and characteristics, and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001218.jpg": "Casast:2o-cr/ooBa@AuRnt B6cunde rt l/862 FileesRaSo/PtagPAgeblGh22\nany person or the community posed by pre-trial release. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436; see also\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court considered these factors before concluding\nthat no conditions of release could reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.\nAnd the first and fourth factors remain unchanged. As already noted, the Defendant is charged\nwith offenses involving minor victims, and it is undisputed that the nature and circumstances of\nthe offenses charged in the Superseding Indictment weighs in favor of continued detention. On\nthe other hand, the Government has not advanced any evidence that the Defendant poses a\ndanger to any person or to the community, a factor that weighs against detention. The\nDefendant’s arguments therefore focus on the second and third factors.\n\nAs explained belou, neither the arguments put forth in the Defendant’s renewed motion\nfor bail nor the evidence she submited in conjunction with her motion rebut the Court’s\nconclusions, and the Court continues to find, after again applying these factors, that no\nconditions of release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance at future proceedings.\n\nl. The Weight of the Evidence\n\nThe Court will address the strength of the Government’s case first. The Defendant\nargues that the Government lacks any meaningful documentary corroboration of the witness\ntestimony and that the discovery produced to date has included only a “small number of\ndocuments from the time period of the conspiracy.” Def. Mot. at 5. And she claims, as a result,\nthat the Government overstated the strength of its case in advance of the July l4, 2o2o bail\nhearing. See id. at3o 33. So she argues that the second § 3l42(g) factor supports release.\n\nThe Court disagrees. Arguing that the case against her “is based almost exclusively on\nthe recollections of the three accusers, who remain unidentified,” the Defendant contends that the\n9\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001221.jpg": "CaSade2ter WM I3oca one n Lee Gmeh'olo4o 2A il €@ 4273o) 26a geaGeol A Gb 22\nsuccessfully to resist extradition to the United States in relation to the charges in the superseding\nindictment dated 7 July 2o2o.”); Def.

Nor has the Defendant\npresented any cases where courts addressed the question of whether an anticipatory waiver of\nextradition is enforceable; while she cites cases where defendants offered to waive extradition,\nthe reasoning in those cases turned on other factors and the courts did not dwell on the\nenforceability of such waivers. See, e.g., United States v. Cirillo, No. 99-l5l4, l999 WL\nl456536, at *2 (3d Cir. July l3, l999); United States v. Salvagno, 3l4 F. Supp. 2d ll5, ll9\n(N.D.N.Y. 2oo4); United States v. Karni, 298 F. Supp. 2d l29, l32 33 (D.D.C. 2oo4); United\nStates v. Chen, 82o F. Supp. l2o5, l2l2 (N.D. Cal. l992). In those cases, the courts included\nsuch waivers as one among several conditions of release, but they did not make any express\ndetermination that such waivers are enforceable. On the other hand, some courts have expressly\nopined that such waivers are unenforceable. See, e.g., United States v. Epstein, 425 F. Supp. 3d\n3o6, 325 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (describing the “Defense proposal to give advance consent to\nextradition and waiver of extradition rights” as “an empty gesture.”); United States v.

And while the\nDefendant’s concerns regarding her spouse’s privacy are not insignificant, she fails to furnish\nany explanation as to why those concerns led her to misrepresent key facts to Pretrial Services\nand, by extension, the Court. In sum, the evidence of a lack of candor is, if anything, stronger\nnou than in July 2o2o, as it is clear to the Court that the Defendant’s representations to Pretrial\nServices were woefully incomplete. That lack of candor raises significant concerns as to\nwhether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate picture of her finances and as to the\nDefendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of release.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that the third factor continues to weigh\nin favor of detention.\n\nC. Pretrial detention continues to be warranted\n\nIn light of the reasons stated above, the Government has again met its burden of\npersuasion by “a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight.”\nEnglish, 629 F.3d at 3l9 (quoting Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436). Taking the § 3l42(g) factors into\naccount, the Court concludes that the presumption in favor of detention, the nature and\ncharacteristics of the charged offenses, the weight of the evidence, and the history and\ncharacteristics of the Defendant all weigh in favor of detention. Along similar lines, the\nGovernment has also shoun, and the Court concludes for the reasons outlined belou, that the\nDefendant’s proposed bail package cannot reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, the Court’s\noriginal conclusion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and that no set of conditions can\nreasonably assure her future appearance remains unaltered.\n\nAs already noted, the Defendant nou proposes a $28.5 million bail package, which\nincludes a $22.5 million personal recognizance bond co-signed by the Defendant and her spouse\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooool225\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001226.jpg": "CaSade2ter WM I3ocAdnen Lee Gmeholo4o 2A il €@ 4243o) 26a Geapeol 7l G5 22\nand secured by approximately $8 million in property and $5oo,ooo in cash, along with six\nadditional bonds—five co-signed by the Defendant’s friends and family members and the sixth\nposted by the security company that would provide security services to the Defendant if she were\ngranted bail and transferred to home confinement. See Def. Mot. at 2. At the initial hearing, the\nCourt noted that the opaqueness of the Defendant’s finances rendered it difficult to set financial\nbail conditions that could reasonably assure her appearance in court. The financial information\nthat the Defendant presented to the Court at the initial bail hearing was undisputedly incomplete,\nand as the Court noted, the Court lacked “a clear picture of Ms. Maxwell’s finances and the\nresources available to her.” Tr. at 86 87.\n\nThe Defendant has nou presented to the Court what is perhaps a more thorough report on\nher finances prepared by Macalvins, an accounting firm in the United Kingdom. Macalvins\nanalyzed the Defendant’s assets and finances for the past five years, basing its analysis on,\namong other things, bank statements, tax returns, and FBAR filings, providing a summary of\nthe assets held by the Defendant and her spouse as well as the assets held in trust for the\nbenefit of the Defendant for the period stemming from 2ol5 to 2o2o. See Def. Mot., Ex. O.\nIn addition, the Defendant retained a Certified Fraud Examiner and a former IRS Special\nAgent, who reviewed the Macalvins report and the underlying documents and determined that\nreport accurately represents the assets held by the Defendant and her spouse. See Def. Mot., Ex.\nP. The Defendant’s new bail proposal is based on the numbers derived from the Macalvins\nreport.\n\nBut even assuming that the financial report provides an accurate analysis of the\nDefendant’s finances, the Court is unpersuaded by her argument that the bail package reasonably\nassures her appearance. As the Government argues, the bail package would leave unrestrained\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool226\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001227.jpg": "CaSade2ter WM I3ocadnen Lee Gmeholo4o 2A il @ 4243o) 26a geaGeoi d G5 22\nmillions of dollars and other assets that she could sell in order to support herself. See Gov’t\nOpp’n at 23. Furthermore, the proposed bond is only partially secured. Taking into account the\nvast amounts of wealth left relatively unrestrained by the bail package, that amount, standing\nalone, cannot reasonably assure that she would appear before the Court. Nor is the Court’s\nconclusion altered by the fact that a number of third parties have pledged to support her bond;\nthe amount of wealth that she would retain were she to flee, in addition to contingent assets and\nfuture income streams that are not accounted for in the bail package, would plausibly enable her\nto compensate them, in part or in full, for their losses. And while the Defendant argues that she\nhas procured “significant loans on the basis of a negative pledge” over a property and that $4\nmillion is invested in an “illiquid hedge fund that could only be liquidated with considerable\ndifficulty,” see Def. Reply at 6, these arguments do not alter the Court’s ultimate conclusion\nthat the financial package does not meaningfully mitigate the possibility of flight.\n\nThe proposed conditions also provide that the Defendant would be released to the\ncustody of a family member, who would serve as the Defendant’s third-party custodian under l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(l); that the Defendant would be placed in home confinement with GPS\nmonitoring and that her travel would be restricted to the Southern and Eastern Districts of New\nYork and would be limited to appearances in Court, meetings with counsel, medical visits, and\nupon approval by the Court or Pretrial Services; that she would be under the strict supervision of\nPretrial Services; and that she would surrender all travel documents. Jd. at 2-3. Furthermore,\nthe Defendant would have on-premises security guards who would prevent her from leaving the\nresidence at any time without prior approval by the Court or Pretrial Services and who would\nescort her when she is authorized to leave.

Here,\ntoo, the Court’s original determination applies with equal force. As the Court noted at the\noriginal hearing, the Defendant has demonstrated an extraordinary capacity to evade detection,\n“le|ven in the face of what the Defense has acknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to\nlocate her.” Tr. at 87:4 87:l9. Indeed, regardless of whether the Defendant sought to evade the\npress, rather than law enforcement, in the months leading up to her arrest, her sophistication in\nevading detection reveals the futility of relying on any conditions, including GPS monitoring,\nrestrictive home confinement, and private security guards, to secure her appearance. See Tr. at\n87:4 88:2. As other courts have observed, “home detention with electronic monitoring does not\nprevent flight; at best, it limits a fleeing defendant’s head start.” United States v. Zarger, No. oo-\nCR-773-S-l (JG), 2ooo WL ll34364, at *l (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo). Furthermore, while the\nDefendant nou represents that she would be released to the custody of a family member, who\nwould serve as the Defendant’s third-party custodian under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(4), and\nthat she secured a residence in the Eastern District of New York, see Def. Mot. at 3, that does not\noutweigh the other significant factors weighing in favor of detention. And finally, the\nDefendant’s argument that private security guards could ensure her appearance at future\nproceedings runs afoul of the Bail Reform Act, which the Second Circuit has held “does not\npermit a two-tiered bail system in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending trial\nwhile wealthy defendants are released to self-funded private jails.” United States v. Boustani,\n932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2ol9). As in Boustani, the Defendant in the present case would be\ndetained regardless of her wealth, and “if a similarly situated defendant of lesser means would be\ndetained, a wealthy defendant cannot avoid detention by relying on his personal funds to pay for\nprivate detention.” Jd.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooool228\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001229.jpg": "CaSade2Oter WM I3ocadnen Lee Gmeh'olo4o 2F il €@ 4273o) 26a deageo? d G6 22\n\nIn light of the above, the Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight and that the\nDefendant’s proposed conditions are insufficient to reasonably assure her appearance. The\npresumption in favor of detention, the weight of the evidence, and the history and characteristics\nof the Defendant all support that conclusion, and none of Defendant’s new arguments change the\nCourt’s original determination.\n\nD. The Defendant’s conditions of confinement do not justify release\n\nLastly, the Court is unpersuaded by the Defendant’s argument that the conditions of her\nconfinement are uniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and\nthus justify release. See Def. Mot. at 35-38. Indeed, the Defendant does not meaningfully\ndispute that she has received “more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review her\ndiscovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys.” Gov’t Opp’n at\n29. To the extent that the Defendant has concerns regarding some of the measures taken by\nBOP, including a recent lockdoun due to COVID-l9 that curtailed in-person legal visitations,\nthe Detendant provides no authority to conclude that this, standing alone, violates her\nconstitutional right to participate in her defense. And while the Court acknouledges the\nDefendant’s concerns regarding the conditions of her confinement, the Defendant has failed to\nprovide any basis to conclude that release is warranted on those grounds—even after the Court\nhas determined that she continues to pose a flight risk.*\n3 The Court will continue to ensure that the Defendant has the ability to speak and meet regularly\nwith her atorneys and to review all necessary discovery materials to prepare for her defense.\nDefense counsel shall confer with the Government on any specific requests.

Indeed, in recent weeks, the\nincidence of COVID-l9 among the inmate population where the Defendant is housed is truly\nalarming. See COVID-l9: Coronavirus, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, htps://www.bop.gov/\ncoronavirus/ (last visited Dec. 28, 2o2o) (noting that the MDC currently has 99 inmates and ll\nstaff members who have tested positive for COVID-l9). It could be argued that in the face of\nthis, only those defendants who pose a danger to the community ought to be detained pending\ntrial. If that were the law and in light of the increasing positivity rate, the Court would not\nhesitate to reopen the detention hearing and release the Defendant on bail since the Government\nrests none of its arguments on dangerousness. But that is not the law. Moreover, as the Court\nfound at the initial bail hearing, the Defendant has no underlying health conditions that put her at\nheightened risk of health impacts were she to contract COVID. The pandemic, including\nincreasing positivity numbers in the MDC, is not a basis for release in this case where the Court\nfinds that the Defendant poses a substantial and actual risk of flight and that no combination of\nconditions could reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nE. A hearing is unnecessary\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the parties’ arguments, the Court determines that a hearing is\nunnecessary and that it can resolve the motion on the papers. The briefing from both sides\ncomprehensively lays out the parties’ respective arguments For the reasons stated above, none\nof the new information has a material bearing on the Court’s determination that the Defendant\nposes a flight risk.

She is an American citizen, has lived in United States\nfor 3o years, has strong family ties and the support of friends and family residing in this country.\nShe wants nothing more than to remain in the United States under whatever conditions the Court\ndeems necessary so that she can effectively prepare for trial and vigorously defend against the\n25-year-old charges in the Indictment.

In light of the Court’s denial of that application (see Dkt. lo6), Ms.\nMaxwell nou proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the extraordinarily\nrestrictive bail package she has already offered.\n\ne First, Ms. Maxwell will renounce her French and British citizenship to eliminate\nany opportunity for her to seek refuge in those countries, if the Court so requires.\n\ne Second, Ms. Maxwell will have her and her spouse’s assets—excluding funds\nearmarked for living expenses, for legal fees and other expenses necessary to\ndefend her against the criminal charges in this case and related civil lawsuits and\nfor taxes—placed in a new account that will be monitored by a retired federal\nDistrict Court judge and former United States Atorney who will function as asset\nmonitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.\n\nThe former <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> goes well beyond the extradition waivers that the Court deemed\ninsufficient and should satisfy any concerns the Court may have that Ms. Maxwell may try to\nseek a safe haven in France or the United Kingdom.

This should\nsatisfy the Court’s concern that the proposed bond was not fully secured and left assets\nunrestrained that could be used for such purposes. (See id. at l7-l8).\n\nIn addition, since the last bail application, Ms. Maxwell has submited twelve pretrial\nmotions that raise substantial legal and factual issues that may result in the dismissal of some or\nall of the charges against her. Ms. Maxwell referenced some of these motions in her initial bail\napplication (see Dkt. l8 at l9) but was not in a position to fully articulate them until she had the\nchance to review the discovery and research the legal issues in advance of the motion deadline of\nJanuary 25. These motions significantly call into question the strength of the government’s case\nagainst Ms. Maxwell and the underlying justification for continued detention.\n\nMs. Maxwell has already been denied a fair chance in the court of public opinion. She\nhas been maligned by the media, which has perpetuated a false narrative about her that has\npoisoned any open-mindedness and impartiality of a potential jury. She has been relentlessly\natacked with vicious slurs, persistent lies, and blatant inaccuracies by spokespeople who have\nneither met nor spoken to her. She has been depicted as a cartoon-character villain in an atempt\nto turn her into a substitute replacement for Jeffrey Epstein. Yet, Ms. Maxwell is determined —\nand welcomes the opportunity — to face her accusers at trial and clear her name. The additional\nproposed bail conditions should quell any concerns that she would try to flee. The Court should\ntherefore grant bail under the proposed conditions so that Ms. Maxwell can adequately prepare\nfor trial.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool235\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001236.jpg": "Cased 2o-€rOo33ouAUNt DibCuMentl l6o2 lFik6G 82728 /2 49 Pagel 4 Ob 9\nl. The Proposed Additional Bail Conditions Will Reasonably Assure Ms. Maxwell’s\n\nAppearance in Court\n\nAs set forth above, Ms. Maxwell nou proposes two additional restrictions that eliminate\nany means or opportunity that she may have to leave the country. The Court should therefore\nreconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the proposed conditions. See United States v.\nRoue, No. o2 CR. 756 LMM, 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y.

Should\nthe Court feel this drastic <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> is necessary, the required documents will be submited to the\nappropriate authorities. Moreover, as a standard <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> of bail, all of Ms. Maxwell’s\npassports will be surrendered to the government and no further application will be made.\n\nIf the Court deems it a necessary <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> of release, Ms. Maxwell will formally\ncommence the procedure to renounce her foreign citizenship. The requisite paperwork is in the\nprocess of being completed. Renunciation of UK citizenship can be accomplished immediately\nupon granting of bail. The process of renouncing her French citizenship, while not immediate,\nmay be expedited.\n\nCitizenship is a precious and priceless asset. Ms. Maxwell’s decision to give up\ncitizenship from the county of her birth and the country of her upbringing demonstrates her\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool236\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001237.jpg": "Cased 2o-€rOo33ouAUNt DibCuMentl l6o2 lF iG 82228 /2 49 Pagel 5 Ob 9\nearnestness to abide by the conditions of her release and underscores that she has no intention to\nflee and reflects her deep need to communicate freely with counsel to prepare for her defense.\nHer renunciation of foreign citizenship obviates the Court’s concerns about the validity of\nwaivers of extradition. (See Dkt. lo6 at l3). Ms. Maxwell will have no ability to contest\nextradition from France or the United Kingdom on the basis of citizenship, which removes any\nincentive the Court and government believe she may have to seek refuge in those countries.\n\nB. Restraint and Monitoring of Assets\n\nIn denying bail, the Court noted that the bond was not fully secured, and that Ms.\nMaxwell and her spouse would still have several million dollars in unrestrained assets that could\nbe used to facilitate her flight from the country. (See id. at l7-l8). To assuage any concerns that\nthose assets would be available to finance flight to and shelter in a foreign country, Ms. Maxwell\nhas taken steps to create a monitorship that will place meaningful restraints on the assets that are\nnot used to secure the bond, while still allouing Ms. Maxwell to pay for her legal defense, for\nher spouse to pay for daily living expenditures and for payment of taxes.\n\nl. New Account\n\nAll assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse, with the exception of money currently held in\nescrou for legal fees and related defense expenses and the funds contained in the bank account in\nthe name of Ms. Maxwell’s spouse (“the Personal Account”)!, will be deposited in a newly\ncreated account (“the New Account”) to be overseen by an asset monitor appointed pursuant to\norder of the Court. The New Account will contain all of Ms. Maxwell’s and her spouse’s\nremaining cash and other liquid assets, including any proceeds that result from the pending sale\nl The Personal Account is identified as Account I on page 9 of the Financial Report annexed to Ms. Maxwell’s\nRenewed Bail Application.

No illiquid assets may\nbe sold, conveyed or transferred without approval of the asset monitor.\n\nDe Other Assets\n\nThe only funds that will not be included in the New Account are (l) the money currently\nheld in escrou by Ms. Maxwell’s atorneys, which will be used exclusively for her defense; and\n(2) the roughly $45o,ooo in the Personal Account which her spouse will use only for living\nexpenses. The asset monitor shall regularly receive information regarding activity of the Personal\nAccount, including the account balance, on a weekly basis. The asset monitor must also receive\nfive-day advance notice of any check, on-line payment, or transfer of funds in any amount\nexceeding $5,ooo, and the reason for such payment. Ms. Maxwell’s spouse agrees to be bound\nby these restrictions and reporting requirements.\n\nThe asset monitor shall report to Pretrial Services any possible non-compliance or\ndisbursement in violation of the terms and conditions specified above.\n\n3. Selected Asset Monitor\n\nThe Honorable William S. Duffey, Jr., a retired federal District Court judge and the\nformer United States Atorney for the Northern District of Georgia, has agreed to undertake the\nposition of asset monitor.

Ms. Maxwell’s Pretrial Motions Raise Substantial Legal and Factual Issues\n\nThat Could Result in Dismissal of Some or All of the Charges Against Her\n\nIn addition to the new conditions proposed above, the numerous substantive pretrial\nmotions nou before the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.\nMs. Maxwell’s pretrial motions raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of\ncharges, if not the entire indictment. Among the dozen submissions are motions to dismiss the\nsuperseding indictment for breach of the non-prosecution agreement, for pre-indictment delay,\nand for being based on improperly obtained evidence in violation of Ms. Maxwell’s\nconstitutional rights under the Fifth and Sixth the Amendments. Other motions seek dismissal of\nthe Mann Act charges as being time-barred and the perjury charges as based on non-perjurious\nstatements. These motions are substantial with a likelihood of success on the merits. These\nmotions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength of the government’s case and warrant\ngranting bail on the conditions proposed.\nIi. The Court Should Grant Bail\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act of l984, a defendant must be released on personal\nrecognizance or unsecured personal bond unless the judicial officer determines “that such release\nwill not reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required or will endanger the safety of\nany other person or the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(b). The enhanced bail package proposed\nby Ms. Maxwell contains financial burdens and a combination of restrictions that reasonably\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool239\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001240.jpg": "Cased 2o-€rOo33ouAUNt DibCute/ntl l6o2 lF ited 82728 /2 49 Pagel d Ob 9\nassure her appearance as required. Before preventive detention may be ordered under § 3l42(e),\nthe Court is obliged to determine both whether the defendant is likely to flee the jurisdiction if\nreleased, and whether any conditions of release will be reasonably certain to guard against this\npropensity to flee. The Court expressed concerns and denied bail without indicating what\nconditions would be reasonably certain to assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance. Ms. Maxwell is no\ndanger to the community and not alleged to have been involved in ongoing criminal activity. To\nsay that there are absolutely no conditions flies in the face of cases where non-United States\ncitizens with no ties to the district, let alone the country, were released on lesser conditions for\nalleged criminality ongoing up to or within hours of the time of arrest, in contrast to 26-year-old\nclaims alleged against Ms. Maxwell.”\n\nThe additional conditions set forth above, which supplement the exceptional bail package\npreviously proposed, are sufficient to address the hypothetical risk of flight and secure Ms.\nMaxwell’s presence at trial. The financial magnitude of the proposed bonds, the collateral\npledged to secure the bonds, the stringent requirements of home detention, the renunciation of\nforeign citizenship and monitoring of assets contained in a special account from which no funds\ncan be withdrawn without the approval and signature of a retired federal District Court judge and\nformer United States Atorney are conditions that amply satisfy the concerns expressed by the\ngovernment and the Court. These cnditions are unique and unprecedented. They profoundly\n* See Dkt. 97 at 34 (case-comparison chart in the Renewed Motion for Bail); cf People v. Dominique Strauss-Kahn,\no2526/2oll(S.Ct. N.Y.

Nathan\n\nUnited States District Court\n\nSouthern District of New York\n\nUnited States Courthouse\n\n4o Foley Square\n\nNew York, New York looo7\n\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in opposition to the defendant’s third\nmotion for release on bail, dated February 23, 2o2l (the “Third Bail Motion” or the “Motion’”).\n(Dkt. No. l6o). On July l4, 2o2o, after extensive briefing and a lengthy hearing, this Court\nconcluded that the defendant posed a serious flight risk and that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance in court. On December 28, 2o2o, after the defendant\nrenewed her motion for release on bail (the “Second Bail Motion”) by essentially restating her\nprior arguments and presenting a more significant and specific bail package, this Court issued a\nthorough opinion and again concluded that the defendant “plainly poses a risk of flight” and denied\nthe motion for “substantially the same reasons that the Court denied” her first motion for release.\n(Dkt. No. lo6 at l-2 (“Dec. Op.”)). The defendant appealed this Court’s December 2o2o decision\nto the Second Circuit, and that appeal remains pending. Nou, the defendant asks the Court yet\nagain to reconsider its decision, and proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the bail\npackage the Court previously considered and rejected. For the reasons set forth belou, the Motion\nshould be denied. First, the Court does not have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion—in\nwhich she asks this Court to reconsider its December opinion—because the defendant has appealed\nthat December opinion to the Second Circuit. Second, even assuming the Court had jurisdiction\nto grant this latest bail application, the Court should adhere to its prior rulings because the\ndefendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and the additional bail conditions proposed\nby the defendant do not justify reversal of the Court’s prior findings that no combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion should be denied.\n\nI. Background\n\nThe Government’s December l6, 2o2o opposition to the defendant’s Second Bail Motion\ndetails the background of the initial bail proceedings in this case and is incorporated by reference\nherein. (See Dkt. No. loo at 2-6). After this Court denied the defendant’s initial application for\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool243\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001244.jpg": "Caseel24o/fOoo88oHAEN Add uUMeht /LOF l FileadsasO9F2Ag ePage?lGhe\nPage 2\n\nbail in July 2o2o, the defendant filed a renewed motion for release in December 2o2o in which the\ndefendant proposed a “substantially larger bail package” and presented arguments that “either were\nmade at the initial bail hearing or could have been made then.” (Dec. Op. at l). In denying that\nsecond application, the Court found that the information provided in the Second Bail Motion “only\nsolidifies the Court’s view that the Defendant plainly poses a risk of flight and that no combination\nof conditions can ensure her appearance.” (/d. at l-2).\n\nOn January ll, 2o2l, the defendant filed a notice of appeal to the Second Circuit appealing\nthe Court’s December 2o2o opinion denying the Second Bail Motion. (Dkt. No. ll3). That appeal\nis pending; the defendant has not yet filed her brief in support of the appeal.\n\nOn February 23, 2o2l, the defendant submited the Third Bail Motion, in which she\nproposed two additional bail conditions to “supplement the . . . bail package she has already\noffered” in the Second Bail Motion (Mot. at 2): (l) renunciation of the defendant’s French and\nBritish citizenship; and (2) placement of a portion of her and her spouse’s assets in a new account\nto be overseen by an asset monitor.\n\nIl. The Court Does Not Have Jurisdiction to Grant the Third Bail Motion Because of\nthe Defendant’s Pending Bail Appeal\n\nThe defendant asks this Court to “reconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the\nproposed conditions.” (Mot. at 4). More specifically, the defendant asks the Court to consider the\nexact same package previously considered and rejected in the December opinion, as nou\n“supplement[ed]” by two additional conditions. (/d. at 2,8). Houever, the Court lacks jurisdiction\nto grant the Motion by virtue of the defendant’s appeal of the Court’s prior ruling to the Second\nCircuit.\n\n“As a general mater, ‘the filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional\nsignificance—it confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its\ncontrol over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.’” United States v. Rodgers, lol F.3d\n247, 25l (2d Cir. l996) (quoting Griggs v. Provident Consumer Disc. Co., 459 U.S. 56, 58 (l982)).\n“The divestiture of jurisdiction rule . . . is a judicially crafted rule rooted in the interest of judicial\neconomy, designed ‘to avoid confusion or waste of time resulting from having the same issues\nbefore two courts at the same time.’” Rodgers, lol F.3d at 25l (quoting United States v. Salerno,\n868 F.2d 524, 54o (2d Cir. l989)); see also United States v. Ransom, 866 F.2d 574, 576 (2d Cir.\nl989) (describing the Griggs rule as “promot[ing] the orderly conduct of business in both the trial\nand appellate courts”).\n\nIn January 2o2l, the defendant filed an appeal from the Court’s December 28, 2o2o\nOpinion and Order denying her Second Bail Motion. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion not only\nseeks reconsideration of the very issue presently on appeal but does so by proposing two additional\nbail conditions to “supplement” the bail package proposed in the defendant’s Second Bail Motion,\n(Mot. at 2, 8), a package which this Court considered and concluded could not “reasonably assure\nher appearance.” (Dec. Op. at l6). Accordingly, the defendant’s Third Bail Motion also concerns\nbail and is thus an “aspect[] of the case involved in the appeal.” Rodgers, lol F.3d at 25l. The\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool244\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001246.jpg": "Caseel24o/fOooB8BoHAEN Add uMent /LOF l Fiedsas/O9F2Ag ePage@ 4 l69\nPage 4\n\nare serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the\nGovernment, including multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, is strong; the\nDefendant has substantial resources and foreign ties (including citizenship in a country that does\nnot extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who lived in hiding and apart from the family to\nwhom she nou asserts important ties, has not been fully candid about her financial situation.”\n(Dec. Op. at 2). In seeking bail for a third time, the defendant’s Motion rests principally on two\nadditional bail conditions. Neither of these conditions will reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, and neither outweighs all of the other factors that make this defendant an\nextreme flight risk. Moreover, the Court should reject as premature the defendant’s assertion that\nher pretrial motions have somehou weakened the Government’s case; those motions have not been\nadjudicated, and, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s opposition memorandum, the\ndefendant’s motions have no merit.\n\nIn short, all three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncontinue to weigh heavily in favor of detention, and the defendant’s Motion does not present any\ninformation that warrants revisiting this Court’s well-reasoned and detailed prior decisions.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n“After a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can reasonably\nassure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail hearing if\n‘information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a\nmaterial bearing on the issue’ of whether pretrial detention is warranted.” (Dec. Op. at 4 (quoting\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)). “A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent authority,\neven where the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text.” (Ud. at 5). Although courts\nin this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence\nproffered on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing,” United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3),\ngenerally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant reconsideration” by, for\nexample, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or incorrectly applied the law,” or\nthat failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.” United States v. Petrov, No. l5\nCr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s Motion rests on three arguments, none of which is availing. First, the\ndefendant offers to renounce her foreign citizenship, claiming that this eliminates the risk that she\nwill flee from prosecution. Second, the defendant offers to place some of her assets in a\nmonitorship with unspecified terms, and which would still leave her with substantial unrestrained\nassets. Third, the defendant claims that her voluminous pretrial motions have diminished the\nstrength of the Government’s case. None of these arguments is persuasive, and the Motion should\nbe denied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool246\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001248.jpg": "Caseel24o/fRooBBoHAEN Add uMeht /LOF l FiedsasO9F2Ag ePageb lGho\nPage 6\nher intent not to flee. (Dec. Op. at l3 n.2). The Court recognized that “a defendant could\nstrategically offer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent\nextradition that might result.” (/d.). So too here. An offer to renounce her foreign citizenship\n“Ts|hould the Court feel this drastic <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> is necessary,” (Mot. at 4) is another strategic, but\nhollou offer given that the defendant would be free to fight extradition once in the United Kingdom\nor France, or any other jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chooses to flee).\n\nAs such, the defendant’s claimed “willing[ness]” to renounce her citizenship in both the\nUnited Kingdom and France is litle more than windou dressing. After receiving the defendant’s\nThird Bail Motion, the Government, through the Department of Justice’s Office of International\nAffairs (“OIA”), contacted the French Ministry of Justice (“MOJ”) to understand the impact of the\ndefendant’s offer to renounce her French citizenship on France’s categorical unwillingness to\ndeport its oun citizens for crimes they have commited. In response, the MOJ provided the\nGovernment with a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively indicating that the\ndefendant’s offer to waive her French citizenship will not make her eligible to be extradited from\nFrance because, for purposes of extradition, nationality is assessed as of the time the charged\noffense was commited. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation of the\nleter, are atached hereto as Exhibit A. See Ex. A (“[A]ny loss of nationality subsequent to said\noffense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of\nnationality.”); see also Dkt. No. loo, Ex. B at 3 (MOJ leter stating that the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the extradition of a person who had French nationality\nat the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested”). The defendant’s\nrenunciation of her French citizenship in 2o2l would not change the fact that she was a French\ncitizen at the time she is alleged to have commited the charged crimes in the l99os and 2ol6. As\nsuch, the defendant’s citizenship at the time of the alleged crimes would bar her extradition from\nFrance, making her offer to renounce her French citizenship meaningless.\n\nMeanwhile, the defendant’s offer to give up her British citizenship does not mean that she\nwill not fight extradition once in the United Kingdom or that an extradition request to the United\nKingdom would be successful. The Government understands from OJA that a defendant’s\nnationality has historically played litle to no role in extradition from the United Kingdom. Indeed,\nArticle 3 of the 2oo3 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom\nexpressly prohibits using nationality as a basis to deny _ extradition. See\nhtps://www.congress.gov/lo8/cdoc/tdoc23/CDOC-lo8tdoc23.pdf at 5 (“Extradition shall not be\nrefused based on the nationality of the person sought.”); see also Croun Prosecution Service,\nExtradition, Legal Guidance, International and organised crime (May l2, 2o2o),\nhtps://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/extradition (seting forth the statutory bars to extradition,\nwhich do not include nationality). In any event, assuming the Government could locate and\napprehend the defendant if she were to flee, as set forth in the Government’s opposition to the\nSecond Bail Motion, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on\nextradition based on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the\npassage of time, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>. The\nGovernment understands from OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently\nextensively litigated, uncertain, and subject to multiple levels of appeal. This process is lengthy,\ncomplicated, and time-consuming, and would provide no measure of justice to the victims who\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool248\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001249.jpg": "Caseel24 o/7o oB8BoHAEN Add uMent /LOF l Fieadsas/O9F2Ag ePag ef lG\nPage 7\nwould be forced to wait years for the defendant’s return.\n\nAs the Government has repeatedly emphasized, the strong possibility that the defendant\ncould successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee. (Dkt. No.\nloo at l9-2o). Indeed, in rejecting the defendant’s offer in the Second Bail Motion to execute\nanticipatory extradition waivers, the Court noted, among other things, “the likelihood that any\nextradition would be a difficult and lengthy process.” (Dec. Op. at l3). The Court further noted\nthat the “likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any extradition requests—even\nif she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition entirely—weighs strongly in favor\nof detention.” (/d.). That statement remains true even if the face of the defendant’s newest offer\nto renounce her foreign citizenship.\n\nAs this Court previously found, the defendant has substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, and ouns at least one foreign property of significant value. (Dec.\nOp. at lo-ll). The defendant’s alleged willingness to renounce her foreign citizenship should not\nfundamentally alter the Court’s conclusions.\n\n2. The Court Should Reject the Defendant’s Proposed Monitorship <span class=\"highlight\">Condition</span>\n\nNext, the defendant has offered to place a portion of her and her spouse’s assets into a new\naccount that “will be monitored by a retired federal District Court judge and former United States\nAtorney who will function as asset monitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.”\n(Mot. at 2). This proposed <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>—the details of which are vague—is insufficient to ensure\nthat the defendant appears in Court.\n\nIt first bears noting that the defendant’s finances—and her candor with the Court about\nthose finances— is not an issue of first impression. Significantly absent from the defendant’s\nMotion is any atempt to address the Court’s determination that the defendant’s “lack of candor\nraises significant concerns as to whether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate\npicture of her finances and as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of\nrelease.” (Dec. Op. at l6). That is critical because the value of any proposed monitorship would\ndepend entirely on the monitor having a completely accurate picture of the defendant’s finances\nand access to all of her accounts and sources of wealth. Given the Court’s concerns about the\ndefendant’s candor, the Court should hesitate before trusting the defendant to be transparent with\na monitor under her employ.\n\nIn any event, even if the Court were to accept the defendant’s representations about her\nassets at face value, the defendant’s proposal would leave the defendant with significant assets\nunrestrained. In particular, the defendant’s proposal does not in any way restrain her $2 million\ntounhouse in London, which she could live in or sell to support herself. Although the defendant\nasserts that the monitor would oversee any account into which the proceeds of the sale of the\ndefendant’s properties were deposited, the defendant does not explain hou the monitor—or this\nCourt—would have the authority to force the defendant to deposit foreign assets in a domestic\naccount. As the Government has previously explained, the Government cannot realistically\nrecover assets abroad. Accordingly, the defendant’s proposal would leave her with access to at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool249\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001250.jpg": "Caseel24o/cOooB8BoHAEN Add uMent /LOF l Fiedsas/O9F2Ag ePageBlGh9\nPage 8\nleast $2 million. In addition, the defendant proposes that she retain an additional half a million\ndollars in liquid assets in an unrestrained account, as well as any future income.” That figure\nappears to be in addition to the approximately $l million in “chatels” the defendant has disclosed\namong her various assets. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. In short, the defendant’s proposal would leave\nher with ample resources to fund her flight from prosecution.\n\nFurther still, the defendant’s Motion provides only cursory details of the monitorship\nprogram she proposes, and it offers no legal precedent to explain what, if any, authority this Court\nhas to establish and oversee such a monitorship. Aside from defense counsel’s assertions, the\nMotion offers nothing that would enable the Court to meaningfully consider the details of such a\nmonitorship. Among other things, it is unclear from the defendant’s Motion whether such a\nprogram would require the defendant’s voluntary compliance with the monitorship, or whether the\nfunds would be placed in a bank account that the defendant could not access. Given that the\ndefendant’s Motion suggests that atorney’s fees could be disbursed without approval, it appears\nthat the defendant’s proposal would provide her latitude to engage in financial transactions, subject\nonly to a review that would require her voluntary compliance.\n\nFinally, although the defendant does not provide any detail about the amount of money she\nwould pay the monitor, presumably the monitor would not undertake this responsibility for free.\nAs a result, the tension between the monitor’s obligation to review the defendant’s finances and\nthe monitor’s employment relationship with the defendant creates a conflict of interest. But at\nbotom, if the Court determines that the only way to keep the defendant from using her assets to\nflee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too great a flight risk to release.\n\nIn sum, in light of this Court’s determination that the defendant “has not been fully candid\nabout her financial situation,” the Court should reject the defendant’s vague proposal. (Dec. Op.\nat 2). Nothing in the defendant’s Motion should alter the Court’s determination that the defendant\nposes a significant risk of flight, and that she has the resources and skills to flee prosecution. The\nCourt should reject the proposed bail conditions.\n\n3. The Defendant’s Pending Pretrial Motions Have Not Diminished the Strength\nof the Government’s Case\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that the “numerous substantive pretrial motions nou\nbefore the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.” (Mot. at 7).\nBut the defendant cannot merely point to the sheer volume of briefing she has filed to suggest that\nthe strength of the Government’s case has diminished. To the contrary, as the Government has set\nforth in detail in its memorandum in opposition, the defendant’s pretrial motions are entirely\nwithout merit. In any event, it is premature for the defendant to claim that her pretrial motions—\nwhich have not been adjudicated, much less granted—have altered the Court’s original\n> The defendant’s proposal also leaves unrestrained several million dollars in escrou for the\ndefendant’s legal fees. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9 (listing approximately $7.6 million in retainer fees);\nsee also Mot. at 6. If the defendant fled the country, her counsel would presumably be required to\nreturn those funds to the defendant, who would no longer need defense counsel in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool25o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001251.jpg": "Caseel22 o/o o8BoHAEN 2ADetuMhent ‘LOZ l Filecgsas/O9F2ig eP aged l6h\nPage 9\ndetermination that the Government’s case is strong.\nIV.

Were it so, a\ndistrict court would have no authority to remand or modify bail conditions of a defendant\nreleased while the government appeals the grant of bail. Such a rule would detract from, rather\nthan promote, judicial economy and would be unworkable in practice.\n\nShould the Court believe it does not have jurisdiction to decide the present bail\nmotion, Ms. Maxwell will move the Circuit to withdraw her notice of appeal without\nprejudice and thereby remove any theoretical bar to this Court’s jurisdiction over the\npresent bail motion.

The leter asserts that the loss of\nFrench nationality subsequent to the criminal act which the person is alleged to have commited\ndoes not affect the rule against the extradition of nationals, as nationality must be assessed at the\ntime of commission of the offense and not at the time of the extradition request. As discussed in\nthe opinion from William Julie, French legal counsel (atached as Exhibit A), the\ngovernment’s assertion is entirely incorrect for the follouing reasons:\n\n= The government’s argument goes against the leter of the law.\n= The government’s argument goes against the spirit of the law.\n= The government’s argument is contradicted by precedent and case law.\n(Julie Opinion {ff 6-26).\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool258\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001259.jpg": "Cased 2o-CrOd3souAdNit DibCutrent l7o2 lFiKOS3i2e8/2agPidge& 66l8\n\nThe language of the extradition treaty between the United States and France and the\napplicable French statues are clear that anyone seeking to contest extradition on the basis of\nFrench citizenship must be a French national at the time of the extradition request.

To the contrary, it was\ndesigned to apply to individuals who had acquired French citizenship subsequent to the\ncommission of the alleged crime “in order to avoid fraudulent nationality applications of\noffenders seeking to escape extradition.” (Ud. 4§ l5-l6). Ifthe person is no longer a French\nnational at the time of the request, the provision does not apply. The government cites no case\nwhere the relevant statute was applied to protect a formerly French national from extradition,\nand we have found none ourselves. (/d. {] l9-2l).

While we\nmaintain that Ms. Maxwell’s writen waivers of the right to challenge extradition should\nsuffice, her willingness to forfeit citizenship birthrights exceeds what is necessary and\nprofoundly demonstrates her commitment to abide by conditions of release and appear at\ntrial.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool259\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001260.jpg": "Cased 2o-CrQd3souAdNt Dibcutrentl l7o2 lFiKO S328 /2agPidges 66l8\nMonitoring of Assets is a Valid and Significant <span class=\"highlight\">Condition</span> of Release\n\nTo address the Court’s concern about Ms. Maxwell’s access to assets, the bail\nmotion proposed another extremely significant and restrictive bail <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> — the\nimposition of a monitor to supervise the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse and\napprove expenditures. Rather than suggest conditions to satisfy its concerns, the\ngovernment urges the Court to summarily reject the proposed monitorship.\n\nWilliam S.

Judge Duffey has extensive experience evaluating and monitoring\nfunds held in and disbursed from financial accounts.

As required by court order, documentation concerning the\nproceeds of the sale will be provided to Judge Duffey and the funds will be deposited in the\nfinancial account approved by Judge Duffey.\n\nThe government tries to steer the Court’s atention to allegations of Ms. Maxwell’s lack\nof candor to dissuade the Court from considering the proposed monitorship as a meaningful\nrestraint on the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse.

Further, no valid\nchallenge has been made to those submissions.\n\nThe government challenges the Court by inanely stating that if “the only way to keep\nthe defendant from using her assets to flee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too\ngreat a risk to release.” (Dkt.l65 at 8.) This statement is fundamentally illogical as it\nundermines most conditions of release. For example, the same could be said of electronic\nmonitoring — l.e., if the only way to keep a defendant from fleeing the jurisdiction is to place\nhim on home confinement with electronic monitoring, then he is too great a flight risk to\nrelease.* The Court should readily dismiss this frivolous argument. Under the Bail Reform Act,\nif there are appropriate conditions for release, bail should be granted. The conditions\ncollectively proposed in the previous and present bail applications provide ample assurance that\nMs. Maxwell will be present at trial.\n\n3 Moreover, in an effort to further obfuscate the merits of Ms. Maxwell’s bail application, the government\ndesperately argues that funds for legal services, presently held in atorney escrou accounts, would be\nreleased and made available to support Ms. Maxwell as a fugitive. To suggest that defense counsel would\nbecome accomplices to a violation of a court order shous uter disrespect for Ms. Maxwell’s defense team.\nIn particular, New York counsel, who have spent the entirety of their legal careers practicing in this district\nand establishing well-respected reputations among the bench and bar, take umbrage at the government’s\ncallous assertion.\n\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool26l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001264.jpg": "CaSesb:2o-cr/ooBBQHANAt DOctMe rt l/2o 2 Filedeas/2o/PagPage aol66l8\nReform Act, Ms. Maxwell must be released unless there are \"no conditions\" that would\nreasonably assure her presence.

Background\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The\nDefendant has been incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center since that time.\n\nThe Defendant renewed her motion for release on bail on December 8, 2o2o. The Court\nagain denied the Defendant’s motion. In doing so, the Court explained that none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments materially impacted its conclusion that the Defendant posed a risk of\nflight. It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry\nlengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the Government,\nincluding multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant’s\nsubstantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool275\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001276.jpg": "Cased 2o-€rOd33ouAdNnt Tibsutrent l682 lF iO 83222/2agFlagec8 o642\nescape; and that the Defendant’s lack of candor regarding her family ties and financial situations\nraised serious doubts as to her willingness to comply with any conditions imposed by the Court.\nSee Dkt. No. lo6.\n\nOn February 23, 2o2l, the Defendant filed a third motion for release on bail. Dkt. No.\nl6o (“Def. Mot.”). The Government opposed the Defendant’s motion on March 9, 2o2l. Dkt.\nNo. l65 (“Gov’t Opp’n’”). The Defendant filed her reply under temporary seal on March l6,\n2o2l.\n\nI. Legal Standard\n\nThe parties dispute whether the divestiture of jurisdiction rule precludes this Court from\ngranting the Defendant’s third bail motion while Defendant’s bail appeal is pending. See Gov’t\nOpp’n at 2-3; Reply at 2-3; see also United States v. Rodgers, lol F.3d 247, 25l (2d Cir. l996)\n(“As a general mater, ‘the filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional significance—\nit confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its control over\nthose aspects of the case involved in the appeal.’”) (citation omited). Under Rule 37(a) of the\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure, houever, the Court unquestionably has authority to defer\nconsidering the motion, deny the motion, or state either that it would grant the motion if the court\nof appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a substantial issue. Fed. R. Crim. P.\n37(a). Because the Court denies the Defendant’s motion, it does not resolve the question of\nwhether it would have jurisdiction to grant it.\n\nPretrial detainees have a right to bail under the Eighth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution and under the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l4l, et seg. The Bail Reform Act\nrequires that a court release a defendant “subject to the least restrictive further <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>, or\ncombination of conditions, that [it] determines will reasonably assure the appearance of the\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool276\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001277.jpg": "Cased 2o-€rOd33ouAUNnt Tibsutent l682 lF iO 837222/24gPFlaGeot o642\nperson as required and the safety of any other person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(c)(l)(B). The Court may order that the defendant be held without bail only if, after\nconsidering the factors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>\nor combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and\nthe safety of any other person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nAfter a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can\nreasonably assure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Bail Reform Act allous the\nCourt to reopen the bail hearing if “information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the\ntime of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue” of whether pretrial detention is\nwarranted. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f). The Court is not required to do so if it determines that any new\ninformation would not have a material bearing on the issue. See United States v. Raniere, No.\nl8-CR-2o4l (NGG) (VMS), 2ol8 WL 63442o2, at *2 n.7 (E.D.N.Y.

Supp. 2d 335, 339 (W.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (electing not to reopen a detention hearing\nbecause the new information would not have changed the court’s decision to detain the defendant\nuntil trial). In addition, the Court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent\nauthority, even when the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text. See, e.g., United\nStates v.

Discussion\nThe Defendant bases her third motion for bail on the Court’s inherent pouers to review\nits oun bail decisions, arguing that the new conditions she proposes warrant reconsideration of\nthe Court’s earlier rulings. See Def. Mot. at 4. She also argues that the strength of the\nGovernment’s case is diminished in light of the arguments she advances in her pre-trial motions,\nwhich are currently pending before the Court. /d. at 7.

The Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the Defendant presents a risk of flight and that there are no\nset of conditions, including the Defendant’s third set of proposed conditions, that are sufficient to\nreasonably assure her appearance. The presumption in favor of detention, the weight of the\nevidence, and the history and characteristics of the Defendant all continue to support that\nconclusion. The Defendant’s proposed conditions do not alter the Court’s determination.\n\nA. The Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors has not changed\n\nTo begin with, the presumption in favor of detention continues to apply with equal force.\nSee Dkt. No. lo6 (“Dec. Op.”) at 7-8. And though the Court again concludes that the Defendant\nhas met her burden of production, the presumption “remains a factor to be considered among\nthose weighed by the district court.” Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436 (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at\nll44). The Court is mindful “that Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of\nflight, and that ‘a strong probability arises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate\nto secure their appearance.” Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nThe Court’s analysis of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors also remains unchanged.\n\nBecause the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged include crimes involving a minor\nvictim, the first l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factor continues to weigh strongly in favor of detention.\nAnd the Court remains of the opinion that the Defendant does not pose a danger to any person or\nto the community. The fourth § 3l42(g) factor thus weighs against detention.\n\nWith respect to the second § 3l42(g) factor, none of the Defendant’s new arguments alter\nthe Court’s conclusion as to the weight of the evidence. The Defendant argues that the pre-trial\nmotions “raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of charges, if not the entire\nindictment,” and she contends that “[t]hese motions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooool279\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001280.jpg": "Cased 2o-€rOd33ouAUNnt Tibsutrent l682 lFiKOS3222/2agAaGeor o642\nof the government’s case and warrant granting bail on the conditions proposed.” Def. Mot. at 7.\nThose motions became fully briefed one week ago and are nou pending before this Court. The\nGovernment strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated\nthem. Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the\npresumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the proffered strength\nand nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention. See Dec.\nOp. at 9-lo.\n\nThe Court’s assessment of the Defendant’s history and characteristics has not changed.\nSee Dec. Op. at lo-l6. The Defendant continues to have substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\ndetection. /d. at lo-ll. And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor\nregarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor. See Dec. Op.\nat l6. There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\nconditions of release. Jd. While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors. While the fourth factor continues to\nfavor release, the first three factors and the presumption of detention all support the conclusion\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool28o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001281.jpg": "Cased 2o-€rOd33ouAUNnt Tibsutent l682 lF ib 837222/2agFidgec’ o642\nthat the Defendant poses a significant risk of flight. Thus, the Court again concludes that there\nare no conditions of release that will reasonably assure her appearance in future proceedings.\n\nB. Pretrial detention continues to be warranted\n\nThe thrust of the Defendant’s argument in her third motion for bail is that the two new\nproposed conditions vitiate the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight. The Defendant first\noffers to renounce her French and British citizenship. Def. Mot. at 2. And she also proposes to\nhave most of her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be monitored by a\nretired federal judge, who would function as an asset monitor and will have co-signing authority\nover the account. /d. Those conditions are offered in addition to the bail package she proposed\nin December. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7; see also Def. Mot. at 2. The new bail package does not\ndisturb the Court’s conclusion that the Government has carried its burden of shouing that these\nconditions are insufficient to mitigate the flight risks, and the Court again determines that no set\nof conditions—including the two new ones—can reasonably assure her future appearance.\n\nThe Court begins with the Defendant’s offer to renounce her French and United Kingdom\ncitizenship. She notes that she can renounce her UK citizenship “immediately upon granting of\nbail,” and she informs the Court that “[t]he process of renouncing her French citizenship, while\nnot immediate, may be expedited.” Def. Mot. at 4. As the Government notes, the offer is of\nunclear validity, and the relevance and practical impact of the renunciations is, at best, unclear.\nSee Gov’t Opp’n at 5. With respect to her offer to renounce her French citizenship, the Court is\nagain confronted with dueling opinions on the correct interpretation of French law. The\nGovernment relies on the position of the head of the International Criminal Assistance Bureau of\nthe French Ministry of Justice, who argues that “the fact that the wanted individual is a French\nnational constitutes an insuperable obstacle to his/her removal,” and that “[a]s long as said\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooool28l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001283.jpg": "Casest: 2o-cr/ooB8G ANA B6cuMe?t VEO 2 Filedsas/22/PagPage 4ol65l2\nparallel those that the Court articulated when the Defendant proposed signing an extradition\nwaiver. See Dec. Op. at l2-l3.\n\nSimilar doubts exist as to the Defendant’s offer to renounce her UK citizenship. The\nCourt is persuaded by the Government’s arguments that even if the Defendant were to renounce\nher UK citizenship, she would still likely be able to delay or resist extradition from the UK. See\nGov’t Opp’n at 6-7. And for largely similar reasons, the Court again concludes that the\nproposed conditions do not meaningfully diminish the Court’s concerns regarding the\nDefendant’s ability to flee and to frustrate or impair any subsequent extradition atempts. The\npossibility that the Defendant could successfully resist or forestall extradition heightens the\nDefendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nTo summarize, the Defendant’s willingness to renounce her French and UK citizenship\ndoes not sufficiently assuage the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight that the Defendant\nposes. Considerable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the\nrenunciations cloud whatever relevance they might otherwise have to the Court’s assessment of\nwhether the Defendant poses a risk of flight. See United States v. Cohen, No. C lo-oo547 (SD,\n2olo WL 5387757, at *9 n.ll (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2o, 2olo). And that same uncertainty—and the\npossibility that she will be able to successfully resist, or at least delay, extradition—incentivizes\nflight, particularly because of the Defendant’s substantial international ties.\n\nNor does the second proposed <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> materially alter the Court’s determination that no\n<span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions can reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The\nDefendant proposes to have a retired federal judge provide oversight authority over her financial\naffairs, and, if granted, he would have the authority to restrain, monitor, and approve\ndisbursement of assets requiring his signature. See Reply at 5. The Court continues to have\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool283\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001284.jpg": "Casest: 2o-cr/ooB8G AUN D6cuMen?t VEO 2 Filedsas/22/PagPage 4ll6l5l2\nconcerns about whether the full extent of the Defendant’s assets have been disclosed in light of\nthe lack of transparency when she was first arrested. But the Court assumes, for purposes of\nresolving this motion, that the financial report that it reviewed in December is accurate and that it\naccounts for all of the Defendant’s and her spouse’s assets. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7.\n\nThe monitorship <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> does not reasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance,\neven when viewed in combination with the rest of the Defendant’s bail package. The Defendant\nwould continue to have access to substantial assets—certainly enough to enable her flight and to\nevade prosecution. These include the $45o,ooo that the Defendant would retain for living\nexpenses and any future salaries for her or her spouse, along with other assets, including jewelry\nand other chatels, that are potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. See Def. Mot. at\n5-6; see also Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. While those amounts may be a small percentage of the\nDefendant’s total assets, they represent a still-substantial amount that could easily facilitate\nflight. When combined with the Court’s weighing of the § 3l42(g) factors and the presumption\nof detention, the Court concludes that the proposed restraints are insufficient to alter its\nconclusion that no combination of conditions can reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nIf the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could reasonably assure the\nDefendant’s future appearance, it would order her release. Yet while her proposed bail package\nis substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable assurances. As a result, the Court again\ndetermines that “no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the\nappearance of” the Defendant, and it denies her motion for bail on this basis. l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(l).\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooool284\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001286.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 2o-3, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Pagel45 of l65\nExhibit M\nDoe. l59\nGhislaine Maxwell’s Leter Regarding MDC Conditions\nDOJ-OGR-ooool286\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001287.jpg": "Caseel27 o/oo88 OHAEN AD uUMAEht /L52 l Filecsoad 6729 ePage tl l6ks3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Ghislaine Maxwell\n2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe government’s recent leter regarding MDC conditions (Dkt.l58) essentially repeats\nthe same points it made in defense of the MDC’s request that the Court vacate its order directing\nthe MDC to permit Ms. Maxwell to use a laptop on weekends and holidays. We appreciate the\nCourt’s concern regarding Ms. Maxwell’s opportunity to review discovery and the extent to\nwhich she is required to undergo searches. The government’s leter, houever, does not include\nthe concerns defense counsel has reported to MDC Legal during the past couple of months. In\naddition, the leter incorrectly states that legal calls are available on Saturdays. Such requests by\ncounsel have been denied.\n\nBy ignoring the myriad other issues reported by counsel, the government’s leter\nmisrepresents Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement. Ms. Maxwell does not have access to\ndaily discovery review for the entirety of the l3 hours. The vagaries and delays of moving her\nthe 5o feet or so from the isolation cell to the day room are a large part of the challenge.\n\nThe number of searches is also not correct. Ms. Maxwell is searched on every move,\nincluding to the empty concrete space, adjacent to the day room, used for recreation. Currently,\nshe is subject to a minimum of four pat doun searches a day if she goes to rec, and five pat doun\nsearches on the day of her weekly body scan. Since July 6\", Ms. Maxwell has been physically\nsearched approximately l4oo times, including pat doun searches, metal wand searches, mouth,\nhair and ear searches (posing additional health risks during COVID), and upwards of 6o body\nscans. In addition, there have been hundreds of physical searches of her isolation cell, locker,\nlegal papers, and personal effects. No contraband has ever been found.\n\nWe take issue with MDC’s assessment that “the searches are all necessary for the safety\nof the institution and the defendant.” Ms. Maxwell is under 24-hour surveillance by two to six\nguards and approximately l8 cameras, not including the hand-held camera, focused on her\nthroughout the areas in which she is moved and confined. Ms. Maxwell poses no danger to\nanyone. Her restrictive conditions, searches, and constant surveillance correlate directly to BOP\nnegligence resulting in the death of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool287\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001289.jpg": "Caseel22 o/o o8BOHAEN ADE uUMAEht /L52 l Filecsad 6729 ePageBlGks\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIA\\\n\nIt is impossible to overstate the deleterious effect of the conditions under which Ms.\nMaxwell is detained. Upon arrival at the MDC seven months ago, she was placed on suicide\nwatch though no competent medical professional deemed her in any manner suicidal, nor has any\npsychologist or medical staffer ever found her to be suicidal at any time during her detention.\n\nFor weeks she was deprived of legal material, the ability to use a telephone to make personal\ncalls, and the opportunity to exercise and shouer. Clearly, this was an effort to avoid a\nrecurrence of the BOP’s negligence regarding Jeffrey Epstein’s death. Contrary to the way she is\nhyper-monitored, Ms. Maxwell is classified with the standard CCl-Mh designation: inmate with\nno significant mental health care.\n\nThe overall conditions of detention have had a detrimental impact on Ms. Maxwell’s\nhealth and overall well-being; and she is withering to a shell of her former self — losing weight,\nlosing hair, and losing her ability to concentrate. In addition to the many difficulties impacting\nher review of electronic discovery materials, the over-management and stress are impacting her\nstamina and effectiveness in preparing her defense and conferring with counsel.\n\nHaving been incarcerated in de facto solitary confinement for 225 days and monitored by\ntwo to six guards 24 hours a day with a handheld camera dedicated to capturing her every move,\nexcept when it would record improper conduct on the part of the guards, it is not surprising that\nMs. Maxwell feels she is detained under the control of the Bureau of “Pretrial Punishment.”\n\nVery truly yours,\nBOBBI C.

During that time\nperiod, the Court set and then continued several trial dates due to the pandemic, including dates in\nDecember 2o2o and February 2o2l. See, e.g, Doc. 27l. Mr. Robertson’s trial will nou be reset\nfor April 5, 2o2l, and the Court is hopeful that he will finally get his day in court after the extreme\nand unprecedented delay he has endured. Complicating maters, houever, is the fact that the\npandemic and the resulting passage of time has led to a recent and significant change in Mr.\nRobertson’s defense team: both of his original atorneys withdrew from the case in January of this\nyear.

It explained\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool293\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001294.jpg": "Gaseel2l'7/oroo 2artauivient DodumMdil B62 Fileth662o6/PhgPage af 6656\n\nthat it was “very concerned” about the amount of time Mr. Robertson had been in custody up to\nthat point, especially given that the already-minimal rehabilitative and mental health services in\njail had been further reduced by the pandemic.

The Court also noted that\nwhile it was concerned about Mr. Robertson’s ability to meet with his atorneys to prepare for trial\nduring the pandemic, it had been informed that the defense team would be able to meet in\nconference rooms in the federal courthouse in Albuquerque. Jd. at 45.\n\nMr. Robertson nou asks the Court to reconsider its earlier decision denying him pretrial\nrelease. Doc. 274.

The government opposes the requested reconsideration. Doc. 282.\n\nDISCUSSION\nl. Reconsideration is Proper on the Basis of New Evidence Previously Unavailable.\n\nAs an initial mater, Mr. Robertson has raised legitimate reasons for the Court to reconsider\nits earlier release decision. As the Court has previously explained, it is well-established in this\nCircuit that although the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure do not expressly authorize a motion\nfor reconsideration, such motions are proper in criminal cases. See United States v. Christy, 739\nF.3d 534, 539 (loth Cir. 2ol4). A district court thus may amend its interlocutory orders prior to\nentry of final judgment. See, e.g., Van Skiver v. United States, 952 F.2d l24l, l243 (loth Cir.\n' All references to the transcript are to the draft copy.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool294\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001296.jpg": "CGaseel2l\\7/oroo 2artauivent Documdil B62 Fileeh662o6/PhgPage & 6656\nRobertson release in September of last year, it believed that he would only remain in pretrial\ndetention for three additional months until a December 7, 2o2o trial date. Doc. l94. As bad as\nthe pandemic had been to that point, the Court did not expect the federal judiciary to remain in a\nstate of near total suspension for another six months, requiring the trial to be continued twice more\nto the current April 5, 2o2l trial date. Second, when the Court denied Mr. Robertson release last\nSeptember, it was under the impression that he would be able to meet with his atorneys in person\nin conference rooms at the Albuquerque courthouse, mitigating the Court’s concerns about the\ndefense team’s ability to effectively prepare for trial. See supra at 4. The Court’s impression on\nthat point turned out to be incorrect: due to concerns about inmates meeting with atorneys and\nthen bringing COVID-l9 back into the jails, the idea of unrestricted atorney-client meetings at\nthe Albuquerque courthouse was ultimately rejected. Third, the Court is nou able to impose\nsignificantly stricter conditions of release because of its ability to release Mr. Robertson to La\nPasada Halfway House, an option with which it was not presented last September.\n\nI. Mr. Robertson’s Release to La Pasada Halfway House Under Extremely Strict\nand Carefully Tailored Conditions Will Reasonably Assure His Appearance and\nthe Safety of the Community Under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e).\n\nOn the merits, the Court has thoroughly considered the parties’ arguments, the UPSO’s\nrecommendations, Mr. Robertson’s Form l3 Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) and the\ninformation contained therein about his criminal history and prior performance on release, and the\napplicable law. Although the government’s concerns are understandable, the Court ultimately\nbelieves that it can reasonably assure Mr. Robertson’s appearance and the safety of the community\nby releasing him to La Pasada Halfway House under a number of extremely strict and carefully\ntailored conditions.\n\nUnder l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e), a defendant must be released pending trial unless, after a\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooool296\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001297.jpg": "Gaseel2l\\7/oroo 2artauivient DocumMdil B62 Fileth62o6/PhgP aye of 6656\n\nhearing, a judicial officer finds that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions will reasonably\nassure the defendant’s appearance as required and the safety of any other person and the\ncommunity. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The government bears the burden of proving flight risk by\na preponderance of the evidence and dangerousness to any other person or the community by clear\nand convincing evidence. United States v. Cisneros, 328 F.3d 6lo, 6l6 (loth Cir. 2oo3). A district\ncourt’s review of a Magistrate Judge’s order of detention is de novo. See Cisneros, 328 F.3d at\n6l6.\n\nSection 3l42(e)(2) creates a rebutable presumption that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combinations of\nconditions exist to reasonably assure a defendant’s appearance or the safety of the community\nwhere there is probable cause to believe the defendant violated l8 U.S.C. § 924(c). See l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(e)(3)(B). As the Tenth Circuit has held:\n\nOnce the presumption is invoked, the burden of production shifts to the defendant.\n\nHouever, the burden of persuasion regarding risk-of-flight and danger to the\n\ncommunity always remains with the government. The defendant’s burden of\n\nproduction is not heavy, but some evidence must be produced. Even if a\n\ndefendant’s burden of production is met, the presumption remains a factor for\n\nconsideration by the district court in determining whether to release or detain.\nUnited States v. Stricklin, 932 F.2d l353, l354-55 (loth Cir. l99l).\n\nHere, although Mr. Robertson is subject to a presumption of detention due to his § 924(c)\ncharge, see Doc. 86 at l—2, the Court finds that he has successfully rebuted the presumption. He\nhas produced evidence, for example, that he is not a danger to the community nor a flight risk\nbecause he voluntarily turned himself in on the instant offense, despite consistently maintaining\nhis innocence and knouing the extremely long prison sentence he faced if convicted. Doc. 274 at\n5. He has also produced evidence that he will not flee the jurisdiction due to his family’s presence\nhere. Jd. And he has produced evidence that his placement at La Pasada Halfway House is a\n<span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> of release that could reasonably assure his appearance and the safety of the community.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool297\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001298.jpg": "Gaseel2l\\7 /oroo 2axtauivient DocumMdil B62 Fileth662o6/PhgPage & 6656\nDoc. 284 at 2-3. Mr. Robertson has met his burden of production and has rebuted the presumption\nin § 3l42(e)(3)(B) that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions could meet the requirements for\nhis release.\n\nSection 3l42(g) then lays out the follouing factors for courts to consider: (l) the nature\nand circumstances of the offense charged, including whether the offense is a crime of violence, a\nviolation of § l59l, a Federal crime of terrorism, or involves a minor victim or a controlled\nsubstance, firearm, explosive, or destructive device; (2) the weight of the evidence against the\ndefendant; (3) the history and characteristics of the defendant; and (4) the nature and seriousness\nof the danger to any person or community that would be posed by the defendant’s release. l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nThe Court finds that although some of these factors weigh against Mr. Robertson’s release,\nthey do not foreclose relief under the strict conditions the Court has imposed. With regard to the\nnature and circumstances of the offenses charged, they are extremely serious and involve Mr.\nRobertson allegedly shooting a victim, D.S., in retaliation for his cooperation with the government\nin an earlier criminal case. As the Court stated at the November 4, 2o2l pretrial conference, it\ntakes Mr. Robertson’s charges extremely seriously because the ability of witnesses to come\nforward and safely provide information to the government, and to the Court, is at the core of our\ncriminal justice system.\n\nWith regard to the weight of the evidence against Mr. Robertson, it is mixed. On the one\nhand, D.S. positively identified Mr. Robertson as the person who shot him and at least one other\nwitness, N.F., has testified that Mr. Robertson made incriminating statements in the weeks prior\nto the shooting. On the other hand, it appears that there were many people present at the time and\nplace of the shooting and there is evidence that D.S.’s identification of Mr. Robertson could have\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- ooool298\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001299.jpg": "Gaseel2l\\7/oroo 2artauivient DocumMdil B62 Fileth662o6/PhgPage GF 6656\nbeen influenced by the suggestion of others, including his girlfriend at the time and the police who\ncame to question him in the hospital.\n\nWith regard to Mr. Robertson’s history and characteristics, his history of violating past\nconditions of release is a source of concern, as the Court noted when denying him release last\nSeptember. See supra at 4. More specifically, Mr. Robertson’s Form l3 PSR notes several\ninstances in which his probation was revoked for failure to comply with conditions of release.\nDoc. l88 at 8-lo. Mr. Robertson also has several prior convictions. /d. Houever, as the defense\nhas pointed out, none of Mr. Robertson’s probation revocations appear to have involved him\nabsconding; although he has convictions for illegal firearm possession, he does not have any\nconvictions for violent offenses; and he turned himself after being charged in the instant case. /d.;\nsee also Doc. 274 at 4-5.\n\nFinally, with regard to the nature and seriousness of the danger that would be posed to any\nperson or the community by Mr. Robertson’s release, the Court understands the government’s\nconcerns given the frightening allegations in this case. Mr. Robertson is presumed innocent on all\ncharges until proven guilty, houever. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42() (“Nothing in this section shall be\nconstrued as modifying or limiting the presumption of innocence.”). Presuming Mr. Robertson’s\ninnocence in this case, while he is someone who has been convicted of gun and drug offenses and\nhas failed to comply with conditions of release in the past, he is not someone with a proven history\nof violent behavior.” Nor is the Court persuaded by the government’s vague suggestions that Mr.\nRobertson might have tried to contact or intimidate witnesses in this case because it has provided\nno concrete or specific evidence to substantiate any such claims. For example, the government’s\ncryptic report that witness N.F. was allegedly contacted by an unnamed individual about this case\n* While Mr. Robertson does have prior arrests for violent offenses, these charges were all dismissed and are\ntherefore unproven allegations. See Doc. l88 at ll-l5.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooool299\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001300.jpg": "Casse :27-C€r-O2o48uMenIDicanehO3O@ 2File@ O2Io6/AIageage HO F5l6\nis not a valid reason to deny Mr. Robertson release because the government has not come forward\nwith any details to corroborate N.F.’s account or to link Mr. Robertson to the alleged contact.\n\nMore importantly, the Court has imposed a number of extremely strict and carefully\ntailored conditions of release that it believes will be more than sufficient to reasonably assure Mr.\nRobertson’s appearance and the safety of the community. Mr. Robertson will be placed at La\nPasada Halfway House, where he will be on home incarceration with active GPS tracking, the\nstrictest form of location monitoring available to the Court. Doc. 3ol at 2. He will not be alloued\nto leave La Pasada for any reason other than to meet with his atorneys, and he will not be alloued\nto transport himself to those meetings; his atorneys will have to transport him. /d. He will not be\nalloued any visitors at La Pasada except for his atorneys. /d. He will not be alloued to use or\npossess a cellphone, nor to borrou anyone else’s cellphone. /d. He will not be alloued to use the\nlandline at La Pasada, except to speak to his atorneys. /d. He will not be alloued to have contact\nwith anyone other than his Pretrial Services officer and his atorneys. /d. That includes no contact\nwith his family members until he shous the Court that he is fully compliant with all of his\nconditions of release. /d. He will not be alloued to use or possess drugs or alcohol. /d. He will\nbe alloued to participate in counseling at La Pasada to help him cope with the stress of his looming\ntrial. Jd. He will be required to abide by all rules and regulations of the halfway house, houever\nsmall. Jd.\n\nThe Court believes that with all of these conditions, and under the close supervision of the\nstaff at La Pasada and his Pretrial Services officer, Mr. Robertson will not pose a danger to the\ncommunity or a risk of flight. The Court also cautioned Mr. Robertson at the February 4, 2o2l\npretrial conference that if he violates any of these conditions of release, the Court will not hesitate\nto reincarcerate him immediately. The Court accordingly finds that there are conditions, or a\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool3oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001301.jpg": "Cass :27-CrO2o48 UMM nIDechMehD3OW 2FileoO2l66/A2adedge bi HFl6\ncombination of conditions, that will reasonably assure Mr. Robertson’s appearance and the safety\nof any person and the community. His pretrial release is therefore required by l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e).\n\nlil. Mr. Robertson’s Release is Necessary for the Preparation of His Trial Defense\nUnder l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i).\n\nThe Court additionally finds that Mr. Robertson’s release is necessary for the preparation\nof his trial defense under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i). That section allous a judicial officer who issued an\norder of detention to, by subsequent order, “permit the temporary release of the person, in the\ncustody of a United States marshal or another appropriate person, to the extent that the judicial\nofficer determines such release to be necessary for preparation of the person’s defense or for\nanother compelling reason.” § 3l42(i).2 The defendant bears the burden of establishing their\nentitlement to temporary release under § 3l42(i). United States v. Clark, 448 F. Supp. 3d ll52,\nll55 (D. Kan. 2o2o) (citation omited). Courts considering whether pretrial release is necessary\nfor the preparation of the person’s defense have considered: “(l) [the] time and opportunity the\ndefendant has to prepare for the trial and to participate in his defense; (2) the complexity of the\ncase and volume of information; and (3) expense and inconvenience associated with preparing\nwhile incarcerated.” United States v. Boatwright, ---F. Supp. 3d---, No. 2:l9-CR-oo3ol-GMN-\nDJA, 2o2o WL l639855, at *4 (D. Nev. Apr. 2, 2o2o) (unreported) (citations omited).\n\nHere, all of those factors weigh in favor of release. Because Mr. Robertson’s trial will be\nreset for April 5, 2o2l, he and his defense team have only two months left to prepare.\n> While the Court recognizes that Magistrate Judge Briones is the judicial officer that issued Mr.\nRobertson’s initial order of detention, this mater is before the Court on Mr. Robertson’s request that the\nCourt review that detention order under l8 U.S.C. § 3l45(b). See Doc. 274 at l. The Tenth Circuit has not\nyet ruled on whether a request for temporary release under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i) can only be decided by the\nMagistrate Judge that issued the initial order of detention. See United States v. Alderete, 336 F.R.D. 24o,\n268 (D.N.M. 2o2o). But at least one other federal district court has recently considered and granted pretrial\nrelease under that section. See United States v. Stephens, 447 F. Supp. 3d 63, 66-68 (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o)\n(Nathan, J.); but see Alderete, 336 F.R.D. at 268.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooool3ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001302.jpg": "Cass :27-Cr-O2o48 UMM nIDechmMehO3SO@) 2Fileo O2l66/Atadedge b? HI6\nComplicating maters further is the fact that both of Mr. Robertson’s initial defense atorneys have\nrecently withdrawn from the case, and both of his current atorneys have been appointed within\nthe past six months (one in the last three weeks). The defense team therefore has a considerable\namount of catching up to do in a very short amount of time, and defense counsel need to\nimmediately begin meeting with Mr. Robertson on a regular basis. The case is also complex and\nexceedingly serious. The government has named 24 witnesses on its most recent witness list [Doc.\nlo4] and the Court has issued upwards of 3o writen orders over the past three years of contentious\npretrial litigation in this case. And if Mr. Robertson is convicted on all charges, he will be facing\ndecades in prison: according to his Form l3 PSR, Mr. Robertson’s effective guidelines range\nwould be a staggering 4l2 to 485 months of imprisonment, or approximately 34 to 4o years. See\nDoc. l88 at l5.\n\nFinally, defense counsel explained at the recent pretrial conference that it will be\nimpossible for them to effectively prepare the case for trial with Mr. Robertson in custody under\nthe current lockdoun conditions due to COVID-l9. In normal times, defense counsel can meet\nwith their clients face to face in meeting rooms at the jails, where they can review discovery and\ndo other critical trial preparation. Nou, houever, if the jails are allouing in-person client meetings\nat all, itis with the defendants separated from their counsel by a screen, making it nearly impossible\nto effectively review documentary evidence. And while defense counsel represented that the Santa\nFe County Detention Center is allouing video meetings by Zoom, it is hard to schedule Zoom time\ndue to the limited number of computer facilities at the jail and the number of parties vying for them\n(including this Court). Defense counsel also represented that while the Zoom meetings have been\nhelpful, the Detention Center has not alloued them to shou Mr. Robertson documents by sharing\ntheir screen, requiring counsel to instead hold the documents up to their computer’s camera in the\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR- ooool3o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001324.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page/ of 25\nAlthough the defense argued that Maxwell did not leave the United States after\nEpstein’s arrest and was in contact with the Government through counsel, Judge\nNathan emphasized that Maxwell “did not provide the government with her\nwhereabouts,” and, in any event, “the reality that Ms. Maxwell may face such serious\ncharges herself may not have set in until after she was actually indicted.” (/d. at 84-\n85).\n\nl4. Accordingly, Judge Nathan found that the Government had\ncarried its burden of demonstrating that Maxwell “poses a substantial actual risk of\nflight” and that “even the most restrictive conditions of release would be\ninsufficient” to ensure Maxwell’s appearance.

She also rejected Maxwell’s comparison to certain other high-profile\ndefendants, citing “crucial factual differences” in those cases. (/d. at 88).\n\nl5.

Judge Nathan found that the arguments presented “either were\nmade at the initial bail hearing or could have been made then” and the new\ninformation “only solidifies the Court’s view that [Maxwell] plainly poses a risk of\nflight and that no combination of conditions can ensure her appearance.” (Ex.

That lack of candor raises\n\nsignificant concerns as to whether the Court has nou been\n\nprovided a full and accurate picture of her finances and as\n\nto the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\n\nconditions of release.\n\n(Id. at l6).\n\n2l. Judge Nathan again concluded that Maxwell presented a risk of\nflight and that Maxwell’s proposed bail package “cannot reasonably assure her\nappearance,” as it “would leave unrestrained millions of dollars and other assets that\nshe could sell in order to support herself’ and the “proposed bond is only partially\nsecured.” (/d. at l6-l8). Judge Nathan explained that the pledge of several third\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooool328\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001329.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel2 of 25\n\nparties to support Maxwell’s bond did not alter this conclusion because “the amount\nof wealth that she would retain were she to flee, in addition to contingent assets and\nfuture income streams that are not accounted for in the bail package, would plausibly\nenable her to compensate them, in part or in full, for their losses.” (/d. at l8). Judge\nNathan also rejected Maxwell’s proposed conditions of release to a relative’s\ncustody and private security guards, reiterating her concern regarding Maxwell’s\n“extraordinary capacity to evade detection.” (/d. at l8-l9).\n\n22. Finally, Judge Nathan was “unpersuaded” by Maxwell’s\nargument “that the conditions of her confinement are uniquely onerous, interfere\nwith her ability to participate in her defense, and thus justify release.” (/d. at 2o).\nMaxwell did not “meaningfully dispute” that she has received more time than other\ninmates at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) to review discovery and as\nmuch, if not more, time to communicate with her lawyers. (/d.). Judge Nathan\nreiterated that she would continue to ensure that Maxwell is able to speak and meet\nregularly with her atorneys and review discovery to prepare her defense. (/d. at 2o\nn.3).\n\nD. = The Third Bail Application\n\n23. On February 23, 2o2l, Maxwell filed a third bail application,\n\nproposing two additional bail conditions: (l) renunciation of her French and British\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool329\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001330.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel3 of 25\ncitizenship; and (2) placement of a portion of her and her spouse’s assets in a new\naccount to be overseen by a monitor. (Ex. I). After considering multiple writen\nsubmissions (Ex. I, J, K), Judge Nathan denied Maxwell’s request in another writen\nopinion. (Ex. L).\n\n24. Judge Nathan concluded that Maxwell’s new application did not\ndisturb her prior conclusions. (/d. at 2). She reiterated that detention was warranted\nin light of the proffered strength and nature of the Government’s case, Maxwell’s\n“substantial international ties, familial and personal connections abroad, substantial\nfinancial resources, and experience evading detection,” and Maxwell’s “lack of\ncandor regarding her assets” at the time of her arrest. (/d. at 7).\n\n25. Judge Nathan rejected Maxwell’s argument that the strength of\nthe evidence was diminished by Maxwell’s pending pre-trial motions. (/d. at 5-6).\nShe also rejected the two additional conditions proposed by Maxwell, noting the\n“Tclonsiderable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the\n[foreign citizenship] renunciations,” and finding that, despite the proposed\nmonitorship, Maxwell “would continue to have access to substantial assets—\ncertainly enough to enable her flight and to evade prosecution.” (/d. at lo-ll).

Judge Nathan’s Oversight of Maxwell’s Conditions of\n\nConfinement\n\n26. Asshe indicated she would, Judge Nathan has closely monitored\nMaxwell’s conditions of confinement, including by ordering the Government to\nsubmit regular updates regarding that topic (see Gov’t Ex. A (compiling update\nleters and relevant court orders)), and, in one instance, ordering the MDC to provide\nMaxwell access to a Government-issued laptop on weekends and holidays (see id.\nat lo-ll). The Government most recently filed such an update on April 6, 2o2l,\nnoting, among other things, Maxwell’s extensive access to discovery and\ncommunications with counsel; her regular access to outdoor recreation; the thirteen\nhours per day during which she is brought to a day room outside of her cell with\nexclusive access to a television, a phone, two computers, and a shouer; and her\naccess to medical care, including the COVID-l9 vaccine, which she has nou\nreceived.

Judge Nathan did not clearly err when she determined that\nMaxwell is a risk of flight and that no conditions would reasonably assure her\nappearance in court. Nor did Judge Nathan abuse her discretion or clearly err by\ndenying Maxwell’s request for temporary release.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n28. In seeking pretrial detention, the Government bears the burden\nof shouing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight, and that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions would reasonably assure\nher presence in court. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f); United States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d\n63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7).\n\n29. Where the defendant is charged with certain offenses, including\noffenses involving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, a statutory\npresumption arises “that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions will reasonably\nassure the appearance of the person as required... .” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). In\nsuch a case, the defendant “bears a limited burden of production—not a burden of\npersuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he\ndoes not pose a ... risk of flight.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool332\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001334.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel7 of 25\ndetermines such release to be necessary for preparation of the person’s defense or\nfor another compelling reason.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(l). The defendant bears the burden\nof shouing that temporary release is necessary. See United States v. Scarborough,\n82l F. App’x 598, 6oo (6th Cir. 2o2o); United States v. Belardo, No. 2o Cr. l26\n(LTS), 2o2o WL l689789, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 7, 2o2o).

App’x 852, 853 n.3\n(2d Cir. 2o2l).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nl. The District Court Did Not Clearly Err By Denying Bail\n\n33. Judge Nathan did not commit clear error in finding, three times,\nthat the Government established by a preponderance of the evidence that Maxwell\nis a risk of flight and no bail conditions could reasonably assure her appearance in\ncourt. In three detailed, thorough decisions, rendered after hearing lengthy argument\nand receiving multiple rounds of briefing, Judge Nathan explained that detention\nwas appropriate in light of the nature and circumstances of the offense, which carry\na presumption of detention; the strength of the Government’s proffered evidence,\nwhich was based on multiple victims and contemporaneous documentary\ncorroboration; and Maxwell’s history and characteristics, including her substantial\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool334\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001337.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page2o of 25\n\nconcerns about her foreign citizenship or substantial assets (Br. 24-25), but Judge\nNathan thoroughly analyzed these assertions and, after multiple rounds of briefing\nregarding the efficacy of Maxwell’s proposed package, was not persuaded. (Ex. H\nat ll-l4; Ex. L at 8-ll). Maxwell atempts to compare herself to other high-profile\ndefendants (Br. 25), but Judge Nathan rejected the comparison, noting “crucial\nfactual differences” in several of these cases (Ex. D at 88) and making extensive\nfindings about the particular facts and circumstances of this case that make detention\nappropriate. None of this was clear error.\n\n2. The District Court Did Not Clearly Err or Abuse Its Discretion by\n\nDenying Temporary Release\n\n37. Maxwell also argues that she should be temporarily released—\nthough she specifies no end date—because she cannot effectively prepare her\ndefense under the conditions of her confinement. (Br. l3-l9). Judge Nathan did not\nabuse her discretion or clearly err by concluding otherwise.° To the contrary, Judge\nNathan has gone to significant lengths to ensure that Maxwell has adequate access\nto her counsel and opportunity to prepare her defense.\n° As noted, this Court has not resolved which standard of review applies to such an\napplication. The Government submits that the decision of whether temporary release\nis “necessary” is a mixed question of law and fact which, like the district court’s bail\ndetermination, should be reviewed for clear error. See United States v. Matis, 963\nF.3d 285, 29l (2d Cir. 2o2o). The Court need not resolve the mater here, houever,\nas Maxwell’s claim fails under either standard of review.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooool337\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001338.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page2l of 25\n\n38. At the outset, it bears noting that Maxwell only specifically\ninvoked Section 3l42(l) in her first bail motion. (Ex. B at 5-9). Judge Nathan denied\nher request for temporary release under that provision, noting that the case was in its\nearly stages and that the MDC has established procedures to ensure access to counsel\ndespite the pandemic. (Ex. D at 89-9o). Nevertheless, Judge Nathan ordered the\nGovernment to work with the defense to ensure adequate access to counsel and\ninvited Maxwell to make further applications if the accommodations were\n“inadequate in any way.” (/d. at 9o-9l). Maxwell did not appeal Judge Nathan’s first\ndetention order. Instead, she repeatedly availed herself of the invitation to raise\nconcerns about her access to counsel, and Judge Nathan responded with significant\noversight of Maxwell’s conditions of confinement. (See Gov’t Ex. A). Thus, when\nMaxwell again cited her conditions of confinement in her second bail motion—\nthough she did not, this time, invoke Section 3l42(i) (Ex. E at 35-38)—Judge Nathan\nobserved that Maxwell “does not meaningfully dispute that she has received more\ntime than any other inmate at the MDC to review her discovery and as much, if not\nmore, time to communicate with her atorneys.” (Ex. H at 2o). And, again, Judge\nNathan made clear that she would “continue to ensure” that Maxwell has such\naccommodations as are necessary to prepare her defense and invited Maxwell to\nmake further applications. V/d. at 2o n.3). Judge Nathan continued to oversee\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooool338\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001339.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page22 of 25\nMaxwell’s access to counsel, and Maxwell did not renew her request for temporary\nrelease in her third bail motion.’\n\n39. Under these circumstances, Judge Nathan can hardly be said to\nhave abused her discretion by finding that temporary release is not “necessary” for\nMaxwell to prepare her defense. “Temporary release is not warranted when a\ndefendant has had ample time to prepare his defense.” Scarborough, 82l F. App’x\nat 6ol. That is the case here. Maxwell is represented by a team of highly qualified,\nretained counsel, and has resources to prepare her defense far beyond those of the\naverage defendant. Maxwell has access to a desktop computer provided by the MDC\nand a laptop provided by the Government for Maxwell’s exclusive use to review\ndiscovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. (Ex. F at 29-3o; Gov’t Ex. A\nat l7-l8). Also during that time, Maxwell has access to email with defense counsel,\ncalls with defense counsel, and legal visits (depending on pandemic-related\nconditions). (Ex. F at 29-3o; Gov’t Ex. A at l8-l9). Maxwell currently receives\n7 Thus, to the extent Maxwell’s arguments about her ability to prepare for trial are\ntied to any developments since the time of her first bail motion—such as, for\nexample, the imminency of trial (see Br. l7)—this Court need not address such\narguments in the first instance.

(Gov’t Ex.\nA at l8).\n\n4o. Given these accommodations, Maxwell’s argument amounts to a\nsuggestion that any defendant in a case with voluminous discovery must be released\non bail to prepare for trial, regardless of flight risk or danger to the community. That\ncannot be the law. Rather, “[i]n considering whether there is a ‘compelling reason’\nfor a defendant’s release under [Section 3l42(l)], a court must balance the reasons\nadvanced for such release against the risks that were previously identified and\nresulted in an order of detention.” United States v. Chambers, No. 2o Cr. l35 (JMF),\n2o2o WL l53o746, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 3l, 2o2o). Here, that balance emphatically\nfavors detention, given Judge Nathan’s repeated findings about risk of flight and the\nsubstantial accommodations made to ensure Maxwell’s ability to prepare her\ndefense.\n\n4l. The risks presented by COVID-l9 do not alter this conclusion.\nNot only does Maxwell have no underlying conditions that place her at heightened\nrisk of complications from COVID-l9 (Ex. D at 89-9o; Ex. H at 2l), but she nou\nhas been fully vaccinated (Gov’t Ex. A at l9, 2l).

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter to provide an update regarding the\ndefendant’s conditions of confinement at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) pursuant to\nthe Court’s Order dated August 25, 2o2o. (Dkt. No. 49). Over the past three months, the\nGovernment has had multiple conversations with MDC legal counsel regarding the defendant’s\nconditions of confinement. This update is based on information provided to the Government by\nMDC legal during those conversations.\n\nLast week, a staff member who was assigned to work in the area of the MDC where the\ndefendant is housed tested positive for COVID-l9. In response, the MDC implemented the same\nquarantine protocols that apply whenever an inmate has potentially been exposed to the virus.\nSpecifically, on November l8, 2o2o, the defendant was tested for COVID-l9 using a rapid test,\nwhich was negative. That same day, the defendant was placed in quarantine. As with any other\nquarantined inmate, the defendant will remain in quarantine for fourteen days, at which point she\nwill be tested again for COVID-l9. If that test is negative, she will then be released from\nquarantine. To date, the defendant has not exhibited any symptoms of COVID-l9.\n\nDuring her time in quarantine, the defendant will be housed in the same cell where she was\nalready housed before she was placed in quarantine, and medical staff and psychology staff will\ncontinue to check on the defendant every day. Like all other MDC inmates in quarantine, the\ndefendant will be permited out of her cell three days per week for thirty minutes. During that\ntime, the defendant may shouer, make personal phone calls, and use the CorrLinks email system.\nIn addition, the defendant will continue to be permited to make legal calls every day for up to\nthree hours per day. These calls will take place in a room where the defendant is alone and where\nno MDC staff can hear her communications with counsel.\n\nOn November l8, 2o2o, the Government provided the MDC with a laptop for the defendant\nto use to review discovery. During quarantine, the defendant has been and will continue to be\npermited to use that laptop in her isolation cell to review her discovery for thirteen hours per day,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001344.jpg": "Casest:2o-cr/oo8aGAU Ant Boeument 72o FileaOVH26R o aPage ka 2\nPage 2\nseven days per week. Accordingly, the defendant is receiving the same amount of time to review\nher discovery and the same amount of time to speak with her lawyers as she received before\nentering quarantine. The defendant will not, houever, be permited to meet in person with her\nlawyers until she tests out of quarantine.\n\nAfter the defendant tests out of quarantine, she will resume the same schedule that the\nMDC implemented approximately three months ago. Specifically, from 7am to 8pm every day,\nthe defendant will be permited out of her isolation cell. During those thirteen hours, the defendant\nwill have access to a computer on which to review her discovery outside of her cell. Also during\nthe day, the defendant will be permited to, among other things, make legal calls, make personal\ncalls, access CorrLinks, and shouer. From 8pm to 7am, the defendant will remain in her isolation\ncell. The defendant will also be permited to have in-person visits with her atorneys up to three\ndays per week for multiple hours per visit. On days when the defendant does not have in-person\nlegal visits, she will have access to legal calls for up to three hours per day.\n\nAs was the case three months ago, the defendant continues to have more time to review her\ndiscovery than any other inmate at the MDC, even while in quarantine. The defendant also has as\nmuch, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to communicate with her atorneys, even while\nin quarantine.\n\nAs noted above, over the past three months, the Government has repeatedly communicated\nboth with MDC legal counsel and defense counsel regarding the defendant’s conditions of\nconfinement. Whenever the defense has raised a concern on this topic, the Government has\nimmediately contacted MDC legal counsel to inquire about and, where appropriate, to address the\nconcern. The Government will continue to keep those lines of communication open and will\nremain responsive to any concerns raised by the defense regarding the defendant’s conditions of\nconfinement.

(Dkt. No. 76). Over the past week, the Government has\nspoken with MDC legal counsel regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement and has tried\nto gather additional information regarding the concerns raised by the defendant, which the\nGovernment has shared with defense counsel. The Government has also conferred with defense\ncounsel three times regarding the same, as well as the defense’s request relating to MDC Warden\nHeriberto Tellez. The parties have been unable to reach agreement. Our respective positions\nfollou.\n\nThe Government respectfully submits that the Court should allou MDC legal counsel to\nrespond directly in writing to the Court and defense counsel regarding the concerns defense\ncounsel has raised relating to the defendant’s conditions of confinement. The Government\nunderstands that MDC legal counsel is prepared to submit a leter by this Friday, December 4,\n2o2o. Such a leter is the appropriate next step at this time, as it will allou the Court to hear\ndirectly from MDC legal counsel who can address the defendant’s conditions of confinement. The\nleter will allou the Court to ascertain whether further inquiry, including a personal appearance by\nthe Warden or other MDC personnel, is necessary. Moreover, the Government does not\nunderstand the concerns raised by the defense to implicate the defendant’s access to legal materials\nor her ability to communicate with her counsel. As noted in the Government’s leter dated\nNovember 23, 2o2o, the defendant continues to have more time to review her discovery than any\nother inmate at the MDC. The defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC\ninmate to communicate with her atorneys. (Dkt. No. 74).\n\nThe defense disagrees. As communicated to the Government, the defense’s position is as\nfollous: Warden Heriberto Tellez should appear before the Court to directly address concerns\nregarding Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement, which specifically target her.

Specifically, the defendant is permited to review her discovery thirteen hours per\nday, seven days per week. During the entirety of that time, the defendant has access to a desktop\ncomputer provided by the MDC on which to review discovery. Additionally, pursuant to the\nCourt’s January l5, 2o2l Order, the defendant also has access to a laptop computer provided by\nthe Government on which to review discovery for the full thirteen hours per day, seven days per\nweek. Also during those thirteen hours per day, the defendant may use the MDC desktop computer\nto send and receive emails with her atorneys.\n\nThe defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to\ncommunicate with her atorneys. Due to the elevated number of COVID-l9 cases within the MDC,\nin-person visits have been suspended since in or about December 2o2o. While in-person visits are\nsuspended, the defendant has had regular video-teleconference (“VTC”) calls with her counsel. In\nparticular, the defendant has VTC calls with her counsel every weekday for three hours per call.\nIf defense counsel requires additional time to speak with the defendant, counsel may request to\nschedule an additional phone call on Saturdays as needed. All of these VTCs and telephone calls\ntake place in a room where the defendant is alone and where no MDC staff can hear her\ncommunications with counsel.\n\nThe defendant’s legal mail is processed in the same manner as mail for all other inmates at\nthe MDC.

This self-serving proclamation is no\nsubstitute for evidence. The prosecutors who filed the leter do not even\nclaim to have watched the video.

This past weekend there\nwas a pervasive stench of sewage in Ms. Maxwell’s unit necessitating guards to flush pipes by\npouring water doun open drains in an effort to trap and disperse gaseous emissions. As guards\nexplained to Ms. Maxwell, there are three drains in the day area, and when the plumbing system\ngoes unused, gases escape from the drains and cause the stench. At times the stench in Ms.\nMaxwell’s isolation cell has been overwhelming due to overflouing of toilets in the cellblock\nabove. Due to lack of privacy, Ms. Maxwell refrains from using the toilet in the isolation cell\nand, as directed by the guards, she flushes frequently to avoid plumbing problems.

She is weighed while\nclothed on scales that are erratic and not set to zero; on at least one occasion, the scale was set\nabove five pounds. Her eyesight is failing, and her hair is thinning. The guards are far from\nqualified to assess Ms. Maxwell’s physical <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>.\n\nReleasing any inmate’s medical information (i.e., weight, vaccinations, etc.) without\ninmate consent is a HIPAA violation.

The government, ever protective of sensitive items of\ndiscovery that relate to the alleged victims, should exhibit the same concern for Ms. Maxwell’s\nright to privacy.\n\nThe incident of physical abuse which occurred when Ms. Maxwell was shoved into her\nisolation cell to be searched was previously reported to MDC Legal and the Court and\ninvestigated within the facility. The guard responsible for the abuse is a member of a rotating\nteam that has been the subject of complaint, yet some members were reassigned to Ms. Maxwell\nfor the past two weeks. The incident at issue occurred when Ms. Maxwell was facing forward in\nfront of an officer whose back was in front of the handheld camera. On information and belief,\nthe camera was not recording at that time. The government disputes Ms. Maxwell’s claim by\nciting a video.

The computer equipment provided remains\ninadequate to review the millions of pages of discovery under circumstances that are not\nconducive to preparing for trial. It is unreasonable to believe that not being able to search, mark,\nsave, and print is sufficient to prepare this document-laden case for trial.

Upon due consideration, it is hereby ORDERED that the District Court’s orders\nare AFFIRMED and that Appellant’s motion for bail, or in the alternative, temporary pretrial\nrelease pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i), Dkt. 39, is DENIED. During oral argument, counsel for\nAppellant expressed concern that Appellant was improperly being deprived of sleep while\nincarcerated. To the extent Appellant seeks relief specific to her sleeping conditions, such request\nshould be addressed to the District Court.\nFOR THE COURT:\nCatherine O’Hagan Wolfe, Clerk of Court\nR ol fs\nDOJ-OGR-ooool4o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001409.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 7o-l, o5/l7/2o2l, 3lo245o, Page3 of l4\nAppellant Ghislaine Maxwell’s Renewed Motion for Bond\n\nAlthough this Court denied Ghislaine Maxwell’s motion for bond\n(see Ex. A, Order, April 27, 2o2l), it appeared concerned with the\nconditions of her confinement during oral argument and instructed Ms.\nMaxwell that “[t]lo the extent Appellant seeks relief specific to her\nsleeping conditions, such request should be addressed to the District\nCourt.” (Ud.).\n\nMs. Maxwell did just that, explaining again to the trial judge the\nerueling conditions of her confinement, which includes shining a\nflashlight in Ms. Maxwell’s eyes every l5 minutes, over the past 3l8 days\nin solitary confinement, even though she is not suicidal and even though\nno other inmate suffers such abuse. Ex. C, Doc. 256. The government\nresponded, Ex. D, and although it previously intimated that Ms. Maxwell\nmight be suicidal (she’s not), it nou said that the sleep deprivation was\njustified because she is housed alone, because of the nature of the\ncharges, and because the case is high-profile.

Ms. Maxwell\nreplied. Ex.

And\nthe horrific conditions make it impossible to prepare for trial.\nAccordingly, we renew our motion for bond and seek relief from this\nCourt. Ms. Maxwell simply wants a fair opportunity to fight the charges\nagainst her at trial.\n\nCurrently, she (l) can’t sleep because the guards wake her every l5\nminutes; (2) oftentimes can’t drink the water because it is broun and\ncontains particles; (3) can’t meet in person with her lawyers because the\nguards use a handheld camera to video and audio tape record the\nmeetings; (4) can’t manage the smell of overflouing sewage that comes\nup from the drain in her unit; (5) can’t keep the guards from seizing and\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool4lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001411.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 7o-l, o5/l7/2o2l, 3lo245o, Paged of l4\n\ngoing through her atorney-client materials; and (6) can’t search, print,\nhighlight, or sort the discovery because the “computer” she was given was\nstripped doun and does not have the proper software or hardware\ncapabilities. The truth is that Ms. Maxwell is not being treated in a\nhumane fashion and cannot prepare for trial under these horrific\nconditions. She has been in solitary confinement with no sleep for almost\na year. The presumption of innocence has been turned on its head. This\nCourt should either order her temporary release under l8 U.S.C. 3l42)\nor remand this mater and order the trial court to conduct an evidentiary\nhearing on the conditions of her confinement.\n\nIt is important to underscore that the government has made a\nnumber of representations to the trial court and to this Court about the\nconditions of Ms. Maxwell’s detention that have proven to be false.\n\nl. Government misrepresentation to the district court: “The\ndefendant wears an eye mask when she sleeps, limiting the disturbance\ncaused by the flashlight [every fifteen minutes].” Doc. l96 (April 6, 2o2l,\ngovt leter to district court).

So Ms.\nMaxwell tries to shield her eyes with a sock or touel.

But those reasons, individually or\ncollectively, do not justify torturing someone by depriving them of sleep.\nNevertheless, the district judge did not conduct a hearing or otherwise\nquestion BOP. It simply alloued the government to file a leter saying\nthat this is what was relayed to the government from the jail lawyer from\nthe jail guards. Even if that hearsay was true (which should be\nquestioned based on other representations made by BOP to the\ngovernment to the court), it is not at all sufficient for this type of\ntreatment.\n\n3.

This is an adversary system, of course. But\nwhen the government’s representations about the conditions of\nconfinement continue to be demonstrably and admitedly false, there\nneeds to be an intervention.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nDuring oral argument of Ghislaine Maxwell’s bail appeal before the Circuit, Ms.\nMaxwell’s appellate counsel expressed concern that she was improperly deprived of sleep while\ndetained in the MDC, an issue that has been raised in filings before this Court. In its brief denial\nof her appeal, the Circuit stated: “To the extent Appellant seeks relief specific to her sleeping\nconditions, such request should be addressed to the District Court.” See Exhibit A. We press our\nconcerns regarding disruption of Ms. Maxwell’s sleep and the deleterious effect sleep\ndeprivation is having on her health, well-being, and ability to prepare for and withstand trial.\n\nMs. Maxwell continues to be disrupted throughout the night by guards shining a\nflash/strobe light into her cell, claiming that her breathing must be checked. The myth that Ms.\nMaxwell’s conditions of confinement are related to her being a suicide risk was laid to rest\nduring the oral argument: There is nothing to support that contrived claim. In fact, Ms. Maxwell\nis classified with the standard CCl-Mh designation: inmate with no significant mental health\ncare. (See Dkt. l59 at 3.)\n\nContrary to the report that Ms. Maxwell “wears an eye mask when she sleeps” (Dkt. l96\nat 4), an item neither available for purchase through MDC commissary nor provided to her, she\nresorts to using a sock or touel to cover her eyes in an awkward atempt to shield them from\ndisrupting illumination every l5 minutes. Last night, she was confronted by MDC staff due a\nvisible bruise over her left eye. The “black eye” is depicted in Exhibit B. Despite 24/7 camera\nsurveillance (except when guards elect to exert authority in an intimidating way off-camera, as\nthey did in Saturday’s bathroom incident), no guard addressed the bruise until Ms. Maxwell, who\nhas no mirror, caught a reflection of her aching eye in the glean of a nail clipper. At that point,\nMDC staff confronted Ms. Maxwell regarding the source of the bruise, threatening to place her\nin the SHU if she did not reveal hou she got it. While Ms. Maxwell is unaware of the cause of\nthe bruise, as reported to medical and psych staff, she has groun increasingly reluctant to report\ninformation to the guards for fear of retaliation, discipline, and punitive chores. Houever, there\nis concern that the bruise may be related to the need for Ms. Maxwell to shield her eyes from the\nlights projected into her cell throughout the night.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool43o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001431.jpg": "CaSesb:2o-cr/oo8BG+AN Nt BEeuMeNt QRO2 FiletOw4/29o/PagPage Ras 4\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Judge\nNathan further noted that Maxwell “possesses extraordinary financial resources,”\nlacks “any dependents, significant family ties or employment in the United States,”\nand made representations to Pretrial Services about her finances that “likely do not\nprovide a complete and candid picture of the resources available.” (/d. at 83-84).\nAccordingly, Judge Nathan found that the Government had carried its burden of\ndemonstrating that Maxwell “poses a substantial actual risk of flight” and that “even\nthe most restrictive conditions of release would be insufficient” to ensure Maxwell’s\nappearance, especially in light of her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding [her\nfinancial] resources and herself.” (/d. at 86-87). Judge Nathan also rejected\nMaxwell’s arguments about the difficulty of preparing a defense while incarcerated,\nfinding that measures in place were sufficient to ensure Maxwell’s access to her\ncounsel. Judge Nathan directed the Government to work with the defense “to\nprovide adequate communication between counsel and client” and invited the\ndefense to make specific applications to the District Court for further relief if the\nprocess was “inadequate in any way.” (dd. at 9o-9l).\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooool446\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001447.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 73, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page/7 of 24\n\nl3. Second, on December 8, 2o2o, Maxwell renewed her request for\nbail, presenting a revised bail package with additional financial restrictions. (Ex.\nE). After considering multiple writen submissions (Ex. E, F, G), Judge Nathan\ndenied Maxwell’s application in a detailed writen opinion (Ex. H). Judge Nathan\nfound that the arguments presented “either were made at the initial bail hearing or\ncould have been made then” and the new information “only solidifies the Court’s\nview that [Maxwell] plainly poses a risk of flight and that no combination of\nconditions can ensure her appearance.” (Ex. H at l-2). Among other things,\nJudge Nathan concluded that the case against Maxwell “remains strong” in light of\nthe Government’s proffer of evidence. (/d. at lo). Judge Nathan further found\nthat Maxwell still had “substantial international ties,” “multiple foreign\ncitizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “extraordinary\nfinancial resources” that would still “provide her the means to flee the country and\nto do so undetected.” (/d. at ll-l3). Judge Nathan emphasized that Maxwell’s\n“natern of providing incomplete or erroneous information to the Court or to Pretrial\nServices bears significantly’ on her assessment of Maxwell’s history and\ncharacteristics. (/d. at l5). Judge Nathan therefore again concluded that Maxwell\npresented a risk of flight and that Maxwell’s proposed bail package “cannot\nreasonably assure her appearance.” (/d. at l6). Additionally, Judge Nathan was\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool447\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001448.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 73, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page8 of 24\n“unpersuaded” by Maxwell’s argument “that the conditions of her confinement are\nuniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and thus\njustify release.” (/d. at 2o). In particular, Maxwell did not “meaningfully\ndispute” that she has received more time than other inmates at the Metropolitan\nDetention Center (“MDC”) to review discovery and as much, if not more, time to\ncommunicate with her lawyers. (/d.).\n\nl4. Third, on February 23, 2o2l, Maxwell filed yet another bail\napplication, proposing two additional bail conditions. (Ex. I). After considering\nmultiple writen submissions (Ex. I, J, K), Judge Nathan denied Maxwell’s request\nin another writen opinion (Ex. L). Judge Nathan reiterated that detention was\nwarranted in light of the proffered strength and nature of the Government’s case,\nMaxwell’s “substantial international ties, familial and personal connections abroad,\nsubstantial financial resources, and experience evading detection,” and Maxwell’s\n“lack of candor regarding her assets” at the time of her arrest. (/d. at 7). Judge\nNathan noted, “If the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance, it would order her release.\nYet while her proposed bail package is substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable\nassurances.” (/d. at ll).\n\nl5.

Maxwell appealed Judge Nathan’s later two bail decisions. In\nconnection with that appeal, Maxwell also moved for pretrial release pending appeal.\nAfter receiving briefing and hearing oral argument, this Court affirmed Judge\nNathan’s bail decisions and denied Maxwell’s motion for pretrial release on April\n27, 2o2l. (Mot. Ex. A).

(Mot. Ex. E). At no point did Maxwell file an affidavit in\nsupport of her claims regarding the conditions of her confinement.\n\n2l. On May l4, 2o2l, Judge Nathan issued a writen decision\ndenying Maxwell’s request for an order directing the MDC to modify its nightime\nmonitoring schedule. (Mot. Ex. B). In reaching this decision, Judge Nathan\nnoted that Maxwell’s claim that MDC staff was shining a flashlight directly into her\neyes and disrupting her sleep was “unsupported by affidavit or other factual\nshouing.” (/d. atl).

Judge Nathan concluded that “nothing in the record plausibly\nestablishes that current protocols interfere with Maxwell’s ability to prepare for her\ntrial and communicate with her lawyers.” (/d.). Consistent with the atention she\nhas paid to Maxwell’s conditions of confinement throughout the pendency of this\ncase, Judge Nathan instructed the Government and the MDC “‘to continue to ensure\nthat Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols” that are “necessary for\nher safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors, and consistent\nwith the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees.” (/d.).\nARGUMENT\nMaxwell’s Motion Should Be Denied\n\n22.

It should be denied.\nA. Applicable Law\n\n23. When seeking pretrial detention, the Government bears the\nburden of shouing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant poses a\nrisk of flight, and that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions would reasonably\nassure her presence in court. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f); United States v. Sabhnani,\n493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7).\n\n24. Where the defendant is charged with certain offenses, including\noffenses involving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. 8§ 2422 or 2423, a statutory\npresumption arises “that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions will reasonably\nassure the appearance of the person as required....” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E).\nIn such a case, the defendant “bears a limited burden of production—not a burden\nof persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he\ndoes not pose .. . a risk of flight.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436\n(2d Cir. 2ool).\n\n25. Where the Government seeks detention based on flight risk, the\ncourt must consider: (l) “the nature and circumstances of the offense charged”; (2)\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool453\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001456.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 73, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Pagel6 of 24\n\nthe context of post-conviction bail proceedings, “given the findings that must be\nmade in order to warrant release, it is generally more appropriate that the motion be\nmade initially in the district court.” United States v. Hochevar, 2l4 F.3d 342, 344\n(2d Cir. 2ooo) (per curiam); see Fed. R. App. P. 9(a) (providing for appeals from\ndetention orders); cf. generally Stack v.

The Order Maxwell annexes to her\nmotion—an Order regarding security checks at the MDC (Mot. Ex. B)—ls not a bail\ndetermination, and Maxwell has not taken an appeal from that Order. See Fed. R.\nApp. P. 9(a) (requiring that a party appealing a detention order must file “a copy of\nthe district court’s order . . . as soon as practicable after filing the notice of appeal’).\nNo bail determination is properly before this Court.\n\n3l. In any event, Maxwell’s “renewed motion” is substantively\nmeritless. This Court has already held that Judge Nathan did not commit clear error\nin finding, three times, that the Government established by a preponderance of the\nevidence that Maxwell is a risk of flight and no bail conditions could reasonably\nassure her appearance in court. This Court has also concluded that Judge Nathan\ndid not abuse her discretion or clearly err in determining that Maxwell’s conditions\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooool456\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001459.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 73, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Pagel9 of 24\nnightime checks involve shining a flashlight directly into her eyes (as opposed to\nthe ceiling), that the checks in fact disturb her sleep, or that the checks prevent her\nfrom being able to prepare her defense.*\n\n36. It bears emphasis that Maxwell’s appeal ostensibly concerns a\nmotion for pretrial release, such that the conditions of her confinement are relevant\nonly insofar as they affect her ability to prepare for trial. As this Court previously\nrecognized, the appropriate avenue for Maxwell to raise concerns about her ability\nto prepare for trial is through an application to the District Court. Maxwell availed\nherself of that process, but in so doing offered no evidence that the MDC’s security\nprotocols are unjustified or interfering with her preparation for trial. Tellingly,\n3 Maxwell repeatedly accuses the Government of making misrepresentations during\nthe course of this case. It is correct that the MDC informed the Government that\nMaxwell wore an eye mask at night, when in fact she uses other non-contraband\nitems to cover her eyes. The Government conveyed the MDC’s imprecise language\nin an April 6, 2o2l leter to Judge Nathan but has since recognized and\nacknouledged the inaccuracy. The remaining accusations, houever, are\nunfounded. For example, Maxwell takes Government counsel’s statement at oral\nargument about nightime checks being “routine” out of context when claiming that\nit involved some representation that all inmates experience flashlight checks every\nl5 minutes. To the contrary, when asked whether the nightime checks were\nconducted at that interval for every inmate, Government counsel clarified, “I can’t\nspeak to what is done as to all inmates.” Only after conferring with the MDC did\nthe Government convey to Judge Nathan, and nou this Court, the MDC’s procedures\nfor nightime checks of all inmates. The Government has and will continue to\naccurately represent the information it receives from the MDC when necessary to\nrespond to Maxwell’s complaints or inquiries from the Court.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooool459\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001460.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 73, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page2o of 24\n\nMaxwell did not couch her most recent request to the District Court as an application\nfor pretrial release; instead, she sought an order directing the MDC to modify its\noperations or justify its procedures. In the absence of any evidence that the MDC’s\nprotocols interfered with Maxwell’s trial preparation, Judge Nathan acted well\nwithin her discretion in declining to order the MDC to alter its security measures.\nEven in so doing, Judge Nathan reiterated her commitment to monitoring Maxwell’s\nconditions of confinement and ensuring that they do not interfere with preparation\nfor trial. This series of events simply does not suggest that Judge Nathan abused\nher substantial discretion when denying Maxwell’s prior applications for bail or\ntemporary release.\n\n37. To the extent Maxwell nou raises new complaints about\nconditions at the MDC before this Court, such issues should be presented to the\nDistrict Court and reviewed by Judge Nathan. In any event, as was the case with\nher concerns about nightime security checks, Maxwell has offered no evidence to\nsupport her claim that these additional complaints are true or prevent her from\npreparing for trial. There is simply no evidence in the record beyond the bare\nassertions of counsel that MDC’s water is undrinkable, that the MDC provides\ninadequate food, that the MDC audio records legal visits, or that sewage overflous\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooool46o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001465.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 77, o6/o2/2o2l, 3ll22o7, Page‘ of l\nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\nFOR THE\nSECOND CIRCUIT\nAt a Stated Term of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, held at the\nThurgood Marshall United States Courthouse, 4o Foley Square, in the City of New York, on the\n2nd day of June, two thousand twenty-one.\nBefore: Pierre N.

As a result of her disturbing and callous conduct, Maxwell nou faces the very real\nprospect of serving many years in prison. The strength of the Government’s evidence and the\nsubstantial prison term the defendant would face upon conviction all create a strong incentive for\nthe defendant to flee. That risk is only amplified by the defendant’s extensive international ties,\nher citizenship in two foreign countries, her wealth, and her lack of meaningful ties to the United\nStates. In short, Maxwell has three passports, large sums of money, extensive international\nconnections, and absolutely no reason to stay in the United States and face the possibility of a\nlengthy prison sentence.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooool488\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001491.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document4 Filed o7/o2/2o Page 5of lo\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).

Discussion\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the defendant presents an extreme risk of flight, and\ntherefore she cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of detention in this case. Every\none of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances of the\noffense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant — counsel\nstrongly in favor of detention.\n\nA. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence\n\nThe “nature and circumstances” of this offense favor detention. As the Indictment alleges,\nthe defendant commited serious crimes involving the sexual exploitation of minors. See l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(g)(l) (specifically enumerating “whether the offense. . . involves a minor victim” as a\nfactor in bail applications). Indeed, the crimes of enticing and transporting minors for illegal sex\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool49l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001492.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document4 Filed o7/o2/2o Page 6of lo\nacts are so serious that both crimes carry a statutory presumption that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42\n(e)(3)(E). The defendant repeatedly engaged in this conduct, targeting girls as young as l4 years\nold, for a period of years, and involving multiple minors.\n\nThese offenses carry significant penalties, and the defendant faces up to 35 years’\nimprisonment if convicted. The possibility of a substantial sentence is a significant factor in\nassessing the risk of flight. See United States v. Moscaritolo, No. lo Cr. 4 (JL), 2olo WL 3o9679,\nat *2 (D.N.H. Jan. 26, 2olo) (“[T]he steeper the potential sentence, the more probable the flight\nrisk is, especially considering the strong case of the government .. . .”) (quoting United States v.\nAlindato—Perez, 627 F. Supp. 2d 58, 66 (D.P.R. 2oo9)). Here, the defendant is facing a statutory\nmaximum of decades in prison. This fact alone would provide a compelling incentive for anyone\nto flee from prosecution, but the incentive to flee is especially strong for this defendant, who, at\nage 58, faces the very real prospect of spending a substantial portion of the rest of her life in prison.\n\nThe strength of the evidence in this case underscores the risk that the defendant will become\na fugitive. As the facts set forth in the Indictment make plain, the evidence in this case is strong.\nMultiple victims have provided detailed, credible, and corroborated information against the\ndefendant. The victims are backed up contemporaneous documents, records, witness testimony,\nand other evidence. For example, flight records, diary entries, business records, and other evidence\ncorroborate the victims’ account of events. This will be compelling evidence of guilt at any trial\nin this case, which weighs heavily in favor of detention.\n\nThe passage of time between the defendant’s conduct and these charges does not counsel\notherwise. As an initial mater, all of the conduct is timely charged, pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3283,\nwhich was amended in 2oo3 to extend the limitations period for conduct that was timely as of the\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool492\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001495.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document4 Filed o7/o2/2o Page 9 of lo\n\nThe defendant’s international connections and significant financial means would present a\nclear risk of flight under normal circumstances, but in this case, the risk of flight is exacerbated by\nthe transient nature of defendant’s current lifestyle. In particular, the defendant has effectively\nbeen in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July\n2ol9. Thereafter, the defendant — who had previously made many public appearances — stopped\nappearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears\nthat she made intentional efforts to avoid detection, including moving locations at least twice,\nswitching her primary phone number (which she registered under the name ““G Max”) and email\naddress, and ordering packages for delivery with a different person listed on the shipping label.\nMost recently, the defendant appears to have been hiding on a l56-acre property acquired in an\nall-cash purchase in December 2ol9 (through a carefully anonymized LLC) in Bradford, New\nHampshire, an area to which she has no other knoun connections.\n\nThe defendant appears to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United\nStates. She has no children, does not reside with any immediate family members, and does not\nappear to have any employment that would require her to remain in the United States. Nor does\nshe appear to have any permanent ties to any particular location in the United States. As such, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of\novercoming the presumption of detention, because there are no bail conditions that could\nreasonably assure the defendant’s continued appearance in this case.\n\nIn particular, home confinement with electronic monitoring would be inadequate to\nmitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring\ndevice. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would merely reduce her head start\nshould she decide to flee. See United States v.

Mem.”).\n\nIt is difficult to recall a recent case that has garnered more public atention than the\ngovernment’s prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”). In July 2ol9, Epstein was indicted for\noffenses relating to sexual misconduct, amid overwhelming media atention focused on the\nnature of the charges and Epstein’s wealth and lifestyle. On August lo, 2ol9, Epstein died in\nfederal custody, and the media focus quickly shifted to our client—wrongly trying to substitute\nher for Epstein—even though she’d had no contact with Epstein for more than a decade, had\nnever been charged with a crime or been found liable in any civil litigation, and has always\ndenied any allegations of claimed misconduct. Many of these stories and online posts were\nthreatening and harassing to our client and those close to her.\n\nBut sometimes the simplest point is the most critical one: Ghislaine Maxwell is not\nJeffrey Epstein. She was not named in the government’s indictment of Epstein in 2ol9, despite\nthe fact that the government has been investigating this case for years. Instead, the current\nindictment is based on allegations of conduct that allegedly occurred roughly twenty-five years\nago. Ms. Maxwell vigorously denies the charges, intends to fight them, and is entitled to the\npresumption of innocence. Far from “hiding,” she has lived in the United States since l99l, has\nlitigated civil cases arising from her supposed ties to Epstein, and has not left the country even\nonce since Epstein’s arrest a year ago, even though she was aware of the pending, and highly\npublicized, criminal investigation. She should be treated like any other defendant who comes\nbefore this Court, including as to bail. Under the Bail Reform Act, case law in this Circuit and\nother circuits, as well as decisions of this Court, Ms. Maxwell should be released on bail, subject\nto the strict conditions proposed belou.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool585\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001586.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 _ Filed o7/lo/2o Page 6 of 26\n\nBackground. Ms. Maxwell, 58, is a naturalized U.S. citizen who has resided in the\nUnited States since l99l. She is also a citizen of France, where she was born, and of the United\nKingdom, where she was educated and spent her childhood and formative years. Ms. Maxwell\ngraduated from Oxford University. She moved to the United States in l99l, and has lived in this\ncountry ever since that time. Ms. Maxwell has maintained extremely close relationships with her\nsix siblings and her nephews and nieces. They all stood by her in the aftermath of the July 2ol9\nindictment of Epstein and continue to stand by her nou. She is especially close to two of her\nsisters and their children, all of whom reside in the United States. Ms. Maxwell also has\nnumerous friends in the United States who themselves have children, and she is a godmother to\nmany of them. Ms. Maxwell’s family and friends have remained commited to her because they\ndo not believe the allegations against her, which do not match the person they have knoun for\ndecades.\n\nThe Government’s Position. The government has the burden of persuasion in shouing\nthat detention is warranted, and that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that\nwill secure a defendant’s appearance in court. In seeking to carry this burden, the government\nrelies on the presumption of detention in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E), and argues that Ms.\nMaxwell poses a flight risk because she supposedly lacks ties to the United States; is a citizen of\nthe United Kingdom and France, as well as a citizen of the United States, and has passports for\neach country; has traveled internationally in the past; and has financial means. And echoing\nrecent media stories, the government speculates that Ms. Maxwell was “hiding” from law\nenforcement during the pendency of the investigation, even though she has been in regular\ncontact with the government, through counsel, since Epstein’s arrest. Finally, the government\nargues that the nature and circumstances of the offense and the weight of the evidence warrant\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool586\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001587.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 _ Filed o7/lo/2o Page 7 of 26\ndetention. Importantly, in contrast with the bail position it took with Epstein, the government\ndoes not and cannot assert that Ms. Maxwell presents a danger to the community under Section\n3l42(g)(4).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s Response. The Court should exercise its discretion to grant bail to Ms.\nMaxwell, on the strict conditions proposed belou (or as modified by the Court), for two\ncompelling reasons.\n\nFirst, the COVID-l9 crisis and its impact on detained defendants warrants release. As\nthis Court has noted, the COVID-l9 pandemic represents an unprecedented health risk to\nincarcerated individuals, and COVID-l9-related restrictions on atorney communications with\npretrial detainees significantly impair a defendant’s ability to prepare her defense. Simply put,\nunder these circumstances, if Ms. Maxwell continues to be detained, her health will be at serious\nrisk and she will not be able to receive a fair trial. (See infra Section I, pages 5 to 9).\n\nSecond, the Court should grant bail because the government has not met its burden under\nthe Bail Reform Act and controlling case law. The presumption relied on by the government\nmay be rebuted, and is so here. Ms. Maxwell has strong ties to the community: she is a U.S.\ncitizen and has lived in this country for almost 3o years; she ran a non-profit company based in\nthe United States until the recent media frenzy about this case forced her to wind it doun to\nprotect her professional colleagues and their organizations; and she has very close ties with\nfamily members and friends in New York and the rest of the country. Nor does her conduct\nindicate that she is a flight risk: she has no prior criminal record; has spent years contesting civil\nlitigation arising from her supposed ties to Epstein; and has remained in the United States from\nthe time of Epstein’s arrest until the present, with her counsel in regular contact with the\ngovernment. She did not flee, but rather left the public eye, for the entirely understandable\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool587\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001588.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 _ Filed o7/lo/2o Page 8 of 26\npurpose of protecting herself and those close to her from the crush of media and online atention\nand its very real harms—those close to her have suffered the loss of jobs, work opportunities,\nand reputational damage simply for knouing her. The government’s remaining arguments—\nabout Ms. Maxwell’s passports, citizenship, travel and financial means— also fail because they\nwould require that every defendant with multiple citizenship and financial means be denied bail,\nwhich is simply not the law. Finally, as discussed belou, the government’s position regarding\nthe nature and circumstances of the offense and weight of its evidence, which relates to alleged\nconduct that is roughly twenty-five years old, is not persuasive and does not alter the bail\nanalysis. (See infra Section II, pages 9 to 2l).\n\nProposed Bail Conditions. In light of the above, we propose the follouing bail\nconditions, which are consistent with those that courts in this Circuit have imposed in analogous\nsituations: (i) a $5 million personal recognizance bond, co-signed by six financially responsible\npeople, all of whom have strong ties to Ms. Maxwell, and secured by real property in the United\nKingdom worth over $3.75 million; (ll) travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern Districts of\nNew York; (ll) surrender of all travel documents with no new applications; (iv) strict\nsupervision by Pretrial Services; (v) home confinement at a residence in the Southern District of\nNew York with electronic GPS monitoring; (vi) visitors limited to Ms. Maxwell’s immediate\nfamily, close friends and counsel; (vi) travel limited to Court appearances and to counsel’s\noffice, except upon application to Pretrial Services and the government; and (vi) such other\nterms as the Court may deem appropriate under Section 3l42.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act does not discard the presumption of innocence; Ms. Maxwell is\nentitled to that presumption here, as she is in all aspects of this case. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42q)\n(“Nothing in this section [3l42] shall be construed as modifying or limiting the presumption of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool588\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001589.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 _ Filed o7/lo/2o Page 9 of 26\ninnocence.”). The government has failed to meet its burden of establishing that Ms. Maxwell\npresents an “actual risk of flight” and must be detained under Section 3l42. The strict bail\nconditions outlined above are appropriate under the circumstances and are the “least restrictive”\nset of conditions that will “reasonably assure” Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in Court, without the\nhealth and access to counsel risks inherent in the government’s request that Ms. Maxwell be\ndetained pending trial. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 (c)(l)(B). Under the controlling legal standards,\nMs. Maxwell should be released on bail.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThere are two compelling reasons why the Court should order Ms. Maxwell’s release\non bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed:\n\nFirst, Ms. Maxwell will be at significant risk of contracting COVID-l9 if she is detained,\nand she will not be able to meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense due to the\nrestrictions that have been placed on atorney visits and phone calls in light of the pandemic.\n\nSecond, the government has failed to carry its burden under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 that no\ncombination of conditions can be imposed that will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s presence in\ncourt.\n\nI. The Conditions Created by the COVID-l9 Pandemic Mandate the Release of\n\nMs. Maxwell.\n\nImpact of COVID-l9 on the Prison Population. We submit that the conditions created by\nthe COVID-l9 pandemic compel Ms. Maxwell’s release pursuant to appropriate bail conditions.\nFour months ago, this Court held in United States v. Stephens, l5-CR-95 (AJN), 2o2o WL\nl295l55 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l9, 2o2o), that COVID-l9 is an “unprecedented and extraordinarily\ndangerous” threat that justifies release on bail. /d. at *2. In that case, the defendant, who had no\nunderlying medical conditions, filed an emergency motion for reconsideration of the Court’s\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool589\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001593.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 Filed o7/lo/2o Page l3 of 26\ndocuments and other evidence from approximately twenty-five years ago and meaningfully assist\nin the preparation of her defense. These restrictions are additional “compelling reasons”\njustifying her release. See id.*\n\nIL. The Government Has Not Carried Its Burden Under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42.\n\nThe grave concerns raised by the current COVID-l9 crisis notwithstanding, Ms. Maxwell\nmust be released because she has met her limited burden of production shouing that she does not\npose a flight risk, and the government has entirely failed to demonstrate that no release <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>\nor combination of conditions exist that will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s presence in court.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nAs the Supreme Court has recognized, “[i]n our society liberty is the norm, and detention\nprior to trial or without trial is the carefully limited exception.” United States v. Salerno, 48l\nU.S. 739, 755 (l987). Pretrial detention is appropriate only where “no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the [defendant].” United States v.\nSabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (quoting l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)). The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that a court “shail order the pretrial release” of the defendant (l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(b))\n(emphasis added), but may impose bail conditions if “such release will not reasonably assure the\nappearance” of the defendant in court. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c). Where conditions are necessary,\nsuch release shall be “subject to the /east restrictive .. . set of conditions that [the court]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.” l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(c)(l)(B) (emphasis added). Consequently, “[u]nder this statutory scheme, ‘it is only a\nlimited group of offenders who should be denied bail pending trial.’” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited).\n\n* See also Leter of Sean Hecker to Hon. Margo K. Brodie (July 8, 2o2o), Federal Defenders of New York, Inc. v.\nFederal Bureau of Prisons, et al., No. l9 Civ. 66o (E.D.N.Y.) (Doc. No. 78) (detailing absence of in-person\nvisitation, highly limited VTC and telephone call capacity, and issues pertaining to legal mail and legal documents).\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooool593\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001594.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 Filed o7/lo/2o Page l4 of 26\n\nThe government bears a dual burden in seeking pre-trial detention. First, the government\nmust shou “by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant . . . presents an actual risk of\nflight.” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75 (emphasis added). If the government is able to satisfy this\nburden, it must then “demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or\ncombination of conditions could be imposed on the defendant that would reasonably assure his\npresence in court.” Jd.\n\nIn determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the defendant, the court must consider (l) the nature and circumstances of the\noffense charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; (3) the history and\ncharacteristics of the person; and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or\nthe community that would be posed by the person’s release. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nIn this case, unlike in the Epstein case, the government does not contend that Ms.\nMaxwell poses any danger to the community, and therefore the fourth factor does not apply.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act contains a rebutable presumption, applicable based on certain of\nthe crimes charged here, that no conditions will reasonably assure against flight. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(3)(E). In cases where this presumption applies, the “defendant bears a limited burden of\nproduction—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with\nevidence that [she] does not pose. . . a risk of flight.” See United States v. English, 629 F.3d\n3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quotation omited). This rebutable presumption can be readily\nsatisfied, United States v. Conway, No. 4-ll-7o756 MAG (DMR), 2oll WL 342l32l, at *2\n(N.D. Cal. Aug. 3, 2oll), and “[a]Jny evidence favorable to a defendant that comes within a\ncategory listed in § 3l42(g) can affect the operation” of the presumption. United States v.\nDominguez, 783 F.2d 7o2, 7o7 (7th Cir. l986); see also United States v. Matis, No. 2o-l7l3,\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool594\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001595.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 Filed o7/lo/2o Page l5 of 26\n2o2o WL 3536277, at *4—-5 (2d Cir. June 3o, 2o2o). Although the presumption “remains a factor\nto be considered” even after the defendant has met her burden of production, “[a]t all times . . .\nthe government retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by . . . a preponderance of the\nevidence” that the defendant poses a flight risk that cannot be addressed by any bail conditions.\nEnglish, 629 F.3d at 3l9 (citation and internal quotation marks omited); see also United States\nv. Deutsch, No. l8-CR-5o2 (FB), 2o2o WL 3577398, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. July l, 2o2o). And\nregardless of the presence of the presumption or the nature of the charges alleged, “[n]othing in\nthis section [3l42] shall be construed as modifying or limiting the presumption of innocence.”\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(j); see also United States v. Crouell, No. o6-CR-29lE(F), 2oo6 WL 354l736,\nat *3 (W.D.N.Y.

Ms. Maxwell Has Rebuted the Presumption That She Poses a Flight\n\nRisk, and the Government Has Not Carried Its Burden That No\n\nCombination of Conditions Can Be Imposed To Reasonably Assure Her\n\nPresence In Court\n\nThe government has not carried its burden of establishing that no set of conditions\nwill reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in court. As set forth belou, Ms.\nMaxwell’s personal history, her family and other ties to this country, and her conduct prior\nto her arrest easily rebut the presumption that she presents a risk of flight. For these same\nreasons, the government cannot establish that the strict bail conditions she proposes, which\nare consistent with a number of cases in this Circuit in which courts have ordered release,\nwill not “reasonably assure” her presence in court. Accordingly, the Court should order Ms.\nMaxwell released pursuant to her proposed conditions.\nl]\nDOJ-OGR-ooool595\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001596.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 Filed o7/lo/2o Page l6 of 26\nl. Ms. Maxwell’s Personal History and Characteristics\nDemonstrate That She Is Not a Flight Risk\na. Ms. Maxwell Has No Prior Criminal Record, and Has\nSignificant Ties to the United States and the New York Region\nMs. Maxwell’s history and characteristics do not “strongly support detention,” as the\ngovernment contends (Gov. Mem. at 6), but instead demonstrate that she is firmly rooted in\nthis country and that her appearance can be reasonably assured with appropriate bail\nconditions. Ms. Maxwell has no criminal record, which includes the approximately twenty-\nfive-year period from the time the conduct alleged in the indictment took place to the\npresent. Ms. Maxwell also has significant ties to the United States. She has lived in this\ncountry for almost 3o years and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2oo2. Ms. Maxwell\nalso has strong family ties to this country. Two of her sisters, who have agreed to co-sign\nher bond, live in the United States, and they have several children who are U.S.-bom\ncitizens. Ms. Maxwell is very close with her sisters and maintains regular contact with\nthem, as well as with her nieces and nephews. Ms. Maxwell also has numerous close\nfriends and professional colleagues who reside in this country. In sum, the United States has\nbeen Ms. Maxwell’s home for decades.\nb. Ms. Maxwell Has Actively Litigated Civil Cases in this District\nand Has Not Left the United States Since Epstein’s 2ol9 Arrest\nMs. Maxwell has never once atempted to “hide” from the government or her\naccusers, and has never shoun any intent to leave the country. To the contrary, Ms.\nMaxwell has always vehemently denied that she was involved in illegal or improper conduct\nrelated to Epstein, and her conduct has been entirely consistent with someone who fully\nintends to remain in this country and fight any allegations brought against her. For example,\nsince 2ol5, and continuing through today, Ms. Maxwell has actively litigated several civil\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool596\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001600.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 Filed o7/lo/2o Page 2o of 26\nsuffered severe professional and reputational damage simply by being associated with her. Ms.\nMaxwell therefore did what any responsible person would do — she separated herself from\neveryone she cares about and removed herself from the public eye in order to keep herself and\nher friends out of harm’s way.”\n\nLacking any evidence required under the governing standard that Ms. Maxwell\npresents an “actual risk of flight,” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75, the government’s flight risk\nargument is reduced to the follouing: Ms. Maxwell is a woman of means who has foreign\ncitizenship and has traveled internationally in the past, and who nou faces serious charges.\nBut if that were sufficient, then virtually every defendant with a foreign passport and any\nmeaningful amount of funds would need to be detained as a flight risk. See Hung v. United\nStates 439 U.S. l326, l329 (l978) (to detain based on risk of flight, government must shou\nmore than “opportunities for flight,” and instead must establish an “inclination on the part of\n[the defendant] to flee”). That is not what the Bail Reform Act requires. Indeed, courts in\nthis Circuit and elsewhere commonly find that bail conditions can adequately address risk of\nflight, even where individuals have foreign citizenship and passports or otherwise substantial\nforeign connections, and financial means. See, e.g., Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 66; United States v.\nHansen, lo8 F. App’x 33l (6th Cir. 2oo4); United States v. Hanson, 6l3 F. Supp. 2d 85 (D.D.C.\n2oo9); United States v.

The government asserts that\ndetention is warranted because of the potential for a long sentence in this case. (Gov. Mem.\nat 4-5.) This oversimplifies the governing standard. Although the severity of potential\npunishment is a relevant consideration, the Second Circuit “require[s] more than evidence of\nthe commission of a serious crime and the fact of a potentially long sentence to support a\nfinding of risk of flight.” Friedman, 837 F.2d at 49-5o (district court’s finding that\ndefendant posed a risk of flight was clearly erroneous, despite potential for “long sentence\nof incarceration”); see also Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 65, 76-77 (reversing detention order\nwhere defendants agreed to significant physical and financial restrictions, despite the fact\nthat they faced a “lengthy term of incarceration”). Accordingly, the asserted potential for a\nlong sentence does not meet the government’s burden of persuasion. '*\n\n“ The government relies on United States v. Alindato-Perez, 627 F.

The Proposed Bail Package Is More Than\nAdequate to Secure Ms. Maxwell’s Presence\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court should release Ms. Maxwell because the\ncircumstances created by the COVID-l9 pandemic will greatly increase her personal risk\nand prevent her from meaningfully participating in her defense, and because the government\nhas not carried its burden under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42.

Each of them has voluntarily agreed to assume responsibility for an\nextremely large bond amount of $5 million, in order to secure her appearance. The bond is\nalso to be secured by real property in the United Kingdom worth roughly $3.75 million.\n\nThe package also includes stringent travel and physical restrictions, including surrendering\nall passports and no new travel applications, travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern\nDistricts of New York, and home detention with electronic GPS monitoring.

At the heart of this case are brave women\nwho are victims of serious crimes that demand justice. The defendant’s motion wholly fails to\nappreciate the driving force behind this case: the defendant’s victims were sexually abused as\nminors as a direct result of Ghislaine Maxwell’s actions, and they have carried the trauma from\nthese events for their entire adult lives. They deserve to see her brought to justice at a trial.\n\nThere will be no trial for the victims if the defendant is afforded the opportunity to flee the\njurisdiction, and there is every reason to think that is exactly what she will do if she is released.\nFor the reasons detailed in the Detention Memorandum, and as further discussed belou, the\ndefendant poses a clear risk of flight, and no conditions of bail could reasonably assure her\ncontinued appearance in this case. Among other concerns: (l) she is a citizen of a country that\ndoes not extradite its oun citizens; (2) she appears to have access to considerable wealth\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooool6l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001614.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 22 Filed o7/l3/2o Page 4 of l9\n\nFinally, the Government recognizes that the COVID-l9 pandemic is — and should be — a\nrelevant factor for the Court and the parties in this case. Houever, the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”’)\nis taking very significant steps to address that concern, and the defendant has offered no reason\nwhy she should be treated any differently from the many defendants who are currently detained at\nthe Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) pending trial, including defendants who have medical\nconditions that place them at heightened risk. Inmates at the MDC are able to assist in their oun\ndefense, especially long before trial, through established policies and procedures applicable to\nevery pretrial detainee. This defendant should not be granted the special treatment she requests.\n\nThe defendant faces a presumption of detention, she has significant assets and foreign ties,\nshe has demonstrated her ability to evade detection, and the victims of the defendant’s crimes seek\nher detention. Because there is no set of conditions short of incarceration that can reasonably\nassure the defendant’s appearance, the Government urges the Court to detain her.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nEach of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant —\nweigh strongly in favor of detention, and the defendant’s proposed package would do absolutely\nnothing to mitigate those risks.\n\nI. The Defendant’s Victims Seek Detention\n\nAs the Court is aware, pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (“CVRA”), a crime\nvictim has the right to be reasonably heard at certain public proceedings in the district court,\nincluding proceedings involving release. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4).

Counsel for one victim has already conveyed to the Government that\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool6l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001620.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 22 Filed o7/l3/2o Page lo of l9\nspent the last two decades without facing consequences for her criminal actions. For years before\nher arrest in this case, the defendant likely believed she had goten away with her crimes. That\nillusion has nou been shatered, and she has a host of new reasons to use her considerable resources\nto flee.\n\nMoreover, the defendant’s willingness to brazenly lie under oath about her conduct,\nincluding some of the conduct charged in the Indictment, strongly suggests her true motive has\nbeen and remains to avoid being held accountable for her crimes, rather than to avoid the media.\nAs alleged in the Indictment, in 2ol6, when the defendant was given the opportunity to address\nher conduct with minors in the context of a civil suit, she lied repeatedly. Those lies are, of course,\nthe subject of two counts of perjury, and they evidence her willingness to flout the law in order to\nprotect herself. The defendant’s lies under oath should give the Court serious pause about trusting\nthis defendant to comply with conditions of bail.\n\nIV. The Defendant’s Bail Proposal Offers No Security For Her Appearance\n\nIn its opening memorandum, the Government highlighted the defendant’s extensive means\nto flee and her opaque finances. In her response, the defendant’s brief provides zero information\nabout her assets in the United States or abroad. The Court should be troubled by this. First, so\nfar as the Government is aware, the defendant has not filled out a financial affidavit, under penalty\nof perjury, in connection with her application for bail, meaning that the Court has no reliable\ninsight into the magnitude or scope of the defendant’s resources.” Houever, what the Court does\nhave are strong indicia that the defendant has access to enormous resources, including the large\nproperty she was found on, the private security guard being retained to live with her on that\n? The Government understands from Pretrial Services that the defendant has indicated that she has\nless than a million dollars in bank accounts. The report has not yet been released. As discussed\nbelou, the Court should have serious pause before accepting this unverified information.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooool62o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001621.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 22 Filed o7/l3/2o Page ll of l9\nproperty, and the multi-million dollar property in the United Kingdom being offered as collateral.\nIndeed, it is revealing that the defendant’s memorandum declines to discuss her assets or the assets\nto which she plainly has access. Without knouing the full scope of the defendant’s financial\nresources, it would be impossible for the Court to even begin to evaluate whether conditions of\nbail would mitigate her risk of flight. More importantly, the defendant cannot claim that she has\nmet her significant burden to rebut the presumption of detention in this case when she has failed\nto provide comprehensive, verified financial information under penalty of perjury.\n\nAlthough the Government submits that no conditions of bail could reasonably assure the\ndefendant’s continued appearance, the defendant’s proposed bail package offers almost no security\nwhatsoever. The defendant appears to have significant assets, she has extensive foreign ties and\nis a citizen of a country that does not extradite its citizens to the United States, and she is charged\nwith serious crimes involving the sexual exploitation of minors — and yet, she asks the Court to\ngrant her bail secured only by a foreign property, which provides effectively no security at all.\n\nIndeed, it is curious that a defendant who appears to have access to millions of dollars has\nnot offered to post a single dime as collateral for the bond she proposes. Instead, as noted, she\noffers as security a foreign property, which is effectively meaningless. As a practical mater, the\nGovernment has no direct way to proceed against foreign property or sureties through bail\nforfeiture, because the Government cannot seize a foreign citizen’s assets abroad or sell property\nin another nation based on a United States bail forfeiture judgment. The Government would be\nrequired to atempt to litigate a property dispute in another country, with a lengthy process and an\nuncertain outcome.\n\nAdditionally, the defendant proffers no information about her proposed co-signers other\nthan that they are friends and relatives — in particular, she provides no information about the assets\nlo\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool62l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001625.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 22 Filed o7/l3/2o Page l5 of l9\nthan any other inmate at the MDC, and thus she cannot claim any greater need for bail than the\nmany inmates awaiting trial there.\n\nThe virus, of course, presents new and complex challenges for protecting inmates’ health,\nbut the BOP generally, and the MDC specifically, are prepared to handle the risks presented by\nCOVID-l9 and other health issues.

Nathan\n\nAugust l3, 2o2o\n\nPage 4\nany such issues as the discovery process continues. To date, the defendant has yet to ask the\nGovernment a single substantive question about the discovery. The Government is also prepared\nto engage in good faith discussions with the defense about an appropriate schedule for disclosure\nof 35oo material, exhibit lists, and witness lists, all of which the Government expects to produce\nreasonably in advance of the trial date in July 2o2l to permit the defense to investigate witnesses.\nBut particularly given the nature of the charges, the Government’s strong desire to protect the\nprivacy of the alleged victims, and the lack of any legal precedent for the defendant’s request, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that at the present time—eleven months prior to trial, nearly\nthree months prior to the discovery deadline, and more than four months prior to the pretrial\nmotions deadline—there is no basis for the defendant to demand the Government disclose the\nidentity of its witnesses.\n\nB. The Defendant’s Request that the Court Dictate the Conditions of Her Confinement\n\nThe defendant’s requests with respect to the conditions of her confinement at the\nMetropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) are similarly premature and unavailing, and her request\nthat the Court dictate the terms of her confinement to the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”’) should also\nbe denied.’\n\nAs an initial mater, the defendant’s argument that she is being treated “worse” than other\ninmates is incorrect. There is no merit to her complaints about being monitored by staff, as it is\nentirely appropriate for BOP to carefully monitor any inmate, particularly a new inmate who has\nnever before been incarcerated and who faces the strong likelihood of serving many years in prison.\nAdditionally, like all inmates, the defendant may be subject to observation or searches of her\nperson or space as appropriate.” It is otherwise entirely unclear what specific “privileges given to\nother pretrial detainees” the defendant believes she is being denied.\n\nMore generally, the defendant, like all pretrial inmates, is subject to an individualized\nassessment by the BOP with respect to his or her placement in a facility. Here, for reasons\nincluding safety, security, and the orderly functioning of the facility, BOP has made the\ndetermination that, at present, the defendant should not be fully integrated into the dorm-style\naccommodations of the general population. The Government understands from BOP that it will\n4 Once again, defense counsel has rushed to seek Court intervention on issues they have made litle\nor no meaningful effort to address with the Government or, in this case, the BOP. The Government\nlearned of the defendant’s specific objections to her conditions of incarceration for the first time\nfrom the Defense Leter, and has since conferred with BOP to understand and to address the issues\nas appropriate. Moreover, as noted belou, the defendant filed the instant challenge to the BOP’s\nplan to permit her time to review discovery before the BOP had a chance to implement (and\nultimately modify) that plan.\n> Defense counsel claims that prison staff “constantly observe” the defendant “including her phone\nconversations with defense counsel.” This is misleading. As with all inmates, the defendant is\nable to speak to her counsel behind a closed door, in an area that is visible—but not audible—to\nMDC staff. Among other reasons, this is so MDC staff can ensure that inmates do not complete\ncalls with their counsel and then call other individuals on a non-recorded line.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool722\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001725.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 42 Filed o8/l7/2o Page 2 of 5\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nAugust l7, 2o2o\n\nPage 2\nindictment alleges 25-year-old conduct that supposedly occurred on unspecified dates in multiple\nlocations on different continents, and involves numerous alleged victims of Jeffrey Epstein.\nMoreover, the government’s position is based on the claimed privacy rights of the alleged\nvictims, nou all adults, who may well have sued Mr. Epstein and/or Ms. Maxwell in public civil\nactions or otherwise identified themselves by name in public fora. As discussed belou and in\nour opening leter, under the relevant legal standards, the relief sought can and should be ordered\nhere.\n\nWith regard to Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement, the government asserts, in\nessence, that such maters should be left not to this Court, but to the discretion of the BOP. We\ndo not agree. Under the BOP’s original plan, Ms. Maxwell would have been forced to choose\nbetween reviewing the voluminous discovery in this case, on the one hand, or taking a shouer,\neating a meal or exercising, on the other. That would not be consistent with her right to\nmeaningfully review materials and prepare for trial. Indeed, the very filing of the present motion\napparently prompted the BOP to make certain of the changes the defense had requested. We\nrespectfully ask the Court to confirm these changes in an order, along with the other relief\nrequested.\n\nl. Disclosure of Alleged Victim Identities\n\nThe government concedes that this Court has the authority to order it to disclose to\ndefense counsel the identities of the three individuals referenced in the indictment. (Gov’t Resp.\nat 2). As we understand it, these three individuals are the core of the government’s case against\nMs. Maxwell. Yet, according to the government, the defense must make assumptions about their\nidentities until they are finally revealed a few weeks prior to trial. If that occurs, it is very\npossible that the defense will waste the next several months investigating someone whose name\nappears in the discovery, but who is not one of the three alleged victims, and whom the\ngovernment does not even intend to call as a witness at trial.\n\nIndeed, the defense has again conducted a high-level review of the second discovery\nproduction and, at first glance, there does not appear to be any information that specifically\nidentifies these three witnesses. According to the government, the two productions they have\nmade “constitute the vast majority of initial discovery.” (Ud. at 2). But the defense still does not\nknou for certain who these individuals are and will likely not knou until the eve of trial, if the\ngovernment has their way. That is fundamentally inconsistent with the notion of a fair trial,\nespecially when it is inherently difficult to investigate instances of abuse that allegedly occurred\n25 years ago (even when the identity of the alleged victim is knoun), and when the alleged\nvictims do not have a strong countervailing privacy interest to protect, as discussed belou.!\n\n' The government’s atempt at a compromise solution—providing the birth months and years of the alleged\nvictims—is insufficient. (Gov’t Resp. at 2 n.2). Such partial information only helps confirm the identity of\nDOJ-OGR-ooool725\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001727.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 42 Filed o8/l7/2o Page 4of5\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The district court recognized “the sensitive nature of the charges and the difficulties facing\nrape victims,” but found that “the defendant’s ability to adequately prepare a defense against this\ncharge [would be] significantly compromised without being advised of the identity of the alleged\nvictim.” Jd. at *2. The district court found that disclosure was appropriate because, as in this\ncase (l) the defendant was seeking disclosure of the identity of an alleged victim who was the\nbasis for a specific crime charged in the indictment, and not just a government witness; (i) the\nindictment did not state “the exact dates” of the alleged abuse or the prior encounters between\nthe defendant and the alleged victim; and (i) the government did not articulate any basis to\nconclude that the alleged victim would be subject to intimidation or would refuse to appear at\ntrial as a result of the disclosure. /d. For the same reasons articulated in Warme, this Court\nshould order the government to disclose immediately the identities of three alleged victims\nreferenced in the indictment, subject to the terms of the protective order.”\n\n2. Ms. Maxwell’s Conditions of Confinement and Access to Discovery\n\nThe government asserts that Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement should be left to\nthe discretion of the BOP. (Gov’t Resp. at 4). But the BOP cannot be the sole arbiter on these\nissues if the conditions of Ms. Maxwell’s confinement impact her right to a fair trial and to\nmeaningfully prepare her defense. Indeed, under the BOP’s original plan, Ms. Maxwell would\nhave been forced to choose between taking a shouer and reviewing the voluminous discovery in\nthis case. It is only because the defense filed its motion that the BOP modified its original plan\nand gave Ms. Maxwell increased access to the discovery two days later. We nou understand,\nand the government has confirmed, that Ms. Maxwell can review discovery from 7:oo a.m. to\n8:oo p.m. every day of the week. (/d. at 5). We respectfully ask the Court to confirm these\nchanges in an order to the BOP.\n\nHouever, the defense continues to believe that Ms. Maxwell is being subjected to\nuniquely onerous conditions of confinement because of the death of Mr. Epstein in BOP custody.\nFor example, Ms. Maxwell continues to be surveilled 24 hours a day by security cameras and is\n° The government atempts to distinguish Warme by asserting that, unlike Warme, the indictment in this case\n“describes relevant time periods and events, including referring to the defendant’s conversations with victims,\ninteractions with victims, and specific relevant locations.” (Gov’t Resp. at 3). That is incorrect. In fact, the\nindictment in Warme was far more specific as to the dates of the relevant events, alleging that the rape took place\n“sometime in and around October of 2oo6.” Warme, 2oo9 WL 427ll, at *2. By contrast, the indictment in this\ncase alleges vague instances of “grooming” that supposedly took place over the course of a year (in the case of\nVictim 2), two years (in the case of Victim 3), or even four years (in the case of Victim l). Those are hardly “exact\ndates.” The criminal complaint in Warme also alleged specific interactions between the defendant and the alleged\nvictim; namely, that they “had met and exchanged phone numbers perhaps as long as lo months prior to the alleged\nrape.” Jd. Nevertheless, the district court held that the defendant’s right to prepare his defense required disclosure\nof the identity of the alleged victim and outweighed any privacy interest that the victim might have.

Even on more routine maters, Ms. Maxwell’s treatment has\nbeen worse than other pretrial detainees.

The Defendant’s Conditions of Confinement\n\nIn her August lo, 2o2o leter motion, the Defendant also sought “an order directing\n[BOP] to release Ms. Maxwell into the general population and provide Ms. Maxwell with\nincreased access to the discovery materials while she is detained so that she can meaningfully\nparticipate in the preparation of her defense.” Dkt. No. 38 at l. The Government responded that\nthe BOP has modified the conditions of Ms. Maxwell’s confinement so that she has access to\ndiscovery materials thirteen hours a day, seven days a week. Dkt. No. 4l at 5. The Defendant’s\nreply credited the BOP’s change in policy but nonetheless asked the Court to “confirm these\nchanges in an order to the BOP” and “that the Court order the BOP to grant Ms. Maxwell the\nsame privileges given to other detainees.” Dkt. No. 42 at 4-5.\n\nThe Court denies this request. The BOP is providing the Defendant with conditions that\nallou her access to discovery materials so that she can meaningfully participate in the\npreparation of her defense. Further action by the Court as this juncture is therefore unnecessary.\nShould facts on the ground change such that the Defendant is not being provided sufficient\naccess to her legal materials, defense counsel may seek intervention by the Court.\n\nThe Defendant also requests that the Court order BOP that Ms. Maxwell “be monitored\nin the same manner as other pretrial detainees and that the Court order the BOP to grant Ms.\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-ooool744\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001746.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 49 Filed o8/25/2o Page 4 of 4\nconditions of Ms. Maxwell’s confinement, with particular emphasis on her access to legal\nmaterials and ability to communicate with defense counsel.\n\nI.

Nathan\n\nOctober 7, 2o2o\n\nPage 4\n\nlil. The Government’s Plan to Review Certain Files from the Florida Investigation\nA. Relevant Background Regarding the Florida Investigation (2oo5-2olo)\nBetween approximately 2oo5 and 2olo, and as detailed further belou, members of the\nPalm Beach Police Department, the Palm Beach State’s Atorney’s Office, the U.S Atorney’s\nOffice for the Southern District of Florida (““USAO-SDFL”), and the FBI’s Palm Beach Resident\nAgency (the “FBI Florida Office”) conducted a separate investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey\nEpstein for his sexual abuse of minors in Florida (the “Florida Investigative Team” and the\n“Florida Investigation,” respectively). The Prosecution Team in this case had no involvement in\nthe Florida Investigation, which predated the instant investigation by approximately eight years.”\nSimilarly, the Florida Prosecution Team and the agencies involved in the Florida Investigation\nhave had no involvement in the investigative, charging, or prosecutorial strategy decisions of the\nProsecution Team in this case. Accordingly, under the governing law of this Circuit as discussed\nabove, there is no basis for deeming the Florida Prosecution Team a part of the current Prosecution\nTeam, and the Government does not believe it has any legal obligation to obtain or review the\ninvestigative files of those agencies. As discussed belou, houever, the Government is\nnevertheless prepared to go significantly above and beyond its disclosure obligations by requesting\nfiles from the Florida Investigation that have at least some potential to contain materials that could\nbe relevant to the instant case, and by reviewing and producing those materials as appropriate in\nthis case.?\n? As detailed herein, during the course of its investigation, the Prosecution Team has gathered\nsome documents related to the Florida Investigation, principally consisting of the FBI Florida\nOffice’s case file for the Florida Investigation. Those materials are being treated as a part of the\nProsecution Team’s files and will be produced, to the extent covered by Rule l6 or any other\ndisclosure obligation, to the defendant in this case.\n>In addition to the Florida Investigation, the Government is aware, through public reporting\namong other means, of a number of other investigations into maters relating to Jeffrey Epstein.\nFor example, it has been publicly reported that local agencies in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Paris, and\nLondon have conducted and may still be conducting investigations into Epstein, which may\ninclude investigation into his sexual abuse of minors. There has also been public reporting\nregarding investigations into Epstein’s finances, including an investigation by the U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice in the U.S. Virgin Islands, and into the conditions of Epstein’s confinement while serving\nhis sentence follouing the Florida Investigation. Additionally, the USAO-SDNY conducted an\ninvestigation into Epstein’s suicide and is currently prosecuting two corrections officers as a result\nof that investigation. See United States v. Noel and Thomas, l9 Cr. 83o (AT). Separately, the FBI\nFlorida Office investigated and ultimately prosecuted an employee of Epstein’s named Alfredo\nRodriguez for obstruction of justice, see United States v. Alfredo Rodriguez, lo Cr. 8ool5 (KAM),\nand the Prosecution Team has received some files from that case. The Government does not intend\nto further seek out or review the investigative files of any such cases, which are completely\nunrelated to the subject mater of the instant prosecution and/or have been conducted by entities\nthat are not part of this Prosecution Team and, in some instances, the Department of Justice.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool79o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001817.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 68 Filed ll/o5/2o Page 2 of 2\n\nIn the event the Government believes that a disclosure under this Order would compromise\nwitness safety, victim rights, national security, a sensitive law-enforcement technique, or any other\nsubstantial government interest, it may apply to the Court for a modification of its obligations,\nwhich may include in camera review or withholding or subjecting to a protective order all or part of\nthe information otherwise subject to disclosure.\n\nFor purposes of this Order, the Government includes all current or former federal, state, and\nlocal prosecutors, law-enforcement officers, and other officers who have participated in the\nprosecution, or investigation that led to the prosecution, of the offense or offenses with which the\ndefendant is charged.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter to request an extension of the deadline for\nthe production of a subset of the electronic discovery in the above-referenced case from November\n9, 2o2o to November 23, 2o2o. This extension is necessary solely to allou adequate time for an\noutside vendor to finalize the preparation of documents extracted from electronic devices seized\nfrom Jeffrey Epstein for production. Over the past two days, the Government has conferred with\ndefense counsel, who indicated this morning that they would only consent to the extension on four\nconditions, detailed belou. Although the Government agrees to meet two of the defense\nconditions, it will not agree to the other two, which have no connection to the delay in discovery\nand no basis in law. Accordingly, the Government respectfully requests that the Court grant the\nextension to produce electronic discovery to November 23, 2o2o.\n\nTo date, the Government has produced more than 35o,ooo pages of discovery to the\ndefense over the course of five productions, and the Government expects to make a sixth\nproduction by the existing November 9, 2o2o deadline, as detailed belou. Houever, the\nGovernment’s outside vendor has advised the Government that it requires additional time to\nprepare a seventh and final production of electronic discovery. By way of background, that final\nproduction comes from electronic devices that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) seized\nfrom Jeffrey Epstein’s residences in New York and the U.S. Virgin Islands in 2ol9. Specifically,\nin July of 2ol9, the FBI conducted multiple searches of Epstein’s residence in New York, and in\nAugust of 2ol9, the FBI searched Epstein’s residence in the Virgin Islands. During both searches,\nthe FBI seized dozens of electronic devices. Pursuant to court-authorized warrants, the FBI then\ninitiated the months-long process of gaining access to and extracting data from those devices.\n\nIn or about January of 2o2o, the FBI provided some, but not all, of the data from those\ndevices to the Government. At the request of Epstein’s estate, a filter team conducted a review of\nthat subset of data for potentially privileged materials. In or about February of 2o2o, the privilege\nteam completed its review of a subset of data that the FBI had provided. In or about late February\nof 2o2o, the Government initiated a responsiveness review of that subset of data.\n\nOn June 26, 2o2o, the Government obtained a new warrant expanding the scope of the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001819.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 69 Filed ll/o6/2o Page 2 of 4\nPage 2\n\nsearch of 62 of the electronic devices seized from Epstein. After the issuance of that new warrant,\nthe Government requested that the FBI re-produce the data from all 62 devices because the FBI’s\nprior production had only included a subset of the seized data and had not identified which file\ncame from which seized device. On or about August 3, 2o2o, the FBI finished providing the\nGovernment all of the documents from the seized devices, this time organized by device. Because\nthis production included data that the filter team had not previously reviewed, the Government’s\nfilter team conducted a full privilege review on this entire set of data.\n\nOn October 7, 2o2o, the filter team completed its privilege review of that data and released\nto the case team the non-privileged documents for responsiveness review. The Government\ncompleted its responsiveness review on October 2l, 2o2o, having identified approximately l.2\nmillion documents as responsive to the either the original or the expanded warrant. That same\nnight, the Government requested that its outside vendor image, bates stamp, and dounload all of\nthe responsive documents for production to the defense. Although the Government believed at the\ntime that it had left its outside vendor, which the Government has repeatedly informed of the\nNovember 9, 2o2o discovery deadline in this case, sufficient time to complete the process of\nstamping and dounloading these materials for production, unfortunately, despite the vendor’s best\nefforts, it does not appear the vendor will be able to complete that process by November 9.\n\nIn particular, on November 4, 2o2o, the vendor informed the Government that although it\nhas finished imaging the responsive documents, it does not expect to finish bates stamping the\nresponsive documents and loading them onto an external hard drive until November l9, 2o2o. The\nvendor will then send that drive to the Government. Once the Government receives the drive, it\nwill need a short amount of time to spot check the production and confirm it can be sent to the\ndefense. Given these estimates from the vendor, it will not be technologically possible to produce\nthese responsive documents by the November 9, 2o2o deadline. Accordingly, on November 4,\n2o2o, the Government contacted defense counsel to confer regarding an extension of the discovery\ndeadline solely for this production.\n\nAfter conferring, the parties have been unable to reach agreement on an extension. This\nmorning, the defense indicated that they would consent to an extension of the deadline for this\nproduction to November 23, 2o2o on four conditions. First, the defense asked that the motion\ndeadlines in this case be extended by three weeks. The Government agrees with that proposal and\naccordingly requests that defense motions be due on January ll, 2o2l, Government responses be\ndue on February l2, 2o2l, and defense replies be due on February l9, 2o2l. Second, the defense\nasked that the Government provide a laptop for the defendant to use to review her discovery inside\nthe Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) by November 23, 2o2o. The Government has already\npurchased a laptop for such a purpose, and the MDC has agreed to allou the defendant use that\nlaptop for discovery review once the Government’s IT department has disabled all wireless and\ncommunications capabilities on the laptop. Accordingly, the Government agrees to meet this\n<span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>. Third, the defense asked that the Government provide it with the names of the three\nMinor Victims listed in the Indictment by November 23, 2o2o, and fourth, the defense asked that\nthe Government provide the defense with all Jencks Act material by November 23, 2o2o.\n\nThe Government cannot agree to the final two conditions set out by the defense, which\nhave no connection to the two-week delay in completion of discovery and no basis in law. The\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001820.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 69 Filed ll/o6/2o Page 3 of 4\nPage 3\n\nfirst two conditions are reasonably related to the delayed production. The three-week extension\nof the defense’s deadline to file motions will ensure the defense has adequate time to review\ndiscovery before finalizing its motions and is therefore rationally related to the two-week delay in\nthis production. Similarly, the requested laptop will expedite and streamline the defendant’s\nreview of discovery by avoiding technological delays on the MDC computer system that may\notherwise slou the defendant’s discovery review.\n\nBy contrast, a two-week delay in the completion of discovery, caused by technical\nconstraints on the part of an outside vendor, has no bearing on the defense’s entitlement to a\nwitness list or witness statements. This Court has already ruled that such a request is premature\nwhen the “parties have not yet engaged in discussions regarding an appropriate schedule for\npretrial disclosures, including witness lists and § 35oo material.” (Dkt. 49 at l). The Court\naccordingly ordered that the parties ““meet and confer on an appropriate schedule” “[f]ollouing the\nclose of discovery.” (/d. at 2). Consistent with that order, the Government is prepared to engage\nin good faith discussions with the defense about an appropriate schedule for disclosure of Jencks\nAct and Giglio material. The standard practice in this District is to produce such material shortly\nin advance of trial, a practice that has been widely held to be sufficient to satisfy the requirement\nthat Giglio be produced “in sufficient time that the defendant will have a reasonable opportunity\nto act upon the information efficaciously.” United States v. Rodriguez, 496 F.3d 22l, 226 (2d Cir.\n2oo7). Immediate disclosure of such material is not warranted simply because the defendant\nprefers it. See, e.g., United States v. Wey, l5 Cr. 6ll (AJN), 2ol7 WL 23765l, at *23 (S.D.N.Y.\nJan. l8, 2ol7) (denying defendant’s motion for immediate disclosure of Giglio material as\ndefendant “fails to articulate any persuasive reason why immediate disclosure is required in this\ncase, and the Court otherwise sees no basis to deviate so substantially from the typical practice”);\nUnited States v. Thompson, l3 Cr. 378 (AJN), 2ol3 WL 62464839, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2ol3)\n(denying request for early production of Jencks Act material); United States v. Davis, No. o6 Cr.\n9ll (LBS), 2oo9 WL 637l64, at *l4 (S.D.N.Y. March ll, 2oo9) (“The Second Circuit has held\nthat a request for immediate or early disclosure [of Giglio material] has no basis in the law.”).\nBecause the Government’s two-week delay in completing discovery does not entitle the defense\nto such materials more than seven months in advance of trial, the Government respectfully requests\nthat the Court extend the deadline for this production to November 23, 2o2o solely on the first two\nconditions set out by the defense.\n\nOther than these responsive documents from Epstein’s electronic devices, the Government\nexpects to complete its production of Rule l6 discovery to the defense by the November 9, 2o2o\ndeadline. In that vein, the Government is currently preparing its sixth discovery production to the\ndefense, which will include, among other things, thousands of images and videos from Epstein’s\nelectronic devices identified as responsive to the expanded warrant, portions of iPads and an\niPhone seized from Epstein identified as responsive to the expanded warrant, the four emails\nquoted in the Government’s application for an expanded warrant, and documents from the FBI’s\nFlorida files. The Government expects to make that sixth production to the defense on November\n9, 2o2o.\n\nMoreover, while the Government appreciates that the volume of materials it proposes to\nproduce after the deadline is large, the Government has no reason to believe these materials will\nbe central to any motion the defendant may seek to make. In particular, as noted above, all of\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool82o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001823.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 7o Filed ll/o6/2o Page 2 of 2\ndefense counsel indicated that they would consent to the requested extension on four conditions.\nFirst, the defense asked that the motion deadlines in this case be extended by three weeks. Second,\nthe defense asked that the Government provide the defendant with a laptop on which to review her\ndiscovery at the Metropolitan Detention Center. Third, the defense asked that the Government\nprovide the defense with the names of the three Minor Victims listed in the Indictment by\nNovember 23, 2o2o.

She also moves to consolidate the instant appeal with the appeal pending in Gzuffre\nv. Maxwell, No. 2o-24l3. Meanwhile, the Government moves this Court to dismiss the appeal for\nlack of jurisdiction and opposes Maxwell’s motion to consolidate on the grounds that the issues\npresented on appeal are both factually and legally distinct. We assume the parties’ familiarity with the\nunderlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.\n\nThis Court has jurisdiction over the “final decisions of the district courts.” 28 U.S.C. § l29l.\n“Finality as a <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> of review is an historic characteristic of federal appellate procedure.”\nCobbledick v. United States, 3o9 U.S. 323, 324 (l94o). The “final judgment rule requires that a party\nmust ordinarily raise all claims of error in a single appeal follouing final judgment on the merits.”\nFlanagan v. United States, 465 U.S. 259, 263 (l984) (internal quotation marks omited). “This\ninsistence on finality and prohibition of piecemeal review discourage undue litigiousness and leaden-\nfooted administration of justice, particularly damaging to the conduct of criminal cases.” D7 Bella v.\nUnited States, 369 U.S. l2l, l24 (l962) (citing Cobbledick, 3o9 U.S. at 324-26). The final judgment rule\nis therefore “at its strongest in the field of criminal law.” United States v. Hollywood Motor Car Co., 458\nUS. 263, 265 (l982). In criminal cases, “finality generally is defined by a judgment of conviction and\nthe imposition of a sentence.” Florida v. Thomas, 532 U.S. 774, 777 (2ool) (internal quotation marks\nomited).\n\nThere is a “narrou” exception to the final judgment rule that permits appeals from\n“decisions that do not terminate the litigation, but must, in the interest of achieving a healthy legal\nsystem, nonetheless be treated as final.” Digital Equip. Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc, 5ll U.S. 863, 867—\n68 (l994) (internal quotation marks and citations omited).

Second, the defense\nasked that the Government provide a laptop for the defendant to use to review her discovery inside\nthe Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) by November 23, 2o2o. The Government has already\npurchased a laptop for such a purpose, and the MDC has agreed to allou the defendant use that\nlaptop for discovery review once the Government’s IT department has disabled all wireless and\ncommunications capabilities on the laptop. Accordingly, the Government agrees to meet this\n<span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>. Third, the defense asked that the Government provide it with the names of the three\nMinor Victims listed in the Indictment by November 23, 2o2o, and fourth, the defense asked that\nthe Government provide the defense with all Jencks Act material by November 23, 2o2o.\n\nThe Government cannot agree to the final two conditions set out by the defense, which\nhave no connection to the two-week delay in completion of discovery and no basis in law. The\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool829\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001830.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62 Filed ll/o8/2o Page 3 of 4\nPage 3\n\nfirst two conditions are reasonably related to the delayed production. The three-week extension\nof the defense’s deadline to file motions will ensure the defense has adequate time to review\ndiscovery before finalizing its motions and is therefore rationally related to the two-week delay in\nthis production. Similarly, the requested laptop will expedite and streamline the defendant’s\nreview of discovery by avoiding technological delays on the MDC computer system that may\notherwise slou the defendant’s discovery review.\n\nBy contrast, a two-week delay in the completion of discovery, caused by technical\nconstraints on the part of an outside vendor, has no bearing on the defense’s entitlement to a\nwitness list or witness statements. This Court has already ruled that such a request is premature\nwhen the “parties have not yet engaged in discussions regarding an appropriate schedule for\npretrial disclosures, including witness lists and § 35oo material.” (Dkt. 49 at l). The Court\naccordingly ordered that the parties ““meet and confer on an appropriate schedule” “[f]ollouing the\nclose of discovery.” (/d. at 2). Consistent with that order, the Government is prepared to engage\nin good faith discussions with the defense about an appropriate schedule for disclosure of Jencks\nAct and Giglio material. The standard practice in this District is to produce such material shortly\nin advance of trial, a practice that has been widely held to be sufficient to satisfy the requirement\nthat Giglio be produced “in sufficient time that the defendant will have a reasonable opportunity\nto act upon the information efficaciously.” United States v. Rodriguez, 496 F.3d 22l, 226 (2d Cir.\n2oo7). Immediate disclosure of such material is not warranted simply because the defendant\nprefers it. See, e.g., United States v. Wey, l5 Cr. 6ll (AJN), 2ol7 WL 23765l, at *23 (S.D.N.Y.\nJan. l8, 2ol7) (denying defendant’s motion for immediate disclosure of Giglio material as\ndefendant “fails to articulate any persuasive reason why immediate disclosure is required in this\ncase, and the Court otherwise sees no basis to deviate so substantially from the typical practice”);\nUnited States v. Thompson, l3 Cr. 378 (AJN), 2ol3 WL 62464839, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2ol3)\n(denying request for early production of Jencks Act material); United States v. Davis, No. o6 Cr.\n9ll (LBS), 2oo9 WL 637l64, at *l4 (S.D.N.Y. March ll, 2oo9) (“The Second Circuit has held\nthat a request for immediate or early disclosure [of Giglio material] has no basis in the law.”).\nBecause the Government’s two-week delay in completing discovery does not entitle the defense\nto such materials more than seven months in advance of trial, the Government respectfully requests\nthat the Court extend the deadline for this production to November 23, 2o2o solely on the first two\nconditions set out by the defense.\n\nOther than these responsive documents from Epstein’s electronic devices, the Government\nexpects to complete its production of Rule l6 discovery to the defense by the November 9, 2o2o\ndeadline. In that vein, the Government is currently preparing its sixth discovery production to the\ndefense, which will include, among other things, thousands of images and videos from Epstein’s\nelectronic devices identified as responsive to the expanded warrant, portions of iPads and an\niPhone seized from Epstein identified as responsive to the expanded warrant, the four emails\nquoted in the Government’s application for an expanded warrant, and documents from the FBI’s\nFlorida files. The Government expects to make that sixth production to the defense on November\n9, 2o2o.\n\nMoreover, while the Government appreciates that the volume of materials it proposes to\nproduce after the deadline is large, the Government has no reason to believe these materials will\nbe central to any motion the defendant may seek to make.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter to provide an update regarding the\ndefendant’s conditions of confinement at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) pursuant to\nthe Court’s Order dated August 25, 2o2o. (Dkt. No. 49). Over the past three months, the\nGovernment has had multiple conversations with MDC legal counsel regarding the defendant’s\nconditions of confinement. This update is based on information provided to the Government by\nMDC legal during those conversations.\n\nLast week, a staff member who was assigned to work in the area of the MDC where the\ndefendant is housed tested positive for COVID-l9. In response, the MDC implemented the same\nquarantine protocols that apply whenever an inmate has potentially been exposed to the virus.\nSpecifically, on November l8, 2o2o, the defendant was tested for COVID-l9 using a rapid test,\nwhich was negative. That same day, the defendant was placed in quarantine. As with any other\nquarantined inmate, the defendant will remain in quarantine for fourteen days, at which point she\nwill be tested again for COVID-l9. If that test is negative, she will then be released from\nquarantine. To date, the defendant has not exhibited any symptoms of COVID-l9.\n\nDuring her time in quarantine, the defendant will be housed in the same cell where she was\nalready housed before she was placed in quarantine, and medical staff and psychology staff will\ncontinue to check on the defendant every day. Like all other MDC inmates in quarantine, the\ndefendant will be permited out of her cell three days per week for thirty minutes. During that\ntime, the defendant may shouer, make personal phone calls, and use the CorrLinks email system.\nIn addition, the defendant will continue to be permited to make legal calls every day for up to\nthree hours per day. These calls will take place in a room where the defendant is alone and where\nno MDC staff can hear her communications with counsel.\n\nOn November l8, 2o2o, the Government provided the MDC with a laptop for the defendant\nto use to review discovery. During quarantine, the defendant has been and will continue to be\npermited to use that laptop in her isolation cell to review her discovery for thirteen hours per day,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool835\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001836.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 74 Filed ll/23/2o Page 2 of 2\nPage 2\nseven days per week. Accordingly, the defendant is receiving the same amount of time to review\nher discovery and the same amount of time to speak with her lawyers as she received before\nentering quarantine. The defendant will not, houever, be permited to meet in person with her\nlawyers until she tests out of quarantine.\n\nAfter the defendant tests out of quarantine, she will resume the same schedule that the\nMDC implemented approximately three months ago. Specifically, from 7am to 8pm every day,\nthe defendant will be permited out of her isolation cell. During those thirteen hours, the defendant\nwill have access to a computer on which to review her discovery outside of her cell. Also during\nthe day, the defendant will be permited to, among other things, make legal calls, make personal\ncalls, access CorrLinks, and shouer. From 8pm to 7am, the defendant will remain in her isolation\ncell. The defendant will also be permited to have in-person visits with her atorneys up to three\ndays per week for multiple hours per visit. On days when the defendant does not have in-person\nlegal visits, she will have access to legal calls for up to three hours per day.\n\nAs was the case three months ago, the defendant continues to have more time to review her\ndiscovery than any other inmate at the MDC, even while in quarantine. The defendant also has as\nmuch, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to communicate with her atorneys, even while\nin quarantine.\n\nAs noted above, over the past three months, the Government has repeatedly communicated\nboth with MDC legal counsel and defense counsel regarding the defendant’s conditions of\nconfinement. Whenever the defense has raised a concern on this topic, the Government has\nimmediately contacted MDC legal counsel to inquire about and, where appropriate, to address the\nconcern. The Government will continue to keep those lines of communication open and will\nremain responsive to any concerns raised by the defense regarding the defendant’s conditions of\nconfinement. Should the Court have any questions or require any additional details regarding this\ntopic, the Government will promptly provide additional information.\n\nRespectfully submited,\nAUDREY STRAUSS\nActing United States Atorney\nMaurene Comey / Alison Moe / Lara Pomerantz\nAssistant United States Atorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nTel: (2l2) 637-2324\nCc: All Counsel of Record (By ECF)\nDOJ-OGR-ooool836\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001837.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 75 Filed ll/24/2o Page l of 2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Nathan\n\nUnited States District Judge\n\nUnited States Courthouse\n\n4o Foley Square\n\nNew York, NY looo7\n\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell\n2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nAs counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell, we write in response to the leter from Sophia\nPapapetru and John Wallace, MDC staff atorneys. (See Dkt. 88.) The leter fails to address a\nnumber of concerns raised in our October 29\" leter to Warden Heriberto Tellez and raised with\nthe Court. The MDC’s leter also contains inaccuracies and omissions and raises more questions\nthan it atempts to answer. Rather than paraphrase our leter, we are providing it for the Court’s\nconsideration. (See Exhibit A.) We renew our request that Warden Tellez respond directly to\nthe Court and counsel and explain why Ms. Maxwell must be detained under such harsh and\nrestrictive conditions.\n\nUsing the term “[iJn her current assignment,” the leter atempts to present a picture of\ncompliance with total disregard of the deficiencies of Ms. Maxwell’s treatment up to this point.\nWhile her meals may currently be in accordance with BOP policy, until September they were\nnot. While her weight may currently be fairly consistent, she had lost over l5 pounds, and she is\nsustaining hair loss. It took approximately six weeks follouing arrival to the MDC for Ms.\nMaxwell to be permited personal calls on par with other inmates; previously she was given two\ncalls per month unless authorized by the warden. While generally permited to be out of her\nisolation cell and confined to the day room from 7:oo am to 8:oo pm with one hour of recreation\ntime, general population inmates are permited to be out of their cells until 9:3o pm and given\nmore extensive recreation time. While flashlight checks may be performed during regular\nrounds, Ms. Maxwell is subject to such checks every l5 minutes. Further, because Ms. Maxwell\nis kept in isolation, she in not permited to participate in activities accorded inmates in general\npopulation, such as programming (educational, leisure and wellness), movies, religious services,\njob assignment.\n\nTouting that Ms. Maxwell is not in contact with “a number of inmates who have tested\npositive for COVID-l9,” the MDC’s leter totally ignores that she was in contact with a member\nof her revolving security team who tested positive, necessitating that Ms. Maxwell be\nquarantined for l4 days. This further diminished her ability to prepare her defense and resulted in\ncancelled legal visits. While the leter accurately states that one video teleconference (VTC) was\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool866\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001867.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 9l Filed l2/o7/2o Page 2 of lo\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\nscheduled for August l7\", it fails to report that the VTC was unsuccessful because the audio\nconnection failed; and, despite constant ongoing requests, no subsequent VTCs have been\nscheduled.\n\nThe leter ignores the fact that there is an outbreak of COVID in the MDC, with some 8o\ninmates testing positive, far in excess of the number of positive cases reported from March to\nDecember. See htps://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/BOP (reported l2/7/2o). While Ms. Maxwell is\nisolated from general population inmates, the crew of security guards who monitor her 24/7 are\nnot subject to mandatory testing, with some guards assigned to her detail rotating in from BOP\nfacilities where inmates and staff have tested positive. And while Ms. Maxwell may not be\nexposed to other inmates, she is exposed to individuals while escorted to a common area for\nbody scanning, further risking her exposure to COVID.\n\nWhile reciting BOP policy, the leter fails to address:\n\n= why as an isolated inmate, Ms. Maxwell is subject to repeated searching;\n\n=» why Ms. Maxwell is under 24/7 surveillance by a cadre of officers who are\nrequired to report her status every l5 minutes;\n\n= why Ms. Maxwell is constantly surveilled by a hand-held camera, even during\natorney-client conferences;\n\n= why all of Ms. Maxwell’s legal emails were erased from the CorrLinks system;\n\n=\" why immediately after receiving two nasal swab COVID tests, Ms. Maxwell was\nrequired to remove her mask for an in-mouth inspection, heightening her exposure\nto COVID as she was placed in quarantine;\n\n= why Ms. Maxwell’s legal papers are repeatedly inspected.\n\nWarden Tellez has failed to respond to our assertion that the MDC has imposed\nextraordinarily onerous conditions of constraint on Ms. Maxwell to avoid the catastrophic\nconsequences of negligence occurring at the MCC that resulted in the death of Jeffrey Epstein.\nThe Atorney General of the United States has said as much. Beyond the decision to not place\nMs. Maxwell in general population, to which we have no objection, the leter virtually concedes\nthat other restrictions imposed on Ms. Maxwell are not in response to any concern specific to her\nand tacitly suggests the heightened restrictions are in response to the high-profile nature of the\ncase and the acknouledged failure by the BOP to keep Epstein — an actual threat to himself —\nalive. As ABC News reported:\n\nAtorney General William Barr told ABC News on Wednesday that he is keeping a close\n\nwatch to make sure that Maxwell makes it to trial after Epstein died by suicide in a\n\nManhatan jail while awaiting trial last year. Barr said he was \"/ivid \" Epstein died while\n\nin custody last August. The investigation into Epstein has continued even after his death.\n\nI believe very strongly in that case,\" Barr told ABC News on Wednesday. .. . “And as\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool867\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001868.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 9l Filed l2/o7/2o Page 3 of lo\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

And so\n\nI'm very happy that we were able to get Ms. Maxwell.”\n\nA source said the BOP is taking extra preventative measures to regain the public's trust\n\nand confidence as well as preserving the integrity of the Justice Department.'\n\nIt is obvious that Ms. Maxwell is bearing the brunt of BOP incompetence. Being “livid”\nover the death of Epstein, the Department of Justice is seeking to repair the BOP’s tarnished\nreputation by placing Ms. Maxwell under extraordinarily harsh conditions, not in any response to\nMs. Maxwell’s requirements, but rather in response to the failed handling of a completely\ndifferent inmate.\n\nMs. Maxwell has been an exemplary detainee. The psychological and physiological\nimpact of solitary isolation is well documented. Ms. Maxwell has not, by her conduct or by\nvirtue of the charges, brought this type of overly restrictive confinement upon herself. The\nconditions under which she is detained are punitive, unwarranted, deleteriously impacting her\nability to prepare her defense, and interfering with counsel’s ability to provide the legal\nrepresentation to which she, and any other detainee, deserves.\n\nThe MDC’s leter is insufficient. The warden of the institution bears responsibility for\nthe conditions under which Ms. Maxwell is confined.

Our immediate goal is to rectify these\nproblems and improve the extraordinarily restrictive conditions under which Ms. Maxwell is\npresently confined within your facility.\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, the Honorable Alison J. Nathan entered an order of detention\nremanding Ghislaine Maxwell to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons. She has been detained\nsince her arrest on July 2, 2o2o and has been incarcerated at MDC under conditions that rival\nthose at USP Florence ADMAX. An exemplary inmate who poses no threat to her personal\nsafety or danger to anyone, she has spent the entirety of her detention in de facto solitary\nconfinement, tantamount to imprisonment as a defendant convicted of capital murder and\nincarcerated on death rou. The conditions of her detention are uterly inappropriate, especially so\nfor a non-violent defendant with no prior criminal history facing non-violent charges a quarter-\ncentury old.\n\nWithout a doubt, the BOP has imposed extraordinarily onerous conditions of constraint\non Ms. Maxwell to avoid the catastrophic consequences of negligence occurring at the\nMetropolitan Correctional Center (MCC- Manhatan) which resulted in the death of Jeffrey\nEpstein. The Atorney General of the United States has said as much. The BOP has admited\nthat the sanctions are not in response to a specific threat that Ms. Maxwell has shoun; rather they\nare in response to the high-profile nature of the case and the acknouledged failure by the BOP to\nkeep Epstein — an actual threat to himself — alive. Ms. Maxwell is bearing the brunt of\nincompetence on MCC’s watch. As ABC News reported:\n\n' Previous leters were sent to you on August 28, 2o2o and September 9, 2o2o.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool87o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001871.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 9l Filed l2/o7/2o Page 6 of lo\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

And as you will recall, after he commited suicide, I said that I was confident\nthat we would continue to pursue this case vigorously and pursue anyone who's complicit\nin it. And so I'm very happy that we were able to get Ms. Maxwell.” A source said the\n\nBOP is taking extra preventative measures to regain the public's trust and confidence as\n\nwell as preserving the integrity of the Justice Department.”\n\nWhat is clear is that the Government is “livid” over the death of Epstein and is seeking to\nrepair its reputation by placing Ms. Maxwell under extraordinarily harsh conditions; not in any\nresponse to Ms. Maxwell’s requirements, but rather in response to the failed handling of a\ncompletely different defendant.\n\nMs. Maxwell has been an exemplary detainee who has never received a disciplinary\ndemerit. The purpose of this leter is not simply to express complaint due to the institutional\nviolations and denial of rights suffered by Ms. Maxwell in relation to her pretrial incarceration.\nRather, it seeks to bring an unwarranted situation to your atention - conditions that are unduly\ncruel and punitive and circumstances that are deleteriously impacting our client’s ability to\nprepare her defense which, in turn, interferes with our ability to provide the legal representation\nto which she, and any other detainee, deserves.\n\nWe continue our ongoing atempt to resolve these maters without court intervention. We\nhave voiced complaint through the MDC Legal Department, your office, the AUSAs in charge\nof this case, and the Federal Defenders of New York.* Ms. Maxwell has atempted to resolve\nthese maters by follouing the internal prison procedures, filing writen complaints to her unit\ncounselor (BP8), to the warden (BP9), and to the regional office (BP lo), to seek remediation as\nset forth in the BOP manuals and inmate handbook. All to no avail.\n\nDraconian Conditions of Pretrial Detention\n\nMs. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement are extraordinarily onerous - and unlike those\nof any other inmate at the MDC (or in BOP custody, to our knouledge). In fact, in the time that\nMs. Maxwell has been at the MDC, she has met with five separate wardens and interim wardens,\nmany who have remarked that they have never seen in their collective years of experience\n* See, “Ghislaine Maxwell given paper clothes at correctional center to avoid suicide atempt: Sources\nJeffrey Epstein, her associate, died by suicide in jail last August.”’ btps://abcnews.go.com/US/ghislaine-\nmaxwell-paper-clothes-correctional-center-avoid-suicide/story?id=7l699ooo (emphasis added).\n> The Federal Defenders of New York has been tasked with scheduling of atorney-client communication\nin connection with ongoing litigation against the MDC based on conditions of confinement during\nCOVID pending in the Eastern District of New York before the Honorable Margo K.

STERNHEIAA\nanything like her current regime.* The follouing conditions and circumstances of her detention,\nindividually and collectively, compromise her opportunity to confer with counsel and prepare her\ndefense for trial and are detrimental to her physical health and psychological well-being:\n\nDe Facto Solitary Confinement: Ms. Maxwell is the sole inmate in a housing unit. By\nthis Court’s order she is permited out of her approximately 9-by-7-foot isolation cell from 7:oo\nam to 8:oo pm, houever, she is frequently picked up late and returned to her cell promptly.\nWhen out of her cell, she is the sole inmate in a fenced off area of an unoccupied dormitory unit,\nwhere she eats, shouers, and reviews legal work while continually guarded by three officers.\n\nDespite being housed on an entire floor by herself, Ms. Maxwell is forced back into a tiny\ncorner of the floor. She is needlessly kept in a 63-square-foot space. She gets very litle sleep,\nas she is frequently woken up by flashlights every l5 minutes, loud discussions among the\nguards, and adjustments of the supplemental camera. Ms. Maxwell is effectively being kept in\nsolitary confinement (she has nou been housed alone for well over loo days) and treated as if\nshe were on suicide watch even though she is not and has never been suicidal.\n\nThe psychological and physiological impact of solitary confinement is well documented.\nMs. Maxwell has not, by her conduct or by virtue of the charges, brought this type of\nconfinement upon herself. This must be considered punishment.\n\nFurther, she has been required to stand for an hour waiting for the lieutenant to move her\nand during “the count” of inmates she is restricted to her bunk despite being housed in a one-\ninmate unit. She has at times been forced to do a standup count after midnight. Nou she is\nrequired to remain on a bed for the duration of the count.\n\nExcessive Scanning and Strip Searching: Ms. Maxwell is searched more frequently and\nextensively than any other pretrial detainee of which we are aware. All security scans to which\nMs. Maxwell have been subjected have returned negative results. Each time Ms. Maxwell is\nmoved from the isolation cell, she is searched and her cell is searched, and the dormitory is\nsearched prior to when she arrives at the dormitory area. Her cell and possessions including her\nlegal papers are searched after she has been moved to the dormitory. The process is repeated\nwhen Ms. Maxwell is brought back to the isolation cell. Recently, Ms. Maxwell was searched at\nleast five separate times and strip-searched twice during one day.\n\nMs. Maxwell is subjected to a body scans each week, and until recently, she received\napproximately three per week. We assume these are to see if Ms. Maxwell has secreted anything\ninside her body.

It is critical and we submit, as we laid out in our\n\n9 papers, that under the Bail Reform Act and related case law,\n\nlo none of which, by the way, was discussed in the government's\n\nll presentation, she is -- she ought to be released on a bail\n\nl2 package with strict conditions, your Honor.\n\nl3 And, frankly, in order to defend a case like this\n\nl4 during the COVID crisis, with the extent of discovery which was\nl5 discussed earlier in the proceeding, that's going to take the\nl6 government until November to produce to us, the notion of\n\nl7 preparing a defense with our client while she is in custody\n\nl8 under these conditions is just not realistic.\n\nl9 I would also like to take a moment, your Honor, to\n2o address a few things. As we noted in our papers, our client is\n2l not Jeffrey Epstein, and she has been the target of essentially\n22 endless media spin that apparently the government has picked up\n23 in its reply brief and in its presentation today, trying to\n24 portray her before the court as a ruthless, aimless, sinister\n25 person.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool9l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001922.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 45 of 9l 45\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl 377(l), and we understand that the court is follouing the\n\n2 statute. The statute gives alleged victims the right to speak\n3 through counsel, through the government, or directly, and be\n\n4 heard, and we understand that, your Honor.\n\n5 The question today before the court, we submit, is\n\n6 whether or not our client could be released or should be\n\n7 released on a <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions to assure\n8 her appearance. And as to that question, the presentations\n\n9 today do not speak, they do not speak to risk of flight, and\nlo the courts have -- in this circuit have thought about and\n\nll researched what weight should be given to that. There is an\nl2 opinion by Judge Orenstein in the Eastern District, United\n\nl3 States v. Turner, from April 2oo5, not cited by the government,\nl4 in which the court, after carefully surveying the legislative\nl5 history and background of the CVRA and its interplay with the\nl6 bail reform statute, concluded, \"In considering hou to ensure\nl7 that the rights are afforded, I am cognizant that the new law\nl8 gives crime victims a voice but not a veto. Of particular\n\nl9 relevance to this case, a court's obligation to protect the\n2o victim's rights and to carefully consider any objections that\n2l victim may have never requires it to deny a defendant release\n22 on conditions that will adequately secure the defendant's\n23 appearance,\" going on to cite the Senate legislative history\n24 that's being cited with approval of United States v.

And,\n\n4 again, we don't have spin. The big fact that the government,\n\n5 Ms. Moe tried to put before you through the victim is that\n\n6 supposedly someone had called in a civil action threatening the\n7 two-year-old child. Notice hou carefully that was phrased,\n\n8 your Honor. It wasn't tied to Ms. Maxwell. It's more spin,\n\n9 spin, spin.\n\nlo So we are here to consider bail. We should consider\nll the statute.

I determine\nl3 that that really disposes of the issue of what weight to give.\nl4 In turning to the statute, your Honor, turning to the\nl5 factors, I don't want to spend a lot of time on the standard,\nl6 because I knou your Honor is very familiar with it, but I do\n\nl7 want to point out that, in an opening brief and reply brief and\nl8 nou an oral presentation, the government has not once\n\nl9 represented the standard to your Honor nor the burden that it\n2o has. And that is the statute, under 3l42(c), says that \"even\n2l the case where there is not to be release ROR\" -- which this is\n22 not that case -- \"the court shall order pretrial release\n23 subject to the least restrictive <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of\n24 conditions.\" That as you nou read, of course, in light of\n25 3l42(e), (f), and (g), the provisions on detention, that the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool923\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001924.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 47 of 9l 47\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl law of the statute, by its structure, favors release. The\n\n2 Supreme Court has and the Second Circuit has advised us that a\n3 very limited number of people should be detained prior to trial\n4 because of the statute's structure, and the government nouhere\n5 mentions that. It basically acts as if all it has to do is\n\n6 invoke the presumption on the client and then we are done, and\n7 that's just not the legal standing, your Honor.\n\n8 They also say nothing about the burden, which is\n\n9 discussed on a case writen for the Second Circuit by Judge\n\nlo Raggi, and also the U.S. v. English case. Without going into a\nll lot of detail, as the court is aware, the burden of persuasion\nl2 is the government's. It never shifts.

We\n2l decided that we should come before your Honor with a package\n22 that was set out subject, of course, to the ruling provided by\n23 the court, subject of course to verification as to suretors by\n24 Pretrial Services and the court.

So what we did is we went through all the high\n\n2 profile cases in this courthouse in the past several years and\n3 other cases, cases like Madoff, cases like Dreier, cases like\n\n4 Esposito, where Judge Marrero ruled in 2ol8 relating to an\n\nS alleged member of organized crime, and we went through those\n\n6 cases to find the conditions that were listed under 3l42(c),\n\n7 and in those cases that would we believe be relevant and\n\n8 applicable here, and we believe we have listed them all.

The defendant has three passports. The\nll defendant has traveled internationally in the past, not in the\nl2 past year. There is no refutation from the government on that,\nl3 and they have been all over her travel records. The defendant\nl4 has resided here in the past year. She has traveled\n\nl5 internationally and, according to the government, she has\n\nl6 financial means. I will get to that in a moment, Judge. But\nl7 let's assume for the purposes of this discussion that she has\nl8 financial means and not the lies that the government laid out.\nl9 What do those cases teach? They teach that that is something\n2o the court can and should address in the bail conditions. They\n2l teach that they may require stricter bail conditions. They\n22 don't teach that that means there should be no bail at all. In\n23 Sabhnani, a Second Circuit case, the allegation was that the\n24 defendants have held two individuals in slavery for five years,\n25 and they had many more international ties or international\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool926\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001927.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 5o of 9l 5o\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl travel than alleged as to our client, certainly in the past\n\n2 year, and strict release was approved with strict bail\n\n3 conditions.\n\n4 In Bodmer, which was before Judge Scheindlin in 2oo4,\niy the defendant was a Swiss citizen, and Switzerland had taken\n\n6 the position it would not extradite its citizens for\n\n7 proceedings in the United States. And Judge Scheindlin\n\n8 observed, well, if that becomes the test for bail, then no\n\n9 citizen of Switzerland can ever get bail in the United States.\nlo So, too, here. If that's the test for France, then no French\nll citizen, under the government's reasoning, could ever get bail\nl2 in the United States.\n\nl3 And in Bodmer it was even the allegation -- the case\nl4 was a fraud case -- the allegation was that the defendant who\nl5 was a Swiss atorney had, according to the government, been\n\nl6 opening up Swiss accounts overseas and that that was some form\nl7 of hiding.

This bail proceeding should not turn into some\n\n9 mini investigation of our client's finances. The government\n\nlo has had ten years to investigate my client.\n\nll Let me address some of the specific allegations in the\nl2 government's brief. They point to a sale of property in 2ol6.\nl3 According to the government, the property was sold for $l5\n\nl4 million. There is no secret about that. Those records are out\nl5 there. The government claims our client cleared $l4 million\n\nl6 from that in 2ol6 and apparently has it all today, which would\nl7 probably make it the first New York real estate transaction to\nl8 that effect. There has been liabilities. There has been\n\nl9 expenses. Our client has been through extensive, substantial\n2o litigation all over this country denying these claims. We\n2l think the number is far less than what the government asserts.\n22 But even taking that number, it's a number far louer than that\n23 in Khashoggi, far louer than that in Dreier, far louer than in\n24 many cases, and the impact of that, in the court's discretion,\n25 should be addressed by bail conditions.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool937\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001940.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 63 of 9l 63\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl defendant, the less important it becomes to identify and\n\n2 restrain each and every asset over which defendants may\n\n3 exercise some control in order to mitigate risk of flight.\" So\n4 if the court -- and we have suggested them, but they may be\n\n5 modified by the court -- can put in place stringent bail\n\n6 conditions, we don't need to have a side-long, month-long\n\n7 hearing about my client's assets which is just designed to keep\n8 her in detention.

Thank you, counsel.\n\n8 I am prepared to make my ruling.\n\n9 Several provisions of federal law govern the court's\nlo determination whether to detain the defendant or release her on\nll bail pending trial. A court must apply that law equally to all\nl2 defendants no mater hou high profile the case or well off the\nl3 defendant. It is therefore important to begin here with a\nl4 clear articulation of the governing law.\n\nl5 It is also important to bear in mind that Ms. Maxwell,\nl6 like all defendants, is entitled to a full presumption of\nl7 innocence, that is, she is presumed innocent and the only\nl8 grounds for detention at this stage are, under the law, risk of\nl9 flight or danger to the community.\n2o I may consider the weight of the evidence proffered by\n2l the government at this stage in making this determination, but\n22 unless this mater is resolved by a plea, it will remain\n23 entirely for a jury to decide the question of Ms. Maxwell's\n24 guilt as to the charges contained in the indictment.\n25 Turning to the government's standard under Title l8 of\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool956\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001957.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 8o of 9l 8o\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl the United States Code, Section 3l42, the court may order\n\n2 detention only if it finds that no conditions or combination of\n3 conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person\n4 as required and the safety of any other person in the\n\n5 community.\n\n6 In making a bail determination the court must consider\n7 the defendant's dangerousness, if that's raised, and the\n\n8 defendant's risk of flight. A finding of dangerousness, if\n\n9 that were an issue, must be supported by clear and convincing\nlo evidence. A finding that a defendant is a flight risk must be\nll supported by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\nl2 In a case such as this one, where the defendant is\n\nl3 accused of certain offenses involving a minor victim, federal\nl4 law requires that it shall be presumed that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or\n\nl5 combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance\nl6 of the person as required. That's citing l8 U.S.C. 3l42(a) (3).\nl7 The Second Circuit has explained that, ina\n\nl8 presumption case such as this, a defendant bears a Limited\n\nl9 burden of production, not a burden of persuasion, to rebut the\n2o presumption by coming forward with evidence that she does not\nal pose a danger to the community or a risk of flight.\n22 Furthermore, once a defendant has met her burden of production\n23 relating to these two factors, the presumption favoring\n24 detention does not disappear entirely, but remains a factor to\n25 be considered among those weighed by the district court.

Instead, it rests its argument for detention on\n2o Ms. Maxwell's alleged risk of flight.

In other words, her federal indictment may\n\ni) well change her earlier decisions and, given the defendant's\n\n4 resources, the court concludes that Ms. Maxwell poses a\n\n5 substantial actual risk of flight.\n\n6 Having made this determination, the court next turns\n\n7 to whether the government has met its burden to shou by a\n\n8 preponderance of the evidence that no combination of conditions\n9 could reasonably assure the defendant's presence. The court is\nlo persuaded that the government has met this burden and concludes\nll that even the most restrictive conditions of release would be\nl2 insufficient.\n\nl3 As an initial mater, the financial component of\n\nl4 Ms. Maxwell's proposed bail package appears to represent a\n\nl5 relatively small component of the access available to her and\nl6 is secured only by a foreign property said to be worth about\n\nl7 several million dollars. But even a substantially larger\n\nl8 package would be insufficient. The extent of her financial\n\nl9 resources is demonstrated by some of the transactions and bank\n2o accounts discussed in the government's submission and here\n2l today, and Ms. Maxwell has apparently failed to submit a full\n22 accounting or even a close to full accounting of her financial\n23 situation. She has provided the court with scarce information\n24 about the financial information of her proposed cosigners, for\n25 example. Without a clear picture of Ms. Maxwell's finances and\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool963\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001964.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 87 of 9l 87\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl the resources available to her, it is practically impossible to\n2 set financial bail conditions that could reasonably assure her\n3 appearance in court.\n\n4 Even if the picture of her financial resources were\n\n5 not opaque, as it is, detention would still be appropriate.\n\n6 Personally, the defendant not only has significant financial\n\n7 resources, but has demonstrated sophistication in hiding those\n8 resources and herself. After the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein,\n\n9 Ms. Maxwell retreated from view. She moved to New England,\n\nlo changing locations on multiple occasions, and appears to have\nll made anonymous transactions both big and small. The defense\n\nl2 said that she did all of this not to hide from the government\nl3 but to maintain her privacy and avoid public and press\n\nl4 scrutiny. Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nl5 from the press and public, an assumption that the court does\n\nl6 not share, but even assuming that's the case, her recent\n\nl7 conduct underscores her extraordinary capacity to evade\n\nl8 detection, even in the face of what the defense has\n\nl9 acknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.\n2o Because of these concerns, even a bail package with\n2l electronic monitoring and home security guards would be\n22 insufficient. Were she to flee, the defendant could simply\n23 remove the monitoring bracelet and, as other courts have\n24 observed, home detention with electronic monitoring does not\n25 prevent flight. At best it limits a fleeing defendant's head\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool964\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001965.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 88 of 9l 88\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl start. Likewise, the possibility that Ms. Maxwell could evade\n2 security guards or monitoring is a significant one.\n\n3 The court finds by a preponderance of the evidence\n\n4 that no combination of conditions could reasonably assure her\n\n5 presence in court. The risks are simply too great.\n\n6 Defense cites a number of cases, including Esposito,\n\n7 Dreier, and Madoff, as examples of serious and high-profile\n\n8 prosecutions where the courts, over the government's objection,\n9 granted bail to defendants with significant financial\n\nlo resources. But unlike those defendants, Ms. Maxwell possesses\nll significant foreign connections.\n\nl2 This case is distinguishable for other reasons, as\n\nl3 well. For example, the risk of flight in Esposito appears to\nl4 have been based on the resources available to defendant, not\n\nl5 foreign connections or experience and a record of hiding from\nl6 being found.\n\nl7 In Madoff, the defendant had already been released on\nl8 a bail package agreed to by the parties for a considerable\n\nl9 period of time before the government sought detention. The\n2o court there found there were no circumstances in the\nal intervening period shouing that the defendant had become a\n22 flight risk. Because of these crucial factual differences, the\n23 court finds the cases not on point and not persuasive.\n24 Finally, in arguing for release, the defense raises\n25 the challenges and risks posed by the COVID-l9 pandemic.

The argument nonetheless fails in this case for several\na reasons. Most importantly, unlike almost all of the cases in\n\n6 which this court has granted release as a result of COVID-l9,\n\n7 Ms. Maxwell has not argued that her age or underlying health\n\n8 conditions make her particularly susceptible to medical risk\n\n9 from the virus. In other words, she doesn't argue that she is\nlo differently situated than many other federal inmates with\n\nll respect to the risk posed by COVID-l9.

The court notes that this case is at the\nal early stages. There will be no hearings, let alone a trial,\n22 for a significant period of time.

Because of these efforts, Ms. Maxwell can nou\npresent the follouing additional information in support of her renewed bail application:\n\n¢ Leter from Ms. Maxwell’s spouse. This leter demonstrates that Ms. Maxwell has\npouerful family ties to the United States that she will not abandon. It describes the\ncommited relationship between Ms. Maxwell and her spouse, who is a U.S citizen,\nand hou they lived a quiet family life — in the\nUnited States for over four years immediately prior to her arrest. The leter further\nexplains that Ms. Maxwell was forced to leave her family and drop out of the public\neye, not because she was trying to evade law enforcement, but because the intense\nmedia frenzy and threats follouing the arrest and death of Jeffrey Epstein threatened\nrhecatiey seeming of herelt tend hen Ser, A cr\nthese same reasons, Ms. Maxwell’s spouse did not come forward as a co-signer at the\ntime of the initial hearing.

These leters from\nMs. Maxwell’s other sureties and several family members and friends atest to Ms.\nMaxwell’s strong, forthright character and their confidence that she will not flee. The\nsureties also describe the significant financial distress they would suffer if Ms.\nMaxwell were to violate her bail conditions. (Exs. B-N, W-X).\n\n¢ Financial report. The financial report, prepared by the accounting firm Macalvins\nLimited, provides an accounting of Ms. Maxwell’s financial <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> from 2ol5-\n2o2o, and discloses (l) all of her oun assets, (i) all assets held in trust, and (il) all of\nthe assets held by her spouse over that same time period.

Their opinions also state that any\nextradition proceeding would be resolved promptly. (Exs. T-V).\n\n¢ Lack of corroborating evidence. The government represented to the Court that it\nhad “contemporaneous documents,” including “diary entries” in support of its case.\n(Dkt. 4 at 5). The defense has nou reviewed the discovery produced to date,\nincluding all of the documents that the government described as the core of its case\nagainst Ms. Maxwell. As explained more fully belou, the discovery contains no\nmeaningful documentary corroboration as to Maxwell and only a small number of\ndocuments from the time period of the conspiracy charged in the indictment. As an\nexample, the government produced onl\n3\nThe evidence in this case boils doun to witness testimony about events that took\nplace over 25 years ago. Far from creating a flight risk, the lack of corroboration\nonly reinforces Ms. Maxwell's conviction that she has been falsely accused and\nstrengthens her long-standing desire to face the allegations against her and clear\nher name in court.\n¢ Oppressive conditions of confinement. Ms. Maxwell has nou been detained\nfor over l5o days in the equivalent of solitary confinement since she was\nindicted and arrested on July 2, 2o2o, despite the fact that she is not a suicide\nrisk and has not received a single disciplinary infraction. The draconian\nconditions to which Ms. Maxwell is subjected are not only unjust and\npunitive, but also impair her ability to review the voluminous discovery\nproduced by the government and to participate meaningfully in the\npreparation of her defense. Furthermore, the recent COVID-l9 outbreak\nat the MDC threatens her safety and well-being.\nMs. Maxwell Should Be Placed on Restrictive Bail Conditions\nDuring her more than five months in isolation, Ms. Maxwell has had to watch as she has\nbeen relentlessly atacked in a deluge of media articles that spiked over a year ago when Epstein\n> Ms. Maxwell has not yet signed these waivers because we have not been able to visit her in the MDC to obtain her\nsignature since she was quarantined over two weeks ago. She will sign them as soon as legal visits resume.\n3 Ina leter dated October l3, 2o2o, we asked the government to provide additional discovery including. amon\nother things,\n\nIn light of the serious Brady\ninfractions in recent cases before this Court, and the recent order in this case pursuant to Rule 5(F) of the\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure (see Dkt. 68), the government’s failure to obtain is curious and\nconcerning.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool983\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001984.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97 Filed l2/l4/2o Page l2 of 45\n\nwas arrested and has shoun no signs of abating. Indeed, in the three months after her arrest, Ms.\nMaxwell was the subject of over 6,5oo national media articles. That exceeds the number of\narticles that mentioned such high-profile defendants as Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby, Joaquin\n“El Chapo” Guzman Loera, and Keith Raniere in the 9o-day period follouing their arrests,\ncombined. The media coverage has ruthlessly vilified her and prejudged her guilt, and has\nexposed her family and friends to harassment, physical threats, and other negative consequences.\n\nBut Ms. Maxwell is not the person the media has portrayed her to be; far from it. And\nher response to these unfounded allegations remains unchanged: she resolutely and vehemently\ndenies them, and she is steadfastly commited to remaining in this country, where she has been\nsince Epstein’s arrest in July 2ol9, to fight them in court. For Ms. Maxwell to flee, she would\nhave to abandon her spouse ee. She will not risk destroying the lives\nand financial well-being of those she holds most dear to live as a fugitive during a worldwide\npandemic. In fact, every action Ms. Maxwell has taken from the time of Epstein’s arrest up to\nthe time of the first bail hearing was designed to protect her spouse PF from\nharassment, economic harm, and physical danger. Ms. Maxwell wants to stay in New York and\nhave her day in court so that she can clear her name and return to her family.\n\nJustice is not reserved solely for the victims of a crime; it is for the accused as well.\nHere, justice would be served by granting Ms. Maxwell bail under the comprehensive conditions\nwe propose. The alternative is continued detention under oppressive conditions that are\nunprecedented for a non-violent pretrial detainee, which significantly impair her ability to\nparticipate in her defense and prepare for trial and which jeopardize her physical health and\npsychological wellbeing.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooool984\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001985.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97 Filed l2/l4/2o Page l3 of 45\nARGUMENT\nI. Reconsideration of the Court’s Bail Decision is Appropriate Under l8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3l42(f)\n\nA prior determination that a defendant should not be released on bail does not preclude\nthe Court from reconsidering its decision in light of new information.

For example, in United States v. Ward, 63 F. Supp. 2d l2o3 (C.D.

She writes:\n\nI do not have any other savings and it would be completely devastating\n\nfinancially and in every way to my oun family were the house to be taken\n\nover by the Government due to a breach of a bail conditions.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool99l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001992.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 2o of 45\n(/d.). Nevertheless, she has “no hesitation” posting her home because she knous “in every\nfibre of [her] being” that Ms. Maxwell “will never try to flee.” (d.).\n\nSimilarly, another surety who has agreed to sign a $3.5 million bond writes:\n\nThis amount represents the value of effectively all of my assets, including my\n\nhome fl If I lost these assets\n\nbecause Ghislaine violated the conditions of her release, I would be\n\nfinancially ruined. I make this pledge without reservation because I knou that\n\nGhislaine will remain in the United States to face the charges against her.\n\n(Ex. F). Two other sureties, one of whom is a U.S. citizen and resident, will post cash bonds\nin the amount of $25,ooo, and another will post $2,ooo in cash, which are significant\npledges for these individuals.\n\nIn addition to these bonds, the security company that will provide security services to\nMs. Maxwell upon her transfer into home confinement has agreed to post a $l million bond\nin support of her bail application. In our collective experience as defense counsel, we are\nnot aware of a previous example where a security company has posted a bond for a\ndefendant. The head of the security company has confirmed that they have never done this\nfor a defendant in the past but are willing to do so here because of his company’s “long-\nstanding relationship with Ms. Maxwell” and because he is “confident that she will not try\nto flee.” (Ex. S).\n\nIn sum, these bonds reflect the depth of support that Ms. Maxwell has from her\nfamily and friends, who are risking their livelihoods, their safety, and their ability to live\nwithout constant media harassment to support her. (See Ex. B) (“Absolutely anyone who\ndares to put their head above the parapet so to speak, to ... support Ghislaine personally, gets it\nshot off immediately amid a hail of social vilification and malignancy and reputational\nslaughtering.”). Ms. Maxwell would never destroy those closest to her by fleeing, after they\nhave risked so much to support her.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool992\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001993.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 2l of 45\nB. Ms. Maxwell Has Provided a Thorough Review of Her Finances for the\nPast Five Years\n\nThe government raised concerns at the initial bail hearing about the accuracy and\ncompleteness of the financial disclosures that Ms. Maxwell provided to Pretrial Services.\n(Dkt. 22 at ll-l2; Tr. 28-29, 34-35). The Court stated that it did not have “a clear picture of\nMs. Maxwell's finances and the resources available to her” and therefore had no way “to set\nfinancial bail conditions that could reasonably assure her appearance in court.” (Tr. 86-87).\n\nTo address the Court’s questions about Ms. Maxwell’s finances, defense counsel\nretained Macalvins, a highly reputable accounting firm in the United Kingdom, to conduct\nan analysis of Ms. Maxwell’s assets and finances for the past five years. The Macalvins\naccountants reviewed thousands of pages of financial documents, including bank statements,\ntax returns, FBAR filings, and other materials to create a clear picture of the assets held by\nMs. Maxwell and her spouse, as well as any assets held in trust for the benefit of Ms.\nMaxwell, and the source of those assets from 2ol5-2o2o. This analysis, which is based in\nsubstantial part on documents that the government provided in discovery, has involved a\nsignificant amount of work and has taken substantial time to complete. It was not possible\nto perform this analysis in the brief time between Ms. Maxwell’s arrest and the initial bail\nhearing, especially with Ms. Maxwell detained follouing her arrest.\n\nThe Macalvins report was also reviewed by ae. a Certified Fraud Examiner\nand a former IRS Special Agent with over 4o years of experience in complex financial fraud\ninvestigations. As a Special Agent, Lo investigated numerous financial fraud and criminal\ntax cases, including several in this District. p reviewed the Macalvins report and the\nunderlying documents and determined that it presents a complete and accurate summary of the\nassets held by Ms. Maxwell and her spouse, as well as assets that were, or are currently, held in\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool993\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002003.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 3l of 45\nIndeed, the discovery reflects that it was not hard at all for the government to locate Ms.\nMaxwell when they wanted to find her by tracking her primary phone.\n\nIn sum, the cellphone clearly shous that Ms. Maxwell was not “good at” hiding or\nthat she was avoiding arrest, as the government claimed. (Tr. 3l-32). She was trying to\nprotect herself as best as she could from harassment by the press, not capture by law\nenforcement. Moreover, this should not be a bar to granting bail. The proposed conditions\nensure her presence at home in plain sight of f | (and the security guards), GPS-\nmonitored, and under strict Pretrial supervision.\n\nD. Ms. Maxwell Has Waived Her Extradition Rights and Could Not Seek\n\nRefuge in the United Kingdom or France\n\nAt the initial hearing, the government argued that Ms. Maxwell, a naturalized U.S. citizen\nwho has lived in the United States for almost 3o years, might flee to the United Kingdom or\nFrance if granted bail, despite the fact that she did not leave the country for nearly a year after\nEpstein’s arrest. (Dkt. 22 at 6.) The government asserted in its reply brief that France “does not\nextradite its citizens to the United States pursuant to French law.” (/d.) At the bail hearing, the\ngovernment represented that “France will not extradite a French citizen to the United States as a\nmater of law, even if the defendant is a dual citizen of the United States,” and that extradition by\nthe United Kingdom would be “lengthy” and “uncertain” with bail “very likely” pending the\nextradition proceeding. (Tr. 27.) These assertions are incorrect, particularly given Ms.\nMaxwell’s irrevocable waiver of her extradition rights with respect to both the United Kingdom\nand France.\n\nAs we noted for the Court at the initial hearing, the concern that Ms. Maxwell would\natempt to flee the United States is entirely unfounded given that Ms. Maxwell had every motive\nand opportunity to flee after the arrest and death of Jeffrey Epstein, but chose to remain in this\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2oo3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002004.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 32 of 45\ncountry. (Dkt. l8 at l2-l4, Tr. 52-53). It is even more unfounded in light of the daily avalanche\nof media coverage of Ms. Maxwell. She is nou one of the most recognizable and infamous\npeople in the world. She is being pursued relentlessly by the press, which would no doubt be\ncamped out by her front door every day if she were granted bail. The notion that Ms. Maxwell\ncould somehou flee to a foreign country during a worldwide pandemic (presumably, by plane),\nwhile being supervised and monitored 24 hours a day and with the eyes of the global press corps\non her every minute, without being caught, is absurd.\n\nTo the extent the Court is concerned that her calculus may have changed since her arrest\nbecause the threat of prosecution has nou crystallized into concrete charges (Tr. 85-86), Ms.\nMaxwell has addressed that concern head-on—she will execute irrevocable waivers of her right\nto contest extradition in both the United Kingdom and France. (Ex. T). These waivers\ndemonstrate Ms. Maxwell’s firm commitment to remain in this country to face the charges\nagainst her. Moreover, as discussed more fully in the atached expert reports, because of these\nwaivers and other factors, it is highly unlikely that Ms. Maxwell would be able to successfully\nresist an extradition request from the United States to either country, in the extremely unlikely\nevent she were to violate her bail conditions. (Exs. U-V). Moreover, any extradition\nproceedings in either country would be resolved promptly. (d.).\n\nCourts have addressed concerns about a defendant’s ties to a foreign state that enforces\nextradition waivers by requiring the defendant to execute such a waiver as a <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> of\nrelease—including in cases where the defendants, unlike Ms. Maxwell, were not U.S. citizens.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Cirillo, No. 99-l5l4, l999 WL l456536, at *2 (3d Cir. July l3, l999)\n(vacating district court’s detention order and reinstating magistrate’s release order, which\nrequired foreign citizen and resident to sign an “irrevocable waiver of extradition” as a <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2oo4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002005.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 33 of 45\nof release); United States v. Salvagno, 3l4 F. Supp. 2d ll5, ll9 (N.D.N.Y. 2oo4) (ordering each\nof two defendants to “execute and file with the Clerk of the Court a waiver of extradition\napplicable to any nation or foreign territory in which he may be found as a <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> of his\ncontinued release”); United States v. Karni, 298 F. Supp. 2d l29, l32-33 (D.D.C. 2oo4)\n(requiring Israeli citizen who lived in South Africa and had “no ties to the United States” to sign\nwaiver of rights not to be extradited under Israeli and South African extradition treaties with\nUnited States); United States v. Chen, 82o F. Supp. l2o5, l2l2 (N.D. Cal. l992) (ordering as a\n<span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> of release that defendants “execute waivers of challenges to extradition from any\nnation where they may be found”). Moreover, a defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal an\nextradition order has been recognized as an indication of the defendant’s intent not to flee. See,\ne.g., United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48, lo52 (S.D.N.Y. l989) (Judge Keenan found\ndefendant’s extradition appeal waiver “manifests an intention to remain here and face the\ncharges against him”).\n\nIn response to the government’s assertions, Ms. Maxwell has obtained the accompanying\nreports of experts in United Kingdom and French extradition law, who have analyzed the\nlikelihood that Ms. Maxwell, in the event she were to flee to the United Kingdom or France,\nwould be able to resist extradition to the United States after having executed a waiver of her right\nto do so. Both have concluded that it is highly unlikely that she would be able to resist\nextradition successfully.\n\nUnited Kingdom. With respect to the United Kingdom, submited herewith is a report\nfrom David Perry (“Perry Rep.”), a U.K. barrister who is widely considered one of the United\nKingdom’s preeminent extradition practitioners. (Perry Rep. Annex B § 2.l) (atached as Exhibit\nU). Mr. Perry has acted on behalf of many overseas governments in extradition proceedings; has\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2oo5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002007.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 35 of 45\n\nMr. Julie opines that the French entity with jurisdiction over the legality of extradition\nrequests would not oppose Ms. Maxwell’s extradition on the ground that she is a French citizen,\nand that it is “highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an\nextradition decree” against her. (/d. at 2). Mr. Julie bases his opinion largely on (l) Ms.\nMaxwell’s U.S. citizenship; (i) her irrevocable waiver of her extradition rights with respect to\nthe United States; (ll) the fact that the issue would arise only if Ms. Maxwell had fled to France\nin violation of strict bail conditions in the United States; (iv) the fact that a failure to extradite\nwould obligate French authorities to try Ms. Maxwell in French courts for the same 25-year-old\nconduct alleged in the indictment, which did not take place in France; and (v) France’s\ndiplomatic interest in accommodating an extradition request from the United States. (/d.). Mr.\nJulie adds that the extradition process would likely be “disposed of expediently”; where the\nrequesting state emphasizes the urgent nature of the extradition request, “the extradition decree is\ngenerally issued in only a few weeks.” (/d. at 2-3). And in any event, while the extradition\nproceedings are pending, “the French judicial authorities would most certainly decide that [Ms.\nMaxwell] has to remain in custody given her flight from the USA and the violation of her bail\nterms and conditions in this requesting State.” (Ud. at l2).\n\nMs. Maxwell has no intention of fleeing the country and has relinquished her rights to\ncontest extradition. She has always maintained her innocence and will continue to fight the\nallegations against her here in the United States, as she has in the past. Even if she were to flee\nafter being granted bail (which she will not), it is likely that Ms. Maxwell would be extradited\nexpeditiously from France or the United Kingdom. Accordingly, the Court should give no\nweight in the bail analysis to the fact that Ms. Maxwell is a dual citizen of these countries.*\n\n* Ms. Maxwell would also have very litle incentive to flee to France. According to recent press reports, French\nauthorities recently broadened their existing criminal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein to include Ms. Maxwell.

The Proposed Bail Package Is Expansive and Far Exceeds What Is\nNecessary to Reasonably Assure Ms. Maxwell’s Presence in Court\nIn light of the additional information that Ms. Maxwell has provided in connection\nwith this submission, which responds to each of the concerns raised by the government at\nthe initial bail hearing, the government cannot meet its burden to establish that no set of bail\nconditions would reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in court. The proposed bail\npackage is exceptional in its scope, addresses all of the factors that the Court considered in\nevaluating risk of flight, and is more than sufficient to warrant her release from BOP\ncustody and transfer to restricted home detention.\nCourts in this Circuit have ordered release of high-profile defendants with financial\ngh-p\nmeans and foreign citizenship on bonds in louer amounts with less or no security with similar or\nless restrictive conditions:\neM rv} | pied | iV) | NO | NO | Iran | St Kits-Nevis |\nMEI ew\nME Ow\n_ Se $loM & | & | iv) | NO I. iv) | Saudi Arabia nl\nESPOSITO som | — & | GH | CG | Videoony) NO |\n$7.5M rv) | iV} | @ | NO | NO | Israel | South Africa _\n$5ooK NO NO | NO | _No | NO 2 (Denmark\nThe Court should also not give any weight to the government’s speculative assertions that\nothers might provide money and other support to Ms. Maxwell if she were to flee. (Dkt. 22 at\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2ol2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002013.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 4l of 45\nll-l2). Ms. Maxwell is not obligated to rebut every theoretical possibility that the government\nmight raise that may contribute to a potential flight risk in order to be granted bail. That is not\nthe standard. Cf United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 888 n.4, 892-93 (8th Cir. l985) (“The\nlegal standard required by the [Bail Reform] Act is one of reasonable assurances, not absolute\nguarantees.”). Ms. Maxwell has no intention of fleeing. If she did, then under the proposed bail\nconditions she would lose everything and destroy the family she has been fighting so hard to\nprotect since Epstein’s arrest. Ms. Maxwell will not do that, and should be granted bail.\n\nG. The Alternative to Bail Is Confinement Under Oppressive Conditions\n\nthat Impact Ms. Maxwell’s Health and Ability to Prepare Her Defense\n\nGranting bail to Ms. Maxwell is all the more appropriate and necessary because the past\nfew months have shoun that Ms. Maxwell cannot adequately participate in her defense and\nprepare for trial from the inside the MDC. The alternative to release is her continued\nconfinement under extraordinarily onerous conditions that are not only unjust and punitive, but\nalso meaningfully impair Ms. Maxwell’s ability to review the voluminous discovery produced by\nthe government and to communicate effectively with counsel to prepare her defense.\n\nMs. Maxwell has spent the entirety of her detention—nou over five months—in de facto\nsolitary confinement, under conditions that rival those used at USP Florence ADMAX to\nsupervise the most dangerous inmates in the federal system and are tantamount to imprisonment\nas a defendant convicted of capital murder and incarcerated on death rou. In fact, multiple\nwardens and interim wardens have remarked that in their collective years of experience they\nhave never seen anything like her current regime. The restrictive regulations to which Ms.\nMaxwell is subjected are not reasonably related to a legitimate goal to ensure the security of Ms.\nMaxwell or the MDC. Instead, it seems clear that the overly restrictive conditions are an\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2ol3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002014.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 42 of 45\nexaggerated response to Epstein’s death, effectively punishing Ms. Maxwell for the BOP’s oun\nnegligence with respect to Epstein.'!\n\nCounsel has atempted to address the restrictions in numerous leters, emails and calls to\nthe MDC warden, the MDC legal department, and the prosecutors, but to no avail. Rather than\nrepeating these points here at length, we refer the Court to our leter to the MDC warden, dated\nOctober 29, 2o2o, which details the most serious and extraordinarily restrictive conditions of\nconfinement.'” These include:\n\n« De Facto Solitary Confinement\n\n= Excessive Surveillance\n\n= Excessive Scanning and Strip Searching\n\n= Deprivation of Food\n\n= Deprivation of Sleep\n\n= Deprivation of Communication with Family and Friends\n\n= Compromised Communication with Legal Counsel\nThe conditions of Ms. Maxwell’s detention are uterly inappropriate, and totally disproportionate\nfor a non-violent pretrial detainee with no prior criminal history facing non-violent charges a\nquarter-century old. Moreover, they adversely impact her ability to prepare her defense and\ncompromise her physical health and psychological wellbeing.\n\nIn addition to these intolerable conditions, Ms. Maxwell has had to contend with\nnumerous unacceptable delays and technical problems with the discovery that the government\nhas produced to her thus far. We have raised these issues with the prosecutors on numerous\noccasions. As we advised the Court in our leter of October 23, 2o2o, defense counsel first\n\" These conditions are especially inappropriate because Ms. Maxwell has been an exemplary inmate and has not\nreceived any disciplinary infractions since her arrest. In fact, she has been made a suicide watch inmate, which is\nthe highest and most trusted responsibility that an inmate can have. It is the height of irony that Ms. Maxwell is\nbeing constantly surveilled as if she were a suicide risk when she, herself, is trusted enough (if she were ever\nreleased from isolation) to monitor inmates who are truly at risk of suicide.\n\nThe Warden never responded to the leter. In our response to the government’s 9o-day status report concerning\nMDC conditions, counsel requested that the Warden provide a first-hand report to the Court and counsel. Follouing\nCourt directive for a report from the MDC, MDC Legal submited a leter that recited BOP policy but failed to\naddress a number of concerns.\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2ol4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002016.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 44 of 45\n\nMs. Maxwell’s quarantine period also resulted in cancellation of weekly in-person legal\nvisits. This is likely to continue in light of the spike in COVID infection within and outside the\nMDC. Within a two-day period from December l to December 3, 55 inmates tested positive,\ncompared with 25 from March to December l. As of the date of this filing, the BOP reports 8o\nMDC inmates and staff with COVID.\"* If legal visits are suspended, it will further limit our\nability to review the voluminous discovery (well in excess of one million documents) with Ms.\nMaxwell and will further compromise her ability to prepare her defense. Moreover, as this Court\nobserved in United States v. Stephens, if an outbreak occurs “substantial medical and security\nchallenges would almost certainly arise.” Stephens, 447 F. Supp. 3d at 65. We urge the Court to\nweigh the threat of COVID as a factor favoring release in this case, as it did in Stephens.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nGhislaine Maxwell is commited to defending herself and wants nothing more than to\nremain in this country, with her family and friends by her side, so that she can fight the\nallegations against her and clear her name. She is determined to ensure that her sureties and her\nfamily do not suffer because of any breach of the terms of her bond. We have presented a\nsubstantial bail package that satisfies the concerns of the Court and the government, which\ncontains more than ample security and safeguards to reasonably assure that Ms. Maxwell\nremains in New York and appears in court. The Court has the obligation to ensure that a\ndefendant’s constitutional right to prepare a defense is safeguarded.

The information supplied by Ghislaine Maxwell’s office and by her spouse is\nincomplete due to the limited ability to access historic banking information from\nsome banks that have terminated their relationship either with Ghislaine Maxwell\nand/or her spouse.

In our professional opinion, notwithstanding the issues highlighted above, the\nconclusions that we reach in this report are substantiated by all of the data that we\nhave been able to review.\n\n7.

Ghislaine Maxwell’s net worth varied in the period under review.”\n\nl5. Ghislaine Maxwell and her spouse’s net worth at 3l October 2o2o is approximately\nUS$22,5oo,ooo. This is an estimate based on the 2ol9 tax filings to the end of\nDecember 2ol9 and review of bank statements and explanations provided by her\nspouse where bank statements are currently unavailable. This figure includes\napproximately $7.67m of advance legal retainer fees.\n\nl6. There has been no alienation of any assets in the period 2ol5-2o2o other than\nexpenditure in the ordinary course of family life and more recently since 2ol9 very\nsubstantial expenditure on professionals engaged in the defense of Ghislaine\nMaxwell from the criminal charges she faces.\n\nl7. In light of our inability to access all of the bank statements for the entire period for\nthe reasons already explained in paragraphs 3 and 4 above, we have not been able to\nreview every movement of cash from every account; we can, houever, deduce from\nstarting or opening balances and the closing balances that we have reviewed in each\nyear that no significant sum of cash has been transferred outside of the control of\nGhislaine Maxwell and or her spouse. All of the principal sources and uses of cash\nfrom 2ol5 through 2o2o are covered by this report of financial <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> without\nexception.\n\nSummary of Specific Transfers and Accounts\n\nl8. We noted that accounts controlled either by Ghislaine Maxwell and/or her spouse,\neither directly or indirectly, maintained substantial cash and equity balances of\napproximately $l6 million during the period under review. The cash and equity\nbalances clearly increased from the time of the disposal of the New York property.\nThere are many examples of transfers between accounts, movements triggered by the\nclosure of one banking relationship and the opening of new relationship (examples\ninclude the movement of cash and assets from as well\nmovements of cash maturing on deposit and other financial investments.\n\nl9. In its initial bail submission, the Government referenced transfers totaling more than\n$2o million in the earlier period of 2oo7-2oll which the Government described as\ntransfers from Jeffrey Epstein’s accounts to Ghislaine Maxwell’s accounts and vice\nversa. We noted in our review of the financial disclosure materials, that during the\nperiod 2oo7-2oll Ghislaine Maxwell acted as an officer of various corporate entities\nrelated to aircraft and air travel associated with Jeffrey Epstein and we noted\nsubstantial transfers involving these corporate entities. We did not note any transfers\nof this nature or the nature described by the government in the 2ol5-2o2o period\nwhich forms the subject of our Financial <span class=\"highlight\">Condition</span> Report.\n\n> Macalvins prepared a report of financial <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> for Ghislaine Maxwell dated April 3o\"\n2ol7 (see appendices to this report). The report recorded assets legally and beneficially\nouned by Ghislaine Maxwell on the balance sheet date. The specific liability recorded arose\nfrom a personal guarantee given by Ghislaine Maxwell.

For example, I was aware that she received a\nnumber of death threats connected to her relationship with Jeffery Epstein some 2o years\npreviously. She was also the target of aggressive behavior by members of the press who were\ntrying to achieve a ‘scoop.’ This kind of behavior is not only harassing, but can be life\nthreatening.

The United States of America has been designated as a ‘Part 2 territory’ (also referred to as a\n‘Category 2 territory’) for the purposes of the 2oo3 Act®. The effect of this designation is that\nextradition requests from the United States fall to be considered under Part 2 of the 2oo3 Act’, and the\nUnited States is exempted from the requirement to provide evidence sufficient to make a case to\nanswer against the requested person (‘the prima facie case requirement’).\n\n5. Once a valid’ request for extradition is made by a Part 2 territory, the Secretary of State must, subject\nto very limited exceptions’ not applicable here, issue a certificate under section 7o. Once a certificate\nis issued, the Secretary of State must send the request and certificate to the appropriate judge. In\npractice, it is extremely rare for the Secretary of State to refuse to issue a certificate under section 7o.\n\n6. Under Part 2 of the 2oo3 Act, a requested person may be arrested pursuant to either a full extradition\nrequest'’, or a provisional request pending the service of a full extradition request'”. In both cases,\nthere is an ‘initial hearing’ at which the requested person is produced before ‘the appropriate judge’!\n\n* Extradition Treaty between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, signed 3l March 2oo3 and ratified on 26 April 2oo7.\n“ The Extradition Act 2oo3 governs extradition to and from the United Kingdom.

Second, a court would be likely to consider that the interests of the\nvictims’’ would be best served by a trial in the United States. The High Court has held that the\ninterests of victims” “will be in having a trial at a place where, if they do give evidence or wish to be\npresent, they can be so” ”.

In order to rely on her physical or\nmental health in opposition to extradition, Ms Maxwell would need to serve evidence sufficient to\nmeet the statutory test.

The human rights objections that may conceivably be open to Ms Maxwell should she face\nextradition to the US in relation to the charges on the superseding indictment dated 7 August 2o2o\n\n35. Finally, it is highly unlikely that Ms Maxwell would be able to demonstrate that her extradition would\nbe incompatible with her rights under the ECHR**. The human rights grounds that might potentially\nbe relied upon by Ms Maxwell are considered in the paragraphs that follou®’.\n\nArticle 3 (prison conditions)\n\n36. Article 3 protects the right not to be subject to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment. The test is\nwhether substantial grounds have been shoun that, if extradited, the person faces a “real risk” of\ntreatment contrary to Article 3°°. The test is a stringent one and a strong case is required to make\ngood a violation of Article 3°’. Mistreatment must atain a minimum level of severity before Article 3\nis engaged. Prison conditions can meet that test although, whether they do, depends on all the\ncircumstances, including the personal characteristics of the detainee”’. Although Article 3 complaints\nbased on prison conditions are not uncommon in US cases, the courts have repeatedly rejected such\nsubmissions” ’”. Further, even if there were to be a case where the systemic conditions at one or more\nUS detention facilities were found to give rise to a serious risk that Article 3 would be breached by\nextradition, such difficulties are capable of being surmounted by the provision of assurances that the\nrequested person will not be detained in those particular prisons, or by giving guarantees in relation to\n\n*° Extradition Act 2oo3, s. 87.\n*7 There does not appear to be any basis upon which it could be said that the follouing rights are engaged: (a) Art. 2 (the\nright to life); (b) Art. 4 (freedom from slavery); (c) Art. 5 (unlawful detention); Art. 7 (no punishment without law); Art.\n9 (freedom of thought, conscience and religion); Art. lo (freedom of speech); Art. ll (freedom of assembly); Art. l2 (the\nright to marry); Art. l4 (discrimination); Arts. l-3 of the First Protocol (protection of property; right to education; right to\nfree elections); and Art. l of the Thirteenth Protocol (abolition of the death penalty).\n88 Soering v United Kingdom (l989) ll EHRR 439, paras. 88 and 9l.\n*° Elashmawy v Court of Brescia, Italy and Ors [2ol5] EWHC 28 (Admin), para. 49.\n°° Ireland v United Kingdom (l979-8o) 2 EHRR 25, para. l62.\n*!

The decision in Love was based on section 9l of the 2oo3\nAct, and the court made no finding under Article 3 (para l23). In Hafeez, which was decided in January 2o2o, the High\nCourt received the same evidence as has been before the court in Zove, and concluded that “the evidence in this case falls\nwell short of the necessary threshold” to prove a breach of Article 3 based on the conditions at MDC and MCC (see\nHafeez v Government of the United States of America [2o2o] EWHC l55 (Admin), para. 66).\nl922623.l\nl2\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2lo8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002109.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-2l Filed l2/l4/2o Page l4 of 29\nspecific concerns, such as access to medical care”’. In those circumstances, it is highly unlikely that\nMs Maxwell would be able to rely on Article 3 to defeat a request for her extradition.\nArticle 6 (fair trial)\n\n37. Article 6 ECHR protects the right to a fair trial, and the European Court of Human Rights has noted\nthat Article 6 is “strikingly similar” to the Eighth Amendment to the US Constitution”. An issue may\nexceptionally be raised under Article 6 in an extradition case in circumstances where the requested\nperson risks suffering a flagrant denial of justice in the requesting country”. The test of ‘flagrant\ndenial’ is particularly high, requiring a court to find not only that the trial would be unfair, but that\nthere would be “a total nullification of the right to a fair trial’”® In practice, this threshold is rarely\novercome in extradition cases and it has never been met in a US extradition case. In those\ncircumstances, it is highly unlikely that Ms Maxwell would be able to successfully invoke Article 6 to\nresist her extradition.\n\nArticle 8 (private and family life)\n\n38. Article 8 ECHR protects the right to private and family life. In assessing Article 8, the court is\nrequired to conduct a balancing exercise where factors in favour of extradition, including the\n“constant and weighty” public interests in honouring extradition treaties and ensuring that people\naccused of crimes should be brought to trial, are weighed against any personal or other factors that\nwould render extradition an interreference with private or family life. The test is whether any\ninterference would be disproportionate to the legitimate aims pursued by extradition”. In practice, the\nmore serious the offence, the more difficult it is to establish that extradition would be\ndisproportionate. Given the nature of the charges that she faces, it is highly unlikely that such an\nargument would succeed in Ms Maxwell’s case.\n\nConclusion\n\n39. In conclusion, if the United States were to request Ms Maxwell’s extradition in circumstances where\nshe had absconded to the United Kingdom in breach of bail conditions imposed in the United States, it\nis extremely unlikely that she would be granted bail and highly unlikely that she would be able\n\n*? See, for example, Miao at para. 37 where the court stated that: “Assurances are commonly given in extradition cases in\norder to mitigate risks which might otherwise bar extradition. It is common for assurances to be given in respect of\nconditions of detention and the treatment of physical and mental illness (and associated suicide prevention) and they\nform an important part of extradition law”.\n** Ahmad v United Kingdom 5l EHRR SE6, para. l33.\n”> Othman v United Kingdom (2ol2) 55 EHRR l, para. 258.\n°° Othman, para. 26o.\n\"7 R (on the application of HH) v Westminster City Magistrates’ Court [2ol3] l AC 338, para. 3o.\nl922623.l\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2lo9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002112.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-2l Filed l2/l4/2o Page l7 of 29\nAnnex A — Questions set out in the Peters and Peters instructions dated l2 August 2o2o\nCounsel is instructed to prepare an expert opinion in respect of the follouing:\n\n(a) Outline the extradition arrangements between the United Kingdom and the United\nStates, including an overview of the general manner in which the arrangements work\nand the general timeframe for UK extradition proceedings in relation to requests from\nthe US.

Athe bail hearing of Ms Ghislaine Maxwell on l4 July 2o2o, the US Government made\n\nthe follouing point in support of its motion to detain the defendant:\n“The government has spoken with the Department of Justice ataches in the\nUnited Kingdom and France. With respect to France, we have been informed\nthat France will not extradite a French citizen to the United States as a\nmater of law, even if the defendant is a dual citizen of the United States.””.\n\n2. The international ties of Ms Ghislaine Maxwell and her French nationality appear as one\nof the grounds for which bail was denied by the Court, which found that:\n\n“Ms Maxwell’s history and characteristics support the position of her posing a risk of\nflight. Ms Maxwell has substantial international ties and could facilitate living abroad\nif she were to flee the United States. She holds multiple foreign citizenships, has familial\nand personal connections abroad, and ouns at least one foreign property of significant\nvalue. In particular, she is a citizen of France, a nation that does not appear to\nextradite its citizens”.\n\n3. The present report intends to evaluate whether the contention that France is a nation that\ndoes not extradite its citizens is correct as a mater of law.\n\n4. It will first set out the various steps of the French extradition procedure (Part I, and\nthen outline the grounds on which extradition requests are analyzed under French law,\nand especially the status of the rule against extradition of nationals, in order to assess the\napplication of these principles to an extradition request made by the USA, in particular\nwhere, as in this case, the requested person has executed an irrevocable waiver of his/her\nright to contest extradition and is present in France only because she fled the United\nStates in violation of her bail conditions.

Fourth stage: Decision of the Investigating Chamber of the competent Court of\n\nappeal\n\nl8. Once the requested person has declared to the Prosecutor General whether he consents\nor not to extradition, the Investigating Chamber is immediately seized of the case. This\nphase varies depending on whether the requested person consents to extradition.\n\nl9. If the requested person has declared to the Prosecutor General that he or she consents to\nextradition, Article 696-l3 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure provides that he\nor she must appear before the Investigating Chamber within 5 working days from the\ndate of presentation before the Prosecutor General. The same provision states that the\nrequested person may also decide to waive the rule of specialty before the Prosecutor\nGeneral.\n\n2o. If, at this appearance, the requested person confirms his or her consent to be extradited\nand the legal conditions for extradition are fulfilled, the Investigating Chamber informs\nthe person of the legal consequences of such consent and formally acknouledges this\nconsent within 7 days from the date of appearance, unless additional investigations have\nbeen ordered’,\n\n2l. The rules of this simplified extradition procedure must be read in light of Article ll of\nthe Agreement on Extradition between the European Union and the USA of 25 June\n2oo3 (“Simplified extradition procedures”), which states that “if the person sought\nconsents to be surrendered to the requesting State, the requested State may, in\naccordance with the principles and procedures provided for under its legal system,\nsurrender the person as expeditiously as possible without further proceedings. The\nconsent of the person sought may include agreement to waiver of protection of the rule\nof specialty”!°.

In this case, if an extradition request were to be transmited by the USA against Ms\nGhislaine Maxwell, the French judicial authorities would most certainly decide that she\nhas to remain in custody given her flight from the USA and the violation of her bail terms\nand conditions in this requesting State.\n\n34. Having outlined the different stages of the French extradition procedure, the second part\nof this opinion will examine the likely outcome of an extradition request against the\nperson of Ms Ghislaine Maxwell, if she were to be released on bail and decided to flee\nfrom the USA to France. It will first outline the general bars to extradition (A), and then\nanalyze the status of the protection of nationals from extradition in the French legal\nsystem and in the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France (B). It will conclude\nthat Ms Ghislaine Maxwell’s extradition from France to the USA would not be legally\nbarred by her French citizenship, and that it is highly unlikely, under the specific and\nunique circumstances of this case, that French authorities will refuse to enforce an\nextradition decree.\n\nA. General bars to extradition\n\n35. Several bars to extradition may classically be invoked before French courts, namely (l)\na claim that the requested person would be at risk of human rights violations in the\nrequesting State (with regards to the right to a fair trial and the right to be free from\ntorture, inhumane or degrading treatment); (ll) the dual criminality rule; and (i) a claim\nthat the extradition request is politically motivated.\n\n(i) Human rights bars\n\n36. Under the case law of the French Cour de cassation, the Investigating Chamber of the\nCourt of appeal must consider allegations of human rights violations pertaining to the\nconditions of trial and detention in the requesting State!’. These claims center on the\nright to a fair trial (Article 6 ECHR)!° and the right to be free from torture, inhumane\n\n5 Cass. Crim., 26 March 2ol9, nNo. l9-8l73l.\nl6 Einhorn v.

Chapter V of the French Code of Criminal Procedure (Articles 696 to 696-47-l) sets out\nlegislative provisions pertaining to extradition.\n\n53. The rule against the extradition of nationals is set out under Article 696-4, which states\nthat extradition shall not be granted when the requested person is a French national, and\nthat nationality shall be assessed at the time of the facts in respect of which extradition\nis sought (« Extradition is not granted: l° When the person sought has the French\nnationality, the later being assessed at the time of the offence for which extradition is\nrequested. »»”’),\n\n54. The rule under Article 696-4 only applies “in the absence of an international\nconvention stipulating otherwise”*®, Therefore, we must determine whether the rule\nagainst the extradition of nationals contained in the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure applies in respect of an extradition request made by the USA.\n\n55. Extradition requests between the United States and France are governed by the\nExtradition Treaty between the USA and France l996”, which supersedes French law\nas mentioned explicitly in Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure.\n\n56. Article 3(l) of the Extradition Treaty between France and the United States provides:\n\n“There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the extradition of a\nperson who is a national of the Requested State, but the executive authority of the\nUnited States shall have the pouer to surrender a national of the United States if,\nin its discretion, it deems it proper to do so. The nationality of the person sought\nshall be the nationality of that person at the time the offense was commited”.\n27 Tn French : « L'extradition n'est pas accordee : l° Lorsque la personne reclamee a la nationalite francaise, cete\nderniere etant appreciee a l'epoque de l'infraction pour laquelle l'extradition est requise ».\n28 Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure: “In the absence of an international convention stipulating\notherwise, the conditions, procedure and effects of extradition shall be determined by the provisions of this chapter.\nThese provisions shall also apply to maters which would not have been regulated by international conventions”. (In\nFrench, « En l'absence de convention internationale en stipulant autrement, les conditions, la procedure et les\neffets de l'extradition sont determines par les dispositions du present chapitre. Ces dispositions s'appliquent\negalement aux points qui n'auraient pas ete reglementes par les conventions internationales »).\n° The Extradition treaty between the USA and France was signed in Paris on April 23, l996 and entered into force\non February l, 2oo2 (by Decree No. 2oo2-ll7 of 29 January 2oo2).\n5l, rue Ampere - 75ol7 paris - tel. ol 88 33 5l 8o — fax. ol 88 33 5l 8l wj@wjavocats.com - l7\nwww.wjavocats.com - palais Cl652\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l42\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002147.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-22 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 23 of 3o\nWilliam JULIE\navocat a la cour — atorney at law\na United States citizen. Thus, there is no precedent to draw from in that\nregard. Houever, it is our view that under the specific and unique facts of this case, it is\nhighly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an\nextradition decree against Ms Maxwell because of several critical factors.\n\n78. First, under the applicable Extradition Treaty between the USA and France, a State party\nmay refuse extradition on the basis of nationality, houever if it does so, it is obliged to\nprosecute the requested person itself, on the basis of the conduct and the allegations\ncontained in the request. In the case of Ms Ghislaine Maxwell, it is highly unlikely that the\nFrench government would be inclined to conducting such prosecution, considering that all\nthe relevant facts were commited in the USA, a long time ago, and that witnesses are also\nlocated in the USA.\n\n79. Secondly, France is mindful to preserve its good extradition relations with the United\nStates, as evidenced by a number of recent cases we reviewed or conducted in which\nFrench competent authorities proved highly cooperative with US authorities. If Ms\nGhislaine Maxwell were to flee to France, and the USA decided to issue an extradition\nrequest, it would be difficult for French authorities — from a diplomatic point of view — to\ndeny such an extradition request, considering that no legal bar applies.?”\n\n8o. Thirdly, the fact that Ms Ghislaine Maxwell also holds American nationality, and has\nsubstantial ties to the USA, would, in all likelihood, be taken into account by the French\ngovernment as one more element weighing in favor of extradition.\n\n8l. Similarly, and fourthly, the fact that Ms Ghislaine Maxwell signed a legally binding\nWaiver under US law, and would have subsequently fled to France in violation of her bail\nconditions, could equally be taken into account by the French government as an incentive\nnot to grant Ms Ghislaine Maxwell the benefit of her French nationality as a ban to\nextradition.\n\nWilliam Julie\n37 Of the 36 reported Supreme Court decisions involving extradition requests from the United States in the last 2o\nyears, the French authorities granted extradition in 34 of these cases.

In short, the defendant poses an extreme\nflight risk, no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions can reasonably ensure her appearance in this\nDistrict, and the Court should not alter its prior finding to that effect.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAs detailed in the Indictment, the defendant is charged with facilitating the sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims by Jeffrey Epstein between approximately l994 and l997. The defendant\nplayed a critical role in the scheme by helping to identify, entice, and groom minor girls to engage\nin sex acts with Epstein. The defendant’s presence as an adult woman normalized Epstein’s\nabusive behavior, and she even took part in at least some acts of sexual abuse. Together, the\ndefendant and Epstein conspired to entice and cause minor victims to travel to Epstein’s residences\nin different states, which the defendant knew and intended would result in their grooming for and\nsubjection to sexual abuse. Then, in an effort to cover up her crimes, the defendant lied under oath\nduring a civil deposition, including when asked about her interactions with minor girls.\n\nBased on that conduct, the Indictment charges the defendant in six counts. Count One\ncharges the defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage\nin illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Count Two charges the defendant with enticing\na minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2. Count\nThree charges the defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minors to\nparticipate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Count Four charges the defendant\nwith transporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2423 and 2.\nCounts Five and Six charge the defendant with perjury, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l623.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l66\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002167.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 6 of 36\n\nOn July 2, 2o2o, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) arrested the defendant.\nFollouing extensive briefing, on July l4, 2o2o, the Court held a lengthy bail hearing. In its writen\nand oral submissions, the defense urged the Court to release the defendant on bail.\n\nAmong other things, the defense emphasized the defendant’s family ties and residence in\nthe United States (Dkt. l8 at 2, 3, l2), offered to hire a private security company to monitor the\ndefendant (/d. at 2o), noted that the defendant remained in the country and was in touch with the\nGovernment through counsel follouing Epstein’s arrest (Dkt. l8 at l2-l3; Tr. 49, 52-55), argued\nthat the defendant went into hiding to avoid a media frenzy (Dkt. l8 at l4-l6; Tr. 55-56), and\nargued that detention would hamper the ability to prepare a defense (Tr. 42, 67-69). Responding\nto the Government’s concerns about the lack of transparency about the defendant’s finances and\nsix proposed co-signers, the defense specifically asked the Court to keep the proceedings open if\nthe Court believed additional information or a more fulsome bond would be useful to the bail\ndetermination. (Tr. 52 (“And if the court determines that the conditions that we have proffered are\ninsufficient or need further verification, as long as we can have some assurance of safety and\nconfidentiality, we would recommend that the court keep the proceeding open, and we should be\nable to get whatever the court needs to satisfy it.”); Tr. 59 (“Even if the court were to assume for\npurposes of today’s proceeding that she has the means that the government claims she does, it does\nnot affect the analysis. That is to be addressed in conditions, to be addressed if the court requires\nit, through verifications and further proceedings before the court.”); Tr. 66 (“If the court desires to\nleave the proceeding open for a week and allou us to come back, if the court has concerns about\nthe number of suretors, for example, verification information, information about financial issues,\nwe think that, nou that we have some ability to breathe a litle bit, that we should be able to pull\nthis together for the court’s consideration.”); Tr. 7o (“And if the court needs more information\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l67\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002168.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 7 of 36\nfrom us, we would respectfully request that the court leave the proceeding open for a week so that\nwe can try to satisfy the court because we want to.”)).\n\nThe Court declined the defense’s request and instead concluded that the defendant posed a\nserious flight risk and that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance. First, the\nCourt found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense here weigh in favor of detention,”\ngiven the statutory presumption of detention triggered by charges involving minor victims and the\npotential penalties those charges carry. (Tr. 82). Second, the Court determined that “[t]he\ngovernment’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong” based on the “multiple\nvictims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in serious crimes,” as well\nas corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Jd.).\nThird, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics demonstrate that the\ndefendant poses a risk of flight. (Tr. 83).\n\nIn addressing that third factor, the Court emphasized the defendant’s “substantial\ninternational ties,’ which “could facilitate living abroad,’ including “multiple foreign\ncitizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least one foreign property of\nsignificant value.” (Tr. 83). The Court also noted that the defendant “is a citizen of France, a\nnation that does not appear to extradite its citizens.” (/d.). The Court further found that the\ndefendant “possesses extraordinary financial resources” and that “the representations made to\nPretrial Services regarding the defendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid\npicture of the resources available.” (Tr. 83-84).\n\nAlthough the Court recognized that the defendant “does have some family and personal\nconnections to the United States,” the Court highlighted “the absence of any dependents,\nsignificant family ties or employment in the United States” in support of the conclusion that “flight\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2l68\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002169.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 8 of 36\n\nwould not pose an insurmountable burden for her.” (Tr. 84). The Court recognized the defense\narguments that the defendant did not leave the United States after Epstein’s arrest and was in\ncontact with the Government through counsel, but emphasized that the defendant may have\nexpected that she would not be prosecuted. (Tr. 84-85). The Court also noted that the defendant\n“did not provide the government with her whereabouts,” and that the “[c]ircumstances of her arrest\n... may cast some doubt on the claim that she was not hiding from the government, a claim that\nshe makes throughout the papers and here today, but even if true, the reality that Ms. Maxwell may\nface such serious charges herself may not have set in until she was actually indicted.” (Tr. 85).\nBased on all of those factors, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of\ndemonstrating that the defendant “poses a substantial actual risk of flight.” (Tr. 86).\n\nThe Court then concluded that “even the most restrictive conditions of release would be\ninsufficient” to ensure the defendant’s appearance. (/d.). Acknouledging that the defense’s initial\nbail package represented only a fraction of the defendant’s assets, the Court found that “even a\nsubstantially larger package would be insufficient.” (/d.). Although the defendant “apparently\nfailed to submit a full accounting or even close to full accounting of her financial situation,” the\nCourt implicitly rejected the defense’s offer to provide additional information by determining that\n““/e/ven if the picture of her financial resources were not opaque, as it is, detention would still be\nappropriate.” (Tr. 86-87 (emphasis added)). That conclusion was informed not only by the\ndefendant’s “significant financial resources,” but also her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (Tr. 87). “Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nfrom the press and the public,” the Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent conduct\nunderscores her extraordinary capacity to evade detection, even in the face of what the defense has\nacknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.). Given that sophistication,\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l69\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002170.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 9 of 36\n\nthe Court concluded that electronic monitoring and home security guards “would be insufficient”\nbecause the defendant could remove the monitor and evade security guards. (Tr. 87-88). Finally,\nthe Court rejected the defense’s arguments about the risks of COVID-l9 and the difficulty of\npreparing a defense with an incarcerated client. In so doing, the Court noted that the defendant\nhas no underlying conditions that place her at heightened risk of complications from COVID-l9\nand emphasized that the defendant had many months to prepare for trial. (Tr. 89-9o).\n\nViewing all of these factors together, the Court ordered the defendant detained pending\ntrial. (Tr. 9l).\n\nAPPLICABLE LAW\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant detained pending trial upon a determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). When seeking detention on this ground, “[t]he Government bears the\nburden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence both that the defendant ‘presents an actual\nrisk of flight’ and that ‘no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions could be imposed on the\ndefendant that would reasonably assure his presence in court.’” United States v. Boustani, 932\nF.3d 79, 8l (2d Cir. 2ol9) (quoting United States v. Sabhani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7)). The\nBail Reform Act lists three factors to be considered in the detention analysis when the Government\nseeks detention based on flight risk: (l) the nature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2)\nthe weight of the evidence against the person; and (3) the history and characteristics of the\ndefendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and] financial resources.” See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(g). If a judicial officer concludes that “no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions will\nreasonably assure the appearance of the person as required . . . such judicial officer shall order the\ndetention of the person before trial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l7o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002171.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page lo of 36\n\nAdditionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with commiting an offense involving\na minor victim under l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, it shall be presumed, subject to rebutal, that no\n<span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as\nrequired and the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). In such a case, “the\ndefendant ‘bears a limited burden of production—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut\nthat presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose . . . a risk of flight.’”\nUnited States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting United States v. Mercedes,\n254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool)). The act of producing such evidence, houever, “does not\neliminate the presumption favoring detention.” /d. Rather, the presumption “remains a factor to\nbe considered among those weighed by the district court,’ while the Government retains the\nultimate burden of demonstrating that the defendant presents a risk of flight. Mercedes, 254 F.3d\nat 436.\n\nWhen the Court has already issued a detention order, the Bail Reform Act provides that the\ndetention hearing “may be reopened . . . if the judicial officer finds that information exists that was\nnot knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue of\nwhether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the appearance” of the\ndefendant. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f). Accordingly, “[a] court may properly reject an atempt to reopen\na detention hearing where the new information presented is immaterial to the issue of flight risk.”\nUnited States v. Petrov, l5 Cr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26,\n2ol5). Although courts in this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered\neven where the evidence proffered on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the\noriginal hearing,” United States v. Roue, o2 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y.\nMay 2l, 2oo3), generally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l7l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002172.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page ll of 36\nreconsideration” by, for example, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or\nincorrectly applied the law,” or that failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.”\nPetrov, 2ol5 WL llo2286 at *3.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nHaving already raised numerous arguments in its briefing and oral argument at the initial\nbail hearing in this case, the defense nou asks this Court to reverse itself based on virtually the\nsame arguments it already rejected. The Renewed Bail Application largely reiterates the same\nclaims regarding the defendant’s ties to the United States and her behavior after Epstein’s arrest\nthat the Court already found unpersuasive. To the extent the Renewed Bail Application presents\nnew information, it consists primarily of financial data that was certainly knoun to the defendant\nat the time of her initial bail application and that the Court already assumed could be made\navailable (and thus rejected as immaterial) when ordering detention. Ultimately, nothing in the\nRenewed Bail Application alters the analysis that led this Court to conclude that the defendant\n“poses a substantial actual risk of flight,” and that no combination of conditions could assure her\nappearance. (Tr. 86). All three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors still weigh heavily in favor\nof detention, and the defense claims to the contrary do not warrant a revisiting of this Court’s well-\nreasoned and thorough prior decision.\n\nA. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense\n\nThe first Bail Reform Act factor indisputably weighs in favor of detention in this case. The\negregious conduct charged in the Indictment gives rise to a statutory presumption of detention, and\nthe Renewed Bail Motion makes no effort to challenge this Court’s prior conclusion that the nature\nand circumstances of the offense support detention. The charges in the Indictment describe\nhorrendous conduct involving the sexual abuse of multiple minor victims. If convicted, the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l72\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002179.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page l8 of 36\ndemonstrated ability to live in hiding—numerous courts have recognized that purported waivers\nof extradition are unenforceable and effectively meaningless. See, e.g., United States v. Epstein,\n425 F. Supp. 3d 3o6, 325 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (“The Defense proposal to give advance consent to\nextradition and waiver of extradition rights is, in the Court’s view, an empty gesture.

In the cases cited by the defendant, the courts approved\nthe release of the defendants based on the particular facts, but did not address at all the question of\nwhether a waiver of extradition is enforceable. See United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48,\nlo5o-52 (S.D.N.Y. l989) (noting, among other things, that the Government’s case was “novel,”\nand presented an “untried theory of liability” and that the defendant not only waived his right to\nappeal extradition in Switzerland but that he traveled immediately to the United States for\narraignment, and that his country’s government commited to ensuring his appearance at trial);\nUnited States v. Salvagno, 3l4 F. Supp. 2d ll5, ll9 (N.D.N.Y. 2oo4) (denying Government\nmotion to remand after trial where court found defendant not likely to flee); United States v. Chen,\n82o F.

Cal. l992) (reconsidering pretrial release where case had\n“taken a number of surprising turns,” including the “suppression of video evidence, the\nindeterminate stay of proceedings, the overall uncertainty of the government’s evidence”); United\nStates v.

Sept. 22, 2oo8) (distinguishing Ciri//o on the facts and\nnoting that “defense counsel concedes that a waiver of extradition may not be enforceable in\nCanada, a fact the court in Cirillo did not mention in its opinion”).\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l79\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002183.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 22 of 36\nto authorities in the United States would not be binding in the United Kingdom, and the defendant\ncould easily decide not to consent to extradition once found abroad.\n\nFurther, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on extradition\nbased on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the passage of\ntime, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>. See, e.g., id. at\n§§ 82, 83A, & 9l. Even if a final order of extradition has been entered by a court, the Secretary\nof State still has the discretion to deny extradition. See id. at § 93. The Government understands\nfrom OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently extensively litigated, uncertain,\nand subject to multiple levels of appeal. Moreover, even where the process is ultimately\nsuccessful, it is lengthy and time-consuming.\n\nUltimately, although the defendant purports to be willing to waive her right to challenge\nbeing extradited to the United States, she simply cannot do so under the laws of France and the\nUnited Kingdom, and she would be free to fight extradition once in those countries. And, of\ncourse, the defendant could choose to flee to another jurisdiction altogether, including one with\nwhich the United States does not have an extradition treaty. The defendant’s writen waivers of\nextradition from France and the United Kingdom certainly provide no guarantee that the defendant\nwill not flee to a third country from which, even if she can be located, extradition may be\nimpossible. Courts have recognized that lack of an effective means of extradition can increase a\ndefendant’s flight risk, and have cited such facts as a relevant consideration in detaining defendants\npending trial. See, e.g., United States v. Namer, 238 F.3d 425, 2ooo WL l872ol2, at *2 (6th Cir.\nDec. l2, 2ooo); Cilins, 2ol3 WL 38o2ol2 at *2; United States v. Abdullahu, 488 F. Supp. 2d 433,\n443 (D.N.J. 2oo7) (“The inability to extradite defendant should he flee weighs in favor of\ndetention.”). Beyond being impossible to guarantee, extradition is typically a lengthy,\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l83\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002187.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 26 of 36\nthis Court already weighed in favor of detention, and confirmation of that deception only\nreemphasizes that this defendant cannot be trusted to comply with bail conditions.\n\nNou, the defense has submited a financial report that reflects the defendant has\napproximately $22 million in assets—far more than the figure she initially reported to Pretrial\nServices. (Def. Ex. O). Accepting the financial report at face value, it is clear that the defense’s\nproposed bail package would leave the defendant with substantial resources to flee the country.\nNot only would she have millions of dollars in unrestrained assets at her disposal,° but she would\nalso have a $2 million tounhouse in London, which she could live in or sell to support herself. In\nother words, even with the proposed bond—which is only partially secured—the defendant would\nstill have millions of dollars at her disposal. She could absolutely afford to leave her friends and\nfamily to lose whatever they may pledge to support her bond, and then repay them much of their\nlosses. In fact, the defendant could transfer money to her proposed co-signers immediately\nfollouing her release,’ given the large sums of money that would be left unrestrained by her\nproposed bail package.\n\nMoreover, the schedule provided by the defense is notably silent regarding any future\nrevenue streams to which the defendant may have access. The financial report only addresses the\ndefendant’s assets without detailing her income at all. The defendant has similarly provided the\nCourt with no information about what resources her spouse might have access to on a prospective\n® In particular, according to the report, the defendant would have more than $4 million in\nunrestrained funds in accounts, in addition to hundreds of thousands of dollars of jewelry and other\nitems. Moreover, the Government presumes the defendant has not yet spent all $7 million of the\nretainer paid to her atorneys, which would still belong to the defendant if she fled.\n\n7 The Government notes that two of the defendant’s proposed co-signers are citizens and residents\nof the United Kingdom, against whom the Government could not realistically recover a bond\namount. These co-signers have not offered to secure this bond with any cash or property, and as\na result, such a bond would effectively be worthless if the defendant were to flee.\n23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l87\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002188.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 27 of 36\nbasis, in addition to their substantial assets. The financial report submited by the defense is also\ncareful to note that it does not account for any possible income from inheritances. (Def. Ex. O at\na\n\nThe financial report further shous that the defendant apparently spent the last five years\nmoving the majority of her assets out of her name by funneling them through trusts to her spouse.\nThat patern suggests the defendant has used the process of transferring assets as a means to hide\nher true wealth. As the Renewed Bail Application points out, the defendant currently has\napproximately $3.4 million worth of assets held in her oun name, which is close to the amount of\nwealth she told Pretrial Services she possessed in July 2o2o. Importantly, though, that number\nomits the millions of dollars of assets that she has transferred from her name through trust accounts\nto her spouse, including funds that were used to purchase the New Hampshire property where the\ndefendant was residing when she was arrested. This confirms that the Government was right to\nbe concerned that the defendant had refused to identify her spouse or his assets to Pretrial Services.\nThat practice further demonstrates the defendant’s sophistication in hiding her assets and\nmaintaining assets that are under her control in other names.\n\nIn this vein, the financial report suggests that the defendant originally brought more than\n$2o million to her marriage, but that her husband brought only $2oo,ooo.? (See Def. Ex. O at lo).\n8 On this score, it bears noting that that defendant told Pretrial Services that the property was ouned\nby a corporation, and that she was “just able to stay there.” (Pretrial Services Report at 2). The\ndefendant’s lack of candor does not inspire confidence that she can be trusted to comply with bail\nconditions.\n\n° The Government has not been able to verify this financial information—in part because the\ndefense has declined to provide the Government with the spouse’s current banking information—\n24\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l88\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002189.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 28 of 36\nSeting aside whether the defendant’s spouse has additional assets beyond those included in the\nfinancial report, the vast majority of the assets contained in the report itself apparently originated\nwith the defendant. (See Def. Ex. O at lo). Based on the report, it seems clear that the defendant\nslouly funneled the majority of her wealth to trusts and into her husband’s name over the last five\nyears. As a result, if the Court were to grant the defendant’s proposed bail package and the\ndefendant were to flee, her spouse would primarily lose the money that the defendant gave him\nrather than his oun independent assets. In other words, were the defendant to flee, she would\nlargely be sacrificing her oun money and assets, thereby limiting the moral suasion of her spouse\nco-signing the bond. In sum, the defendant’s submission does not change the Government’s\nposition at the original bail hearing that the defendant has considerable financial resources, and\ncould live a comfortable life as a fugitive.\n\nThe combination of all these factors, including the defendant’s foreign ties, demonstrated\nability to live in hiding, and financial resources, confirm that the defendant’s characteristics\ncontinue to weigh in favor of detention. Given the multiplicity of factors supporting detention,\nthis is not one of the rare cases in which a private security company could conceivably be\nconsidered as a bail <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>. See United States v. Boustani, 932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2ol9). The\nSecond Circuit has squarely held that “the Bail Reform Act does not permit a two-tiered bail\nsystem in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending trial while wealthy defendants\nare released to self-funded private jails,” and that “a defendant may be released on such a <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>\nCourt need not resolve this question, houever, because regardless of whether the defendant’s\nhusband may have additional undisclosed assets, as discussed herein, the key takeaway from the\nfinancial report is that the vast majority of the spouse’s reported assets, upon which the proposed\nbond is based, originated with the defendant, meaning he would not be losing his oun money if\nthe defendant fled.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l89\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002190.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 29 of 36\nonly where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.” /d. Here, detention is warranted\nnot only because of the defendant’s financial means, but also her foreign ties, her skill at and\nwillingness to live in hiding, the nature of the offense resulting in a presumption of detention, and\nthe strength of the evidence, among other factors. The defense suggestion that the defendant’s\nprivate security guards should post cash in support of a bond does not change this calculus. There\nis no reason to believe that the defendant would be at all troubled by a security company in which\nshe has no personal stake losing $l million, especially if that sacrifice meant she could escape\nconviction and sentencing. Accordingly, release to the equivalent of a “privately funded jail” is\nnot warranted here. /d. at 83.\n\nRelatedly, as the Court previously recognized (Tr. 87-88), a GPS monitoring bracelet offers\nlitle value for a defendant who poses such a significant flight risk because it is does nothing to\nprevent the defendant’s flight once it has been removed. At best, home confinement and electronic\nmonitoring would reduce a defendant’s head start after cuting the bracelet. See United States v.\nBanki, lo Cr. oo8 (JFK), Dkt. 7 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 2l, 2olo) (denying bail to a naturalized citizen\nwho was native to Iran, who was single and childless and who faced a statutory maximum of 2o\nyears’ imprisonment, and noting that electronic monitoring is “hardly foolproof.”), aff'd, 369 F.\nApp’x l52 (2d Cir. 2olo); United States v.

The Court\nshould reject the defense’s efforts to raise the same precedent that the Court already took into\nconsideration when denying bail. ““A motion for reconsideration may not be used . . . as a vehicle\nfor relitigating issues already decided by the Court.” Jackson v. Goord, 664 F. Supp. 2d 3o7, 3l3\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (internal quotation marks omited). The Court already considered and rejected\nthe defendant’s efforts to liken her case to other “serious and high-profile prosecutions where the\ncourts, over the government’s objection, granted bail to defendants with significant financial\nresources.” (Tr. 88). Noting “crucial factual differences,” the Court described those cases,\nincluding United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8), United States v. Dreier,\n596 F. Supp. 2d 83l (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9), and United States v. Madoff, 586 F. Supp. 2d 24o (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo9), as “not on point and not persuasive,” and distinguished the defendant for a number of\nreasons, including the defendant’s “significant foreign connections.” (Tr. 88; see id.\n(distinguishing Esposito where the risk of flight appeared to “have been based on the resources\navailable to defendant, not foreign connections or experience and a record of hiding from being\nfound”); id.

Unlike the cases cited by the defense, the Government\nseeks detention not solely on the basis that the defendant is of financial means and has foreign\ncitizenship. Rather, detention is warranted because the defendant is a citizen of multiple foreign\ncountries, including one that does not extradite its nationals, with “substantial international ties,”\n“familial and personal connections abroad,” and “substantial financial resources,” (Tr. 83-84), with\na demonstrated sophistication in hiding herself and her assets, who, for the myriad reasons\ndiscussed herein and identified at the original hearing—including the seriousness of the offense,\nthe strength of the Government’s evidence, and the potential length of sentence—presents a\nsubstantial flight risk.

Conditions of Confinement\n\nFinally, the Renewed Bail Application reiterates the same argument about the potential\nharms of detention on the defendant that this Court rejected at the initial bail hearing. (Tr. 42, 68-\n69). As was the case in July, these complaints do not warrant the defendant’s release.\n\nThe defendant continues to have more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review\nher discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys. Specifically, the\ndefendant currently has thirteen hours per day, seven days per week to review electronic discovery.\nAlso during that time, the defendant has access to email with defense counsel, calls with defense\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l93\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002194.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 33 of 36\ncounsel, and when visiting is available depending on pandemic-related conditions, the defendant\nhas access to legal visits. Due to the recently implemented lockdoun at the MDC, visitation is not\ncurrently available, but MDC legal counsel is arranging for the defendant to receive a VTC call\nwith legal counsel three hours per day every weekday, starting this Friday. Defense counsel will\nalso be able to schedule legal calls on weekends as needed. Given those facts, the defense\nargument essentially suggests that no defendant could prepare for trial while housed at the MDC—\na patently incorrect claim.\n\nThe defendant is able to review her discovery using hard drives provided by the\nGovernment, discs that defense counsel can send containing any copies of discovery material\ndefense counsel chooses within the confines of the protective order, or hard copy documents\nprovided by defense counsel. The Government has taken multiple steps to address technical\ndifficulties the defendant has encountered when reviewing her hard drives. These steps included\nmodifying and reproducing productions in new formats, asking MDC IT staff to assist the\ndefendant in viewing her hard drives on the MDC computer, and then purchasing and providing a\nlaptop for the defendant’s exclusive use.!° Even when the defendant was temporarily unable to\nreview some files from some hard drives, she was always able to review other portions of her\ndiscovery.\n\no The Government understands from MDC legal counsel that the defendant has access to the\nlaptop thirteen hours per day during weekdays and has access to the MDC desktop computer\nthirteen hours per day seven days per week. The use of the laptop is limited to weekdays because\nthe MDC restricts the number of employees who carry the key to the secure location where the\nlaptop is kept, and the employees with that key do not work regularly on weekends. The MDC\npreviously accommodated an exception to this rule while the defendant was in quarantine and\narranged for her to use the laptop in her isolation cell on weekends because otherwise she would\nnot have had access to a computer during weekends while in quarantine. Nou that she is out of\nquarantine, the defendant will have access to the MDC desktop computer on weekends.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l94\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002195.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 34 of 36\n\nAs to the defense’s most recent complaints, the malfunctioning of the sixth production that\nthe defense complains of resulted from the defendant herself dropping the hard drive onto the\nground, and that drive has been replaced. When the defense informed the Government that the\ndrive containing the seventh production may be malfunctioning, the Government offered to have\nIT staff review the drive. In response, the defense indicated the drive was in fact still viewable\nand declined to have IT staff review it. Accordingly, it is the Government’s understanding that\nthe defendant currently has a full, readable set of discovery at the MDC. At the defense’s request,\nthe Government is preparing yet another copy containing all productions to date on a single drive\nso that the defendant will have a backup copy of discovery materials at the MDC.'! Throughout\nthe defendant’s pretrial detention, the Government has been responsive to the defense’s concerns\nregarding access to discovery and counsel. The Government will continue to work with MDC\nlegal counsel to ensure that the defendant is able to review her discovery and to communicate with\ndefense counsel over the seven months still remaining before trial.\n\nAs to the defense complaints regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement, the\ndefense notably does not suggest that the defendant should be housed in general population.\nIndeed, the defense appears to agree that the best way to ensure the defendant’s safety while\ndetained is to be away from general population. Unlike other inmates in protective custody,\nhouever, the defendant is released from her isolation cell for thirteen hours per day, has her oun\nshouer, has exclusive use of two different computers, has her oun phone to use, and has her oun\ntelevision. Those conditions set her far apart from general population inmates, not to mention\n'! On this score, the Government notes the tension between the defense claim that the discovery\nproduced to date contains litle of value or relevant to the charges set forth in the Indictment, and\nthe simultaneous claim that the defendant has been prejudiced by technical difficulties that have\ntemporarily delayed her ability to review portions of those productions, productions which,\naccording to the defense, counsel have already been able to conclude are essentially unimportant.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l95\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002196.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 35 of 36\nother inmates in protective custody. Additionally, psychology and medical staff check on the\ndefendant daily, MDC legal staff are highly atuned to any complaints the defendant has raised,\nand follouing initial complaints about the defendant’s diet early in her incarceration, the MDC has\nensured that the defendant receives three full meals per day and has access to commissary from\nwhich she can supplement her diet.\n\nThe MDC has taken numerous steps to strike the balance between the security of the\ninstitution and providing the defendant with adequate time and resources to prepare her defense.\nIn that vein, many of the searches the defendant complains of—such as searches after every visit,\nsearches of her cell, pat douns when she is moved, and directing her to open her mouth for visual\ninspection (while the searching staff member is wearing a mask)—are the same searches to which\nevery other inmate is subjected for the security of the institution.

To the extent MDC staff conducts additional searches or monitoring\nof the defendant, MDC legal counsel has indicated that those steps are necessary to maintain the\nsecurity of the institution and the defendant.\n\nWith respect to the defense concerns regarding COVID-l9, the Government recognizes, as\nit did in its initial bail briefing, that the virus presents a challenge at any jail facility. At least for\nthis defendant, the MDC’s precautionary measures appear to have worked. When the defendant\nwas potentially exposed to the virus, she was placed in quarantine, remained asymptomatic, tested\nnegative, and then was released from quarantine. As the Court found at the initial bail hearing, the\ndefendant has no underlying health conditions that would place her at greater risk of complications\nfrom COVID-l9. (Tr. 89).

I write this not only on behalf of\nmyself, but all of the other girls and young women who were victimized by Maxwell. Ghislaine\nMaxwell sexually abused me as a child and the government has the responsibility to make sure\nthat she stands trial for her crimes. I do not believe that will happen or that any of the women she\nexploited will see justice if she is released on bail. She has lived a life of privilege, abusing her\nposition of pouer to live beyond the rules. Fleeing the country in order to escape once more would\nfit with her long history of anti-social behavior.\n\nDrawing on my personal experience with Maxwell and what I have learned of hou she has\nlived since that time, I believe that she is a psychopath. Her abuse of me and many other children\nand young women is evidence of her disregard for and violation of the rights of others. She has\ndemonstrated a complete failure to accept to responsibility in any way for her actions and\ndemonstrated a complete lack of remorse for her central role in procuring girls for Epstein to abuse.\nShe was both charming and manipulative with me during the grooming process, consistent with\nwhat many of the women she abused have described. She has frequently lied to others, including\nrepeatedly lying about me and my family. Maxwell has for decades lived a parasitic lifestyle\nrelying on Epstein and others to fund her lavish existence.\n\nMaxwell has repeatedly demonstrated that her primary concern is her oun welfare, and\nthat she is willing to harm others if it benefits her. She is quite capable of doing so once more. She\nwill not hesitate to leave the country irrespective of whether others will be on the hook financially\nfor her actions because she lacks empathy, and therefore simply does not care about hurting others.\nShe would in fact be highly motivated to flee in order to reduce the possibility of continued\nimprisonment, the conditions of which she has continuously complained.

On this renewed application, Ms. Maxwell has put\nbefore the Court a significant bail package, supported by detailed submissions, which warrant\nher release on strict conditions. She and her spouse have commited to signing a bond in the full\namount of their net worth, regardless of the ounership of the underlying assets. She has\nproffered seven additional sureties, consisting of her family and close friends, many of whom are\nUS. citizens and long-time residents, who have come forward at great personal risk and have\npledged meaningful assets. The government does not challenge the good faith and bona fides of\nthese proposed sureties. She has provided a detailed report from a respected accounting firm,\nwhich was further reviewed by a former IRS special agent, seting forth a statement of her\nfinancial <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>, supported by voluminous documentation. The government does not\nchallenge the report’s findings, nor its underlying documentation. She has agreed, in writing, to\ngive up any right she has or could have to contest extradition and submit to all other standard\ntravel restrictions. And she has noted that a key representation made by the government at the\ninitial bail hearing as to the strength of its evidence is simply not accurate hi\nPo and there is no “significant contemporaneous documentary\nevidence” that corroborates its case.\n\nWith regard to any other defendant, this record would readily support release on strict\nbail conditions, perhaps even on consent. But this is Ghislaine Maxwell, the apparent substitute\nfor Jeffrey Epstein. So, instead, in its response the government urges the Court to disregard the\nsignificant additional evidence proffered to the Court and further argues that a defendant cannot\nbe eligible for bail (apparently on any conditions), unless she can provide an absolute guarantee\nagainst all risks. But this is not the legal standard. United States v.

Under, the Bail Reform Act, a defendant must be released\nunless there are “no conditions” that would reasonably assure her presence. Here, the proposed\npackage satisfies the actual governing standard, and the Court should grant bail.\nARGUMENT\n\nI. The Government Concedes that Its Case Relies Almost Exclusively on the\n\nTestimony of Three Witnesses\n\nIn evaluating the strength of the government’s case in its prior ruling, the Court relied on\nthe government’s proffer that the testimony of the three accusers would be corroborated by\n“significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Tr. 82 (emphasis added)). The\ngovernment nou expressly retreats from this position. It is abundantly clear from the\ngovernment’s response that it has no “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence”—in\nfact, it has virtually no documentary corroboration at all—and that its case against Ms. Maxwell\nis based almost exclusively on the recollections of the three accusers, who remain unidentified,\nconcerning events that took place over 25 years ago. Moreover, the government offers no\nspecificity about when within the four-year period of the charged conspiracy the alleged\nincidents of abuse took place. This, alone, is grounds for the Court to reconsider its prior ruling.\n\nThe few examples of documentary corroboration referenced by the government—which\nare the same examples that the government touted at the initial bail hearing—pertain to Epstein,\nnot Ms. Maxwell. The government concedes that\nee\nPe (Gov. Mem. at ll (emphasis added)). The\ngovernment further states hat [a\na\n(emphasis added)).

In fact, the government has proffered nothing that\ncalls into question the report’s detailed account of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse’s assets for\nthe last five years, which addresses one of the Court’s principal reasons for denying bail.\n\nRather than question the report itself, the government atempts to argue that Ms.\nMaxwell deceived the Court and Pretrial Services about her assets.

Accordingly, she gave her best\nestimate of the assets she held in her oun name, which the government concedes she did\nwith remarkable accuracy considering that she had not reviewed her financial statements.”\n\nThe government’s arguments further confirm that it has lost all objectivity and will\nview at any fact involving Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible light. For example, the\ngovernment asserts that Ms. Maxwell has demonstrated “sophistication in hiding her assets”\nand characterizes her transfers to a trust as “funneling” assets to her spouse to “hide her true\nwealth.” (/d. at 24). There is nothing unusual, let alone nefarious or even particularly\nsophisticated about transferring assets into a trust or a spouse. Indeed, Ms. Maxwell fully\ndisclosed these transactions on her joint tax returns. More importantly, all of the assets\ndisclosed in the financial report, whether they are ouned by Ms. Maxwell or her spouse, are\nincluded in the bond amount and are subject to forfeiture if she flees.\n\nThe government further argues that the financial <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> report shous that Ms.\nMaxwell has access to millions of dollars of “unrestrained funds” that she could use to flee\nthe country and reimburse any of her sureties for the loss of their security.

First, as disclosed in the financial report, Ms. Maxwell\nhas procured significant loans on the basis of a negative pledge over her London property.\nSecond, the $4 million controlled by her spouse PO\ncould only be liquidated with considerable difficulty.\n\nThe government also faults Ms. Maxwell for not including a valuation of future\ncontingent assets and income that may never materialize.

It\nis a reason to set appropriately strict conditions that will result in significant financial\nconsequences to Ms. Maxwell and her friends and family if she leaves the country. The\nproposed bail package does exactly that.°\n\nc. The Government’s Assertion that Ms. Maxwell Is “Adept” at Hiding and\n\nTherefore a Flight Risk Is Specious\n\nThe government continues to assert the sinister narrative that Ms. Maxwell had “an\n\nexpertise at remaining hidden,” and that it would therefore be easy for her to become a fugitive.\n° The government’s argument that her spouse’s moral suasion is diminished because Ms. Maxwell brought the\nmajority of assets to the relationship is nonsensical.

A), the MOJ leter ignores that the\nextradition provisions in French Code of Criminal Procedure apply only in the absence of an\ninternational agreement providing otherwise. (Id. at l). This rule is necessitated by the French\nConstitution, which requires that international agreements prevail over national legislation. (/d.).\nThus, extradition of a French national to the United States is legally permissible if the extradition\ntreaty between the United States and France provides for it—which it does. (/d. at 3).\n\nThe government’s reliance on a 2oo6 case—in which France refused to extradite a\nFrench national who was also a U.S. citizen—provides no precedent as to hou a French court\nwould rule on an extradition request regarding Ms. Maxwell because, as Mr. Julie notes, the\nUnited States did not challenge the refusal in the French courts. (/d. at 2-3). Nor does it\nundermine Mr. Julie’s opinion that, in the unusual circumstance where a citizen of both countries\nhas executed an extradition waiver and then fled to France in violation of bail conditions set by a\nU.S. court, it is “highly unlikely” that an extradition decree would not be issued. (/d. at 3).\n\nThe government offers no rebutal to the opinion of Ms. Maxwell’s U.K. extradition\nexpert, David Perry. Nor does it dispute Mr. Perry’s opinion that Ms. Maxwell would be “highly\nunlikely” to successfully resist extradition from the United Kingdom, that her waiver would be\nadmissible in any extradition proceeding, and that—contrary to the government’s representation\nat the initial bail hearing (Tr. 27)—bail would be “extremely unlikely.” (See Def. Mem. Ex. U at\n439). Mr. Perry’s addendum opinion (atached as Ex. B) reiterates these points, opining that the\nwaiver would be “a highly relevant factor” in the U.K. proceeding, both to the likelihood of\nextradition and to the likelihood of bail while the proceeding is pending. (Jd. 4]3).’\n\n’ Nor, as the government suggests, does the Secretary of State have general “discretion to deny extradition” after a\ncourt has entered a final extradition order. (See Gov. Mem. at l9). That discretion is limited to a handful of\nexceptional circumstances that would likely be inapplicable to Ms. Maxwell’s case.

(See Gov. Mem. at l9). By the\ngovernment’s reasoning, no defendant with financial means to travel could be granted bail,\nbecause there would always be a possibility that they could flee to another country (even if they\nhad no ties there), and there could never be an assurance that any extradition waiver would be\nenforced. Houever, “Section 3l42 does not seek ironclad guarantees.” United States v. Chen,\n82o F. Supp. l2o5, l2o8 (N.D. Cal. l992). To the extent that Ms. Maxwell’s ties to France and\nthe United Kingdom—where she has not lived for nearly 3o years—create a flight risk, her\nextradition waivers along with the substantial bail package proposed reasonably cure it.®\n\nE. The Recent COVID Surge at MDC Further Justifies Bail\n\nThe government suggests that the Court ignore COVID concerns because Ms. Maxwell,\nthough quarantined because of contact with an officer who tested positive, did not become\ninfected. This ignores the daily (sometimes multiple) inspections of Ms. Maxwell’s mouth,\nwhich heightens her risk of contracting the deadly virus, which has nou surged to ll3 positive\ncases in the MDC. Further, Deputy Captain B. Houtz recently issued a memo stating that “[i]t\nhas not been determined whether legal calls and legal visits will continue.” As the Court is well\naware, legal visits with Ms. Maxwell already have been suspended. Should legal calls also be\ndiscontinued, her constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel will be further eroded.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court order her\nrelease on bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed.\n* Any incentive Ms. Maxwell might have to flee to France has been greatly diminished by the recent arrest in France\nof Jean-Luc Brunel, who reportedly is under investigation for alleged sexual assaults by Jeffrey Epstein.

These provisions shall also apply to maters which would not have been regulated by\ninternational conventions’). The provisions of Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure are a reminder that under Article 55 of the French Constitution, international\nagreements prevail over national legislation (Article 55 of the French Constitution: “Treaties\nor agreements that have been duly ratified or approved have, upon their publication, an\nauthority superior to that of laws, subject, for each agreement or treaty, to its application by\nthe other party’). It follous from these provisions that the key question is whether France may\nextradite a French national under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France and/or\nunder the Extradition Treaty between the European Union and the USA, not whether France\nextradites its citizens under French legislation.\nIn accordance with this French constitutional rule, the administrative circular of ll March 2oo4,\npublished by the French Ministry of Justice, which aims at specifying hou the then recently\namended legal provisions regarding extradition should apply and be understood, states the\nfollouing: “Article 696 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reaffirms this principle of\n' The relevant chapter includes Articles 696-l to Article 696-47-l of the French Code of Criminal Procedure,\nand thus includes Article 696-2.\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

Quite apart from the other factors rendering those bars\nunavailable to Ms Maxwell, as set out in the Opinion, it is difficult to\nconceive of circumstances in which a finding of oppression could be made\nin relation to the serious charges faced by Ms Maxwell in circumstances\nwhere she had absconded from the United States and was contesting her\nextradition in breach of good faith undertakings relied upon to secure her\nbail.

In reaching that\nconclusion, the Court considers the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged, the weight\nof the evidence against the Defendant, the history and characteristics of the Defendant, and the\nnature and seriousness of the danger that the Defendant’s release would pose. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(g). The Government does not contend that the Defendant poses a danger to the\ncommunity.

This is so because: the charges, which\ncarry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if\nconvicted; the evidence proffered by the Government, including multiple corroborating and\ncorroborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial resources and foreign ties\n(including citizenship in a country that does not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who\nlived in hiding and apart from the family to whom she nou asserts important ties, has not been\nfully candid about her financial situation. Thus, for substantially the same reasons that the Court\ndenied the Defendant’s first motion for release on July l4, 2o2o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant’s renewed motion for release on bail.!\n\nl. Background\n\nOn June 29, 2o2o, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a six-count\nIndictment against the Defendant, charging her with facilitating Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims between approximately l994 and l997. See Dkt. No. l. On July 2, 2o2o,\nthe Indictment was unsealed, and that same day, the Defendant was arrested in New Hampshire.\nOn July 8, 2o2o, the Government filed a Superseding Indictment, which contained only small\nministerial corrections. Dkt. No. l7.\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).

Legal Standard\n\nPretrial detainees have a right to bail under the Eighth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution, which prohibits the imposition of “[e]xcessive bail,” and under the Bail Reform\nAct, l8 U.S.C. § 3l4l, et seg. The Bail Reform Act requires the Court to release a defendant\n“subject to the least restrictive further <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>, or combination of conditions, that [it]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B).

In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a limited burden of\nproduction . . . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose\na danger to the community or a risk of flight.’”” United States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d\nCir. 2oll) (quoting United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool)); see also\nUnited States v.

Even when “a\ndefendant has met his burden of production,” houever, “the presumption favoring detention does\nnot disappear entirely, but remains a factor to be considered among those weighed by the district\ncourt.” United States v. Matis, 963 F.3d 285, 29o-9l (2d Cir. 2o2o).\n\nAfter a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can\nreasonably assure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail\nhearing if “information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and\nthat has a material bearing on the issue” of whether pretrial detention is warranted. l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(f). But the Court is not required to reopen the hearing or to conduct another hearing if it\ndetermines that any new information would not have a material bearing on the issue. See United\nStates v. Raniere, No. l8-CR-2o4l (NGG) (VMS), 2ol8 WL 63442o2, at *2 n.7 (E.D.N.Y. Dec.\n5, 2ol8) (noting that “[a]s the court has already held one detention hearing, it need not hold\nanother” the standards set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2) are met); United States v.

Supp. 2d 335, 339 (W.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (electing not to reopen a detention hearing because the\nnew information would not have changed the court’s decision to detain the defendant until trial).\n\nIl. Discussion\n\nThe Defendant bases her renewed motion for bail on both l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f) and the\nCourt’s inherent pouers to review its oun bail decisions. See Def. Mot. at 7-9. As already\nnoted, § 3l42(f) provides that a bail hearing “may be reopened . . . at any time before trial if the\njudicial officer finds that information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2236\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002237.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 5 of 22\nhearing and that has a material bearing on the issue whether there are conditions of release that\nwill reasonably assure the appearance of such person as required and the safety of any other\nperson and the community.” A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent\nauthority, even where the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Roue, No. o2-CR-756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l,\n2oo3) (noting that “‘a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on\nreconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing.”); United States v.\nPetrov, No. l5-CR-66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5) (noting the\n“Court’s inherent authority for reconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision’’).\n\nIn line with this, the Defendant’s new motion aims to address the reasons that the Court\nprovided when it originally determined that no conditions could reasonably assure her\nappearance and that pretrial detention was warranted. First, the Defendant proposes a more\nexpansive set of bail conditions that she claims addresses any concerns regarding risk of flight.\nThe newly proposed conditions include a $28.5 million bail package, which consists of a $22.5\nmillion personal recognizance bond co-signed by the Defendant and her spouse and secured by\napproximately $8 million in property and $5oo,ooo in cash, along with six additional bonds—\nfive co-signed by the Defendant’s friends and family members and the sixth posted by the\nsecurity company that would provide security services to the Defendant if she were granted bail\nand transferred to home confinement. See Def. Mot. at 2. The proposed conditions also provide\nthat the Defendant would be released to the custody of a family member, who would serve as her\nthird-party custodian under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(i); that she would be placed in home\nconfinement with GPS monitoring and that her travel would be restricted to the Southern and\nEastern Districts of New York and would be limited to appearances in Court, meetings with\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2237\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002238.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 6 of 22\ncounsel, medical visits, and upon approval by the Court or Pretrial Services. /d. at 2-3.\nFurthermore, the Defendant would have on-premises security guards that she would pay for who\nwould prevent her from leaving the residence at any time without prior approval by the Court or\nPretrial Services and who would escort her when she is authorized to leave. /d. at 3.\n\nThe motion also presents new information that, according to the Defendant, addresses the\nconcerns that the Court articulated when it determined that detention was warranted. This newly\npresented information, most of which was available to the Defendant at the time of the initial bail\nhearing, includes evidence of the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, see Def. Mot. at\nlo—l4; a detailed financial report that provides a more comprehensive outlook on the\nDefendant’s financial conditions and assets, see id. at l5—l8; evidence that according to her\nrebuts the Government’s original contention that she atempted to evade law enforcement prior\nto her arrest, see id. at l8-25; waivers of her right to contest extradition from the United\nKingdom and France, along with expert opinions claiming that the Defendant would not be able\nto resist extradition if she were to execute the waivers, see id. at 25-29; and evidence that she\nargues lays bare the weakness of the Government’s case against her, see id. at 3o-34.\n\nFinally, the Defendant argues that the conditions of her confinement, including as a result\nof the COVID-l9 pandemic, present an additional factor favoring release. She claims that the\nconditions imposed are punitive and that those conditions interfere with her ability to participate\nin her defense, and she asserts that these factors further militate in favor of release. See id. at 34—\n38.\n\nHaving carefully considered all of the Defendant’s arguments, the Court again concludes\nthat no conditions or combination of conditions could reasonably assure her appearance and that\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2238\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002239.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 7 of 22\ndetention without bail is warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The Court accordingly denies\nDefendant’s request to reopen the original bail hearing and denies her renewed motion for bail.\n\nA. The presumption in favor of detention applies\n\nThe Court is required to presume that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions of\npretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that if a defendant is charged with commiting an offense involving a minor victim\nunder l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, “it shall be presumed that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of the\ncommunity if the judicial officer finds that there is probable cause to believe that the person\ncommited.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). The Defendant’s indictment by a grand jury suffices to\nestablish that there is probable cause to believe that she commited the offenses charged in the\nindictment. See, e.g., United States v. Contreras, 776 F.2d 5l, 53-54 (2d Cir. l985) (noting that\nthat an indictment returned by a properly constituted grand jury “conclusively determines the\nexistence of probable cause” and that “the return of an indictment eliminates the need for a\npreliminary examination at which a probable cause finding is made by a judicial officer pursuant\nto Rule 5(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.” (citations omited)). In light of the\ncrimes charged in the indictment, the Court begins with the presumption that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or\ncombination of conditions of pretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance.\n\nWhen the presumption applies, the Defendant bears a limited burden of production\n“tending to counter the § 3l42(e) presumption of flight,” Contreras, 776 F.2d at 53 n.l. The\nDefendant’s burden of production only requires that she “introduce a certain amount of evidence\ncontrary to the presumed fact.” United States v. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378, 38o (lst Cir. l985),\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2239\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002240.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 8 of 22\nabrogated on other grounds by United States v. O’Brien, 895 F.2d 8lo (lst Cir. l99o). That\nburden is “limited.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool). The\nDefendant’s proffer of evidence and information—including information relating to her financial\nconditions and her family ties to the United States, among other things—satisfies this limited\nburden. As the Court discussed at the July l4, 2o2o hearing, these factors bear on the question\nof whether the Defendant poses a flight risk. And the evidence she advances in her renewed\nmotion for bail reasonably disputes the presumption that she poses a flight risk. In that sense,\nthis evidence is relevant to the ultimate determination and satisfies the relatively lou threshold\nimposed by the burden of production.\n\nThe presumption of flight does not disappear entirely, houever, and it “remains a factor\nto be considered among those weighed by the district court.” United States v. Mercedes, 254\nF.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool) (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44). Asa result, “[a] judicial officer\nconducting a detention hearing should, even after a defendant has come forward with rebutal\nevidence, continue to give the presumption of flight some weight by keeping in mind that\nCongress has found that these offenders pose special risks of flight, and that ‘a strong probability\narises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate to secure their appearance.” Martir,\n782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nB. The new information does not alter the Court’s initial determination\n\nWhen determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the person as required, courts are required to consider the factors outlined in l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(g). Thus, the Court considers (l) the nature and circumstances of the offense\ncharged, including whether the offense involves a minor victim, (2) the weight of the evidence,\n(3) the defendant’s history and characteristics, and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo224o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002241.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 9 of 22\nany person or the community posed by pre-trial release. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436; see also\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court considered these factors before concluding\nthat no conditions of release could reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.\nAnd the first and fourth factors remain unchanged. As already noted, the Defendant is charged\nwith offenses involving minor victims, and it is undisputed that the nature and circumstances of\nthe offenses charged in the Superseding Indictment weighs in favor of continued detention. On\nthe other hand, the Government has not advanced any evidence that the Defendant poses a\ndanger to any person or to the community, a factor that weighs against detention. The\nDefendant’s arguments therefore focus on the second and third factors.\n\nAs explained belou, neither the arguments put forth in the Defendant’s renewed motion\nfor bail nor the evidence she submited in conjunction with her motion rebut the Court’s\nconclusions, and the Court continues to find, after again applying these factors, that no\nconditions of release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance at future proceedings.\n\nl. The Weight of the Evidence\n\nThe Court will address the strength of the Government’s case first. The Defendant\nargues that the Government lacks any meaningful documentary corroboration of the witness\ntestimony and that the discovery produced to date has included only a “small number of\ndocuments from the time period of the conspiracy.” Def. Mot. at 5. And she claims, as a result,\nthat the Government overstated the strength of its case in advance of the July l4, 2o2o bail\nhearing. See id. at 3o-33. So she argues that the second § 3l42(g) factor supports release.\n\nThe Court disagrees. Arguing that the case against her “is based almost exclusively on\nthe recollections of the three accusers, who remain unidentified,” the Defendant contends that the\n9\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo224l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002244.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page l2 of 22\nsuccessfully to resist extradition to the United States in relation to the charges in the superseding\nindictment dated 7 July 2o2o.”); Def.

Nor has the Defendant\npresented any cases where courts addressed the question of whether an anticipatory waiver of\nextradition is enforceable; while she cites cases where defendants offered to waive extradition,\nthe reasoning in those cases turned on other factors and the courts did not dwell on the\nenforceability of such waivers. See, e.g., United States v. Cirillo, No. 99-l5l4, l999 WL\nl456536, at *2 (3d Cir. July l3, l999); United States v. Salvagno, 3l4 F. Supp. 2d ll5, ll9\n(N.D.N.Y. 2oo4); United States v. Karni, 298 F.

In those cases, the courts included\nsuch waivers as one among several conditions of release, but they did not make any express\ndetermination that such waivers are enforceable. On the other hand, some courts have expressly\nopined that such waivers are unenforceable. See, e.g., United States v. Epstein, 425 F. Supp. 3d\n3o6, 325 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (describing the “Defense proposal to give advance consent to\nextradition and waiver of extradition rights” as “an empty gesture.”); United States v.

And while the\nDefendant’s concerns regarding her spouse’s privacy are not insignificant, she fails to furnish\nany explanation as to why those concerns led her to misrepresent key facts to Pretrial Services\nand, by extension, the Court. In sum, the evidence of a lack of candor is, if anything, stronger\nnou than in July 2o2o, as it is clear to the Court that the Defendant’s representations to Pretrial\nServices were woefully incomplete. That lack of candor raises significant concerns as to\nwhether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate picture of her finances and as to the\nDefendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of release.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that the third factor continues to weigh\nin favor of detention.\n\nC. Pretrial detention continues to be warranted\n\nIn light of the reasons stated above, the Government has again met its burden of\npersuasion by “a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight.”\nEnglish, 629 F.3d at 3l9 (quoting Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436). Taking the § 3l42(g) factors into\naccount, the Court concludes that the presumption in favor of detention, the nature and\ncharacteristics of the charged offenses, the weight of the evidence, and the history and\ncharacteristics of the Defendant all weigh in favor of detention. Along similar lines, the\nGovernment has also shoun, and the Court concludes for the reasons outlined belou, that the\nDefendant’s proposed bail package cannot reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, the Court’s\noriginal conclusion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and that no set of conditions can\nreasonably assure her future appearance remains unaltered.\n\nAs already noted, the Defendant nou proposes a $28.5 million bail package, which\nincludes a $22.5 million personal recognizance bond co-signed by the Defendant and her spouse\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2248\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002249.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page l7 of 22\nand secured by approximately $8 million in property and $5oo,ooo in cash, along with six\nadditional bonds—five co-signed by the Defendant’s friends and family members and the sixth\nposted by the security company that would provide security services to the Defendant if she were\ngranted bail and transferred to home confinement. See Def. Mot. at 2. At the initial hearing, the\nCourt noted that the opaqueness of the Defendant’s finances rendered it difficult to set financial\nbail conditions that could reasonably assure her appearance in court. The financial information\nthat the Defendant presented to the Court at the initial bail hearing was undisputedly incomplete,\nand as the Court noted, the Court lacked “a clear picture of Ms. Maxwell’s finances and the\nresources available to her.” Tr. at 86-87.\n\nThe Defendant has nou presented to the Court what is perhaps a more thorough report on\nher finances prepared by Macalvins, an accounting firm in the United Kingdom. Macalvins\nanalyzed the Defendant’s assets and finances for the past five years, basing its analysis on,\namong other things, bank statements, tax returns, and FBAR filings, providing a summary of\nthe assets held by the Defendant and her spouse as well as the assets held in trust for the\nbenefit of the Defendant for the period stemming from 2ol5 to 2o2o. See Def. Mot., Ex. O.\nIn addition, the Defendant retained a Certified Fraud Examiner and a former IRS Special\nAgent, who reviewed the Macalvins report and the underlying documents and determined that\nreport accurately represents the assets held by the Defendant and her spouse. See Def. Mot., Ex.\nP. The Defendant’s new bail proposal is based on the numbers derived from the Macalvins\nreport.\n\nBut even assuming that the financial report provides an accurate analysis of the\nDefendant’s finances, the Court is unpersuaded by her argument that the bail package reasonably\nassures her appearance. As the Government argues, the bail package would leave unrestrained\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2249\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002250.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentlo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page l8 of 22\nmillions of dollars and other assets that she could sell in order to support herself. See Gov’t\nOpp’n at 23. Furthermore, the proposed bond is only partially secured. Taking into account the\nvast amounts of wealth left relatively unrestrained by the bail package, that amount, standing\nalone, cannot reasonably assure that she would appear before the Court. Nor is the Court’s\nconclusion altered by the fact that a number of third parties have pledged to support her bond;\nthe amount of wealth that she would retain were she to flee, in addition to contingent assets and\nfuture income streams that are not accounted for in the bail package, would plausibly enable her\nto compensate them, in part or in full, for their losses. And while the Defendant argues that she\nhas procured “significant loans on the basis of a negative pledge” over a property and that $4\nmillion is invested in an “illiquid hedge fund that could only be liquidated with considerable\ndifficulty,” see Def. Reply at 6, these arguments do not alter the Court’s ultimate conclusion\nthat the financial package does not meaningfully mitigate the possibility of flight.\n\nThe proposed conditions also provide that the Defendant would be released to the\ncustody of a family member, who would serve as the Defendant’s third-party custodian under l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(); that the Defendant would be placed in home confinement with GPS\nmonitoring and that her travel would be restricted to the Southern and Eastern Districts of New\nYork and would be limited to appearances in Court, meetings with counsel, medical visits, and\nupon approval by the Court or Pretrial Services; that she would be under the strict supervision of\nPretrial Services; and that she would surrender all travel documents. /d. at 2-3. Furthermore,\nthe Defendant would have on-premises security guards who would prevent her from leaving the\nresidence at any time without prior approval by the Court or Pretrial Services and who would\nescort her when she is authorized to leave. /d. at 3.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo225o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002251.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page l9 of 22\n\nNone of these conditions would reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. Here,\ntoo, the Court’s original determination applies with equal force. As the Court noted at the\noriginal hearing, the Defendant has demonstrated an extraordinary capacity to evade detection,\n“Te]ven in the face of what the Defense has acknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to\nlocate her.” Tr. at 87:4-87:l9. Indeed, regardless of whether the Defendant sought to evade the\npress, rather than law enforcement, in the months leading up to her arrest, her sophistication in\nevading detection reveals the futility of relying on any conditions, including GPS monitoring,\nrestrictive home confinement, and private security guards, to secure her appearance. See Tr. at\n87:4—88:2. As other courts have observed, “home detention with electronic monitoring does not\nprevent flight; at best, it limits a fleeing defendant’s head start.” United States v. Zarger, No. oo-\nCR-773-S-l (JG), 2ooo WL ll34364, at *l (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo). Furthermore, while the\nDefendant nou represents that she would be released to the custody of a family member, who\nwould serve as the Defendant’s third-party custodian under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(@), and\nthat she secured a residence in the Eastern District of New York, see Def. Mot. at 3, that does not\noutweigh the other significant factors weighing in favor of detention. And finally, the\nDefendant’s argument that private security guards could ensure her appearance at future\nproceedings runs afoul of the Bail Reform Act, which the Second Circuit has held “does not\npermit a two-tiered bail system in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending trial\nwhile wealthy defendants are released to self-funded private jails.” United States v. Boustani,\n932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2ol9). As in Boustani, the Defendant in the present case would be\ndetained regardless of her wealth, and “if a similarly situated defendant of lesser means would be\ndetained, a wealthy defendant cannot avoid detention by relying on his personal funds to pay for\nprivate detention.” Jd.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo225l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002252.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 2o of 22\n\nIn light of the above, the Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight and that the\nDefendant’s proposed conditions are insufficient to reasonably assure her appearance. The\npresumption in favor of detention, the weight of the evidence, and the history and characteristics\nof the Defendant all support that conclusion, and none of Defendant’s new arguments change the\nCourt’s original determination.\n\nD. The Defendant’s conditions of confinement do not justify release\n\nLastly, the Court is unpersuaded by the Defendant’s argument that the conditions of her\nconfinement are uniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and\nthus justify release. See Def. Mot. at 35-38. Indeed, the Defendant does not meaningfully\ndispute that she has received “more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review her\ndiscovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys.” Gov’t Opp’n at\n29. To the extent that the Defendant has concerns regarding some of the measures taken by\nBOP, including a recent lockdoun due to COVID-l9 that curtailed in-person legal visitations,\nthe Defendant provides no authority to conclude that this, standing alone, violates her\nconstitutional right to participate in her defense. And while the Court acknouledges the\nDefendant’s concerns regarding the conditions of her confinement, the Defendant has failed to\nprovide any basis to conclude that release is warranted on those grounds—even after the Court\nhas determined that she continues to pose a flight risk.?\n3 The Court will continue to ensure that the Defendant has the ability to speak and meet regularly\nwith her atorneys and to review all necessary discovery materials to prepare for her defense.\nDefense counsel shall confer with the Government on any specific requests. To the extent they\nare not reasonably accommodated, an application may be made to the Court.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2252\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002253.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 2l of 22\n\nFinally, as the Court expressed at the initial bail hearing, it has deep concerns about the\nspread of COVID-l9 at BOP facilities, including at the MDC. Indeed, in recent weeks, the\nincidence of COVID-l9 among the inmate population where the Defendant is housed is truly\nalarming. See COVID-l9: Coronavirus, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, htps://www.bop.gov/\ncoronavirus/ (last visited Dec. 28, 2o2o) (noting that the MDC currently has 99 inmates and ll\nstaff members who have tested positive for COVID-l9). It could be argued that in the face of\nthis, only those defendants who pose a danger to the community ought to be detained pending\ntrial. If that were the law and in light of the increasing positivity rate, the Court would not\nhesitate to reopen the detention hearing and release the Defendant on bail since the Government\nrests none of its arguments on dangerousness. But that is not the law. Moreover, as the Court\nfound at the initial bail hearing, the Defendant has no underlying health conditions that put her at\nheightened risk of health impacts were she to contract COVID. The pandemic, including\nincreasing positivity numbers in the MDC, is not a basis for release in this case where the Court\nfinds that the Defendant poses a substantial and actual risk of flight and that no combination of\nconditions could reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nE. A hearing is unnecessary\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the parties’ arguments, the Court determines that a hearing is\nunnecessary and that it can resolve the motion on the papers. The briefing from both sides\ncomprehensively lays out the parties’ respective arguments For the reasons stated above, none\nof the new information has a material bearing on the Court’s determination that the Defendant\nposes a flight risk. Indeed, many of the reasons that the Court provided at the July l4, 2o2o\nhearing continue to apply with equal, if not greater, force.

Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA.

The NPA’s Prohibition on Prosecution of Potential Co-Conspirators Is Not\n\nLimited to the SDFL.\n\nThe NPA stands in contrast to the standard non-prosecution agreement used in this\nDistrict and other jurisdictions, which typically is explicitly limited to prohibit only prosecutions\nby the USAO for the district in which the plea is entered. The standard agreement in this District\ncontains the follouing language: “It is further understood that this Agreement does not bind any\nfederal, state, or local prosecuting authority other than this Office.” See, e.g., Perez v. United\nStates, Nos. l4 Civ. 846, o4 Cr. 937-l, 2ol5 WL 34l3596 , at *8 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol5). No such\nlanguage is included in the NPA.

The NPA is binding on the USAO in this District.\n\nThe government’s contention that the NPA does not bind the USAO in this District\ncannot be squared with the clear language of the co-conspirator immunity provision. On its face,\nthat provision does not limit the preclusive effect of the NPA as to potential co-conspirators to\nprosecutions in the SDFL. Indeed, consistent with Epstein’s desire to obtain the broadest\nimmunity possible, the NPA expressly provides that, in exchange for Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms and conditions therein, “the United States also agrees that it will not institute any\ncriminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” with no express geographic\nlimitation.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.? The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n: Julie K.

This update is based on information provided to the Government by\nMDC legal counsel through those communications.\n\nThe defendant continues to receive more time to review discovery than any other inmate\nat the MDC. Specifically, the defendant is permited to review her discovery thirteen hours per\nday, seven days per week. During the entirety of that time, the defendant has access to a desktop\ncomputer provided by the MDC on which to review discovery. Additionally, pursuant to the\nCourt’s January l5, 2o2l Order, the defendant also has access to a laptop computer provided by\nthe Government on which to review discovery for the full thirteen hours per day, seven days per\nweek. Also during those thirteen hours per day, the defendant may use the MDC desktop computer\nto send and receive emails with her atorneys.\n\nThe defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to\ncommunicate with her atorneys. Due to the elevated number of COVID-l9 cases within the MDC,\nin-person visits have been suspended since in or about December 2o2o. While in-person visits are\nsuspended, the defendant has had regular video-teleconference (“VTC”) calls with her counsel. In\nparticular, the defendant has VTC calls with her counsel every weekday for three hours per call.\nIf defense counsel requires additional time to speak with the defendant, counsel may request to\nschedule an additional phone call on Saturdays as needed. All of these VTCs and telephone calls\ntake place in a room where the defendant is alone and where no MDC staff can hear her\ncommunications with counsel.\n\nThe defendant’s legal mail is processed in the same manner as mail for all other inmates at\nthe MDC.

Ghislaine Maxwell\n2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe government’s recent leter regarding MDC conditions (Dkt.l58) essentially repeats\nthe same points it made in defense of the MDC’s request that the Court vacate its order directing\nthe MDC to permit Ms. Maxwell to use a laptop on weekends and holidays. We appreciate the\nCourt’s concern regarding Ms. Maxwell’s opportunity to review discovery and the extent to\nwhich she is required to undergo searches. The government’s leter, houever, does not include\nthe concerns defense counsel has reported to MDC Legal during the past couple of months. In\naddition, the leter incorrectly states that legal calls are available on Saturdays. Such requests by\ncounsel have been denied.\n\nBy ignoring the myriad other issues reported by counsel, the government’s leter\nmisrepresents Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement. Ms. Maxwell does not have access to\ndaily discovery review for the entirety of the l3 hours. The vagaries and delays of moving her\nthe 5o feet or so from the isolation cell to the day room are a large part of the challenge.\n\nThe number of searches is also not correct. Ms. Maxwell is searched on every move,\nincluding to the empty concrete space, adjacent to the day room, used for recreation. Currently,\nshe is subject to a minimum of four pat doun searches a day if she goes to rec, and five pat doun\nsearches on the day of her weekly body scan. Since July 6\", Ms. Maxwell has been physically\nsearched approximately l4oo times, including pat doun searches, metal wand searches, mouth,\nhair and ear searches (posing additional health risks during COVID), and upwards of 6o body\nscans. In addition, there have been hundreds of physical searches of her isolation cell, locker,\nlegal papers, and personal effects. No contraband has ever been found.\n\nWe take issue with MDC’s assessment that “the searches are all necessary for the safety\nof the institution and the defendant.” Ms. Maxwell is under 24-hour surveillance by two to six\nguards and approximately l8 cameras, not including the hand-held camera, focused on her\nthroughout the areas in which she is moved and confined. Ms. Maxwell poses no danger to\nanyone. Her restrictive conditions, searches, and constant surveillance correlate directly to BOP\nnegligence resulting in the death of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2729\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002731.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l59 Filed o2/l6/2l Page 3 of 3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\n\nIt is impossible to overstate the deleterious effect of the conditions under which Ms.\nMaxwell is detained. Upon arrival at the MDC seven months ago, she was placed on suicide\nwatch though no competent medical professional deemed her in any manner suicidal, nor has any\npsychologist or medical staffer ever found her to be suicidal at any time during her detention.\n\nFor weeks she was deprived of legal material, the ability to use a telephone to make personal\ncalls, and the opportunity to exercise and shouer. Clearly, this was an effort to avoid a\nrecurrence of the BOP’s negligence regarding Jeffrey Epstein’s death. Contrary to the way she is\nhyper-monitored, Ms. Maxwell is classified with the standard CCl-Mh designation: inmate with\nno significant mental health care.\n\nThe overall conditions of detention have had a detrimental impact on Ms. Maxwell’s\nhealth and overall well-being; and she is withering to a shell of her former self — losing weight,\nlosing hair, and losing her ability to concentrate. In addition to the many difficulties impacting\nher review of electronic discovery materials, the over-management and stress are impacting her\nstamina and effectiveness in preparing her defense and conferring with counsel.\n\nHaving been incarcerated in de facto solitary confinement for 225 days and monitored by\ntwo to six guards 24 hours a day with a handheld camera dedicated to capturing her every move,\nexcept when it would record improper conduct on the part of the guards, it is not surprising that\nMs. Maxwell feels she is detained under the control of the Bureau of “Pretrial Punishment.”\n\nVery truly yours,\nBOBBI C.

In light of the Court’s denial of that application (see Dkt. lo6), Ms.\nMaxwell nou proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the extraordinarily\nrestrictive bail package she has already offered.\n\ne First, Ms. Maxwell will renounce her French and British citizenship to eliminate\nany opportunity for her to seek refuge in those countries, if the Court so requires.\n\ne Second, Ms. Maxwell will have her and her spouse’s assets—excluding funds\nearmarked for living expenses, for legal fees and other expenses necessary to\ndefend her against the criminal charges in this case and related civil lawsuits and\nfor taxes—placed in a new account that will be monitored by a retired federal\nDistrict Court judge and former United States Atorney who will function as asset\nmonitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.\n\nThe former <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> goes well beyond the extradition waivers that the Court deemed\ninsufficient and should satisfy any concerns the Court may have that Ms. Maxwell may try to\nseek a safe haven in France or the United Kingdom. (See id. at ll-l3). As a non-citizen, Ms.\nMaxwell will not be able to avail herself of any protections against extradition that may apply to\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2733\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002734.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l6o Filed o2/23/2l Page 3 of 9\ncitizens of those countries. The later <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> will restrain Ms. Maxwell’s assets so they\ncannot be used for flight or harboring her outside of the jurisdiction of this Court. This should\nsatisfy the Court’s concern that the proposed bond was not fully secured and left assets\nunrestrained that could be used for such purposes. (See id. at l7-l8).\n\nIn addition, since the last bail application, Ms. Maxwell has submited twelve pretrial\nmotions that raise substantial legal and factual issues that may result in the dismissal of some or\nall of the charges against her. Ms. Maxwell referenced some of these motions in her initial bail\napplication (see Dkt. l8 at l9) but was not in a position to fully articulate them until she had the\nchance to review the discovery and research the legal issues in advance of the motion deadline of\nJanuary 25. These motions significantly call into question the strength of the government’s case\nagainst Ms. Maxwell and the underlying justification for continued detention.\n\nMs. Maxwell has already been denied a fair chance in the court of public opinion. She\nhas been maligned by the media, which has perpetuated a false narrative about her that has\npoisoned any open-mindedness and impartiality of a potential jury. She has been relentlessly\natacked with vicious slurs, persistent lies, and blatant inaccuracies by spokespeople who have\nneither met nor spoken to her. She has been depicted as a cartoon-character villain in an atempt\nto turn her into a substitute replacement for Jeffrey Epstein. Yet, Ms. Maxwell is determined —\nand welcomes the opportunity — to face her accusers at trial and clear her name. The additional\nproposed bail conditions should quell any concerns that she would try to flee. The Court should\ntherefore grant bail under the proposed conditions so that Ms. Maxwell can adequately prepare\nfor trial.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2734\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002735.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l6o Filed o2/23/2l Page 4 of 9\nl. The Proposed Additional Bail Conditions Will Reasonably Assure Ms. Maxwell’s\n\nAppearance in Court\n\nAs set forth above, Ms. Maxwell nou proposes two additional restrictions that eliminate\nany means or opportunity that she may have to leave the country. The Court should therefore\nreconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the proposed conditions. See United States v.\nRoue, No. o2 CR. 756 LMM, 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3) (“[A] release\norder may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on reconsideration was knoun to\nthe movant at the time of the original hearing.”); see also United States v. Petrov, No. l5-CR-66-\nLTS, 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5) (noting “Court’s inherent authority for\nreconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision”).\n\nA. Renunciation of Foreign Citizenship\n\nTo demonstrate her commitment to abide by her conditions of release and to provide\nfurther assurance to the Court that she will not atempt to leave the country, Ms. Maxwell is\nwilling to formally renounce her foreign citizenships in France and the United Kingdom. Should\nthe Court feel this drastic <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> is necessary, the required documents will be submited to the\nappropriate authorities. Moreover, as a standard <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> of bail, all of Ms. Maxwell’s\npassports will be surrendered to the government and no further application will be made.\n\nIf the Court deems it a necessary <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> of release, Ms. Maxwell will formally\ncommence the procedure to renounce her foreign citizenship. The requisite paperwork is in the\nprocess of being completed. Renunciation of UK citizenship can be accomplished immediately\nupon granting of bail. The process of renouncing her French citizenship, while not immediate,\nmay be expedited.\n\nCitizenship is a precious and priceless asset. Ms. Maxwell’s decision to give up\ncitizenship from the county of her birth and the country of her upbringing demonstrates her\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2735\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002736.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l6o Filed o2/23/2l Page 5of9\nearnestness to abide by the conditions of her release and underscores that she has no intention to\nflee and reflects her deep need to communicate freely with counsel to prepare for her defense.\nHer renunciation of foreign citizenship obviates the Court’s concerns about the validity of\nwaivers of extradition. (See Dkt. lo6 at l3). Ms. Maxwell will have no ability to contest\nextradition from France or the United Kingdom on the basis of citizenship, which removes any\nincentive the Court and government believe she may have to seek refuge in those countries.\n\nB. Restraint and Monitoring of Assets\n\nIn denying bail, the Court noted that the bond was not fully secured, and that Ms.\nMaxwell and her spouse would still have several million dollars in unrestrained assets that could\nbe used to facilitate her flight from the country. (See id. at l7-l8). To assuage any concerns that\nthose assets would be available to finance flight to and shelter in a foreign country, Ms. Maxwell\nhas taken steps to create a monitorship that will place meaningful restraints on the assets that are\nnot used to secure the bond, while still allouing Ms. Maxwell to pay for her legal defense, for\nher spouse to pay for daily living expenditures and for payment of taxes.\n\nl. New Account\n\nAll assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse, with the exception of money currently held in\nescrou for legal fees and related defense expenses and the funds contained in the bank account in\nthe name of Ms. Maxwell’s spouse (“the Personal Account’”)!, will be deposited in a newly\ncreated account (“the New Account”) to be overseen by an asset monitor appointed pursuant to\norder of the Court. The New Account will contain all of Ms. Maxwell’s and her spouse’s\nremaining cash and other liquid assets, including any proceeds that result from the pending sale\nl The Personal Account is identified as Account I on page 9 of the Financial Report annexed to Ms. Maxwell’s\nRenewed Bail Application.

No illiquid assets may\nbe sold, conveyed or transferred without approval of the asset monitor.\n\nDe Other Assets\n\nThe only funds that will not be included in the New Account are (l) the money currently\nheld in escrou by Ms. Maxwell’s atorneys, which will be used exclusively for her defense; and\n(2) the roughly $45o,ooo in the Personal Account which her spouse will use only for living\nexpenses. The asset monitor shall regularly receive information regarding activity of the Personal\nAccount, including the account balance, on a weekly basis. The asset monitor must also receive\nfive-day advance notice of any check, on-line payment, or transfer of funds in any amount\nexceeding $5,ooo, and the reason for such payment. Ms. Maxwell’s spouse agrees to be bound\nby these restrictions and reporting requirements.\n\nThe asset monitor shall report to Pretrial Services any possible non-compliance or\ndisbursement in violation of the terms and conditions specified above.\n\n3. Selected Asset Monitor\n\nThe Honorable William S. Duffey, Jr., a retired federal District Court judge and the\nformer United States Atorney for the Northern District of Georgia, has agreed to undertake the\nposition of asset monitor.

Ms. Maxwell’s Pretrial Motions Raise Substantial Legal and Factual Issues\n\nThat Could Result in Dismissal of Some or All of the Charges Against Her\n\nIn addition to the new conditions proposed above, the numerous substantive pretrial\nmotions nou before the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.\nMs. Maxwell’s pretrial motions raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of\ncharges, if not the entire indictment. Among the dozen submissions are motions to dismiss the\nsuperseding indictment for breach of the non-prosecution agreement, for pre-indictment delay,\nand for being based on improperly obtained evidence in violation of Ms. Maxwell’s\nconstitutional rights under the Fifth and Sixth the Amendments. Other motions seek dismissal of\nthe Mann Act charges as being time-barred and the perjury charges as based on non-perjurious\nstatements. These motions are substantial with a likelihood of success on the merits. These\nmotions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength of the government’s case and warrant\ngranting bail on the conditions proposed.\nIi. The Court Should Grant Bail\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act of l984, a defendant must be released on personal\nrecognizance or unsecured personal bond unless the judicial officer determines “that such release\nwill not reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required or will endanger the safety of\nany other person or the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(b). The enhanced bail package proposed\nby Ms. Maxwell contains financial burdens and a combination of restrictions that reasonably\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2738\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002739.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l6o Filed o2/23/2l Page 8 of 9\nassure her appearance as required. Before preventive detention may be ordered under § 3l42(e),\nthe Court is obliged to determine both whether the defendant is likely to flee the jurisdiction if\nreleased, and whether any conditions of release will be reasonably certain to guard against this\npropensity to flee. The Court expressed concerns and denied bail without indicating what\nconditions would be reasonably certain to assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance. Ms. Maxwell is no\ndanger to the community and not alleged to have been involved in ongoing criminal activity. To\nsay that there are absolutely no conditions flies in the face of cases where non-United States\ncitizens with no ties to the district, let alone the country, were released on lesser conditions for\nalleged criminality ongoing up to or within hours of the time of arrest, in contrast to 26-year-old\nclaims alleged against Ms. Maxwell.”\n\nThe additional conditions set forth above, which supplement the exceptional bail package\npreviously proposed, are sufficient to address the hypothetical risk of flight and secure Ms.\nMaxwell’s presence at trial. The financial magnitude of the proposed bonds, the collateral\npledged to secure the bonds, the stringent requirements of home detention, the renunciation of\nforeign citizenship and monitoring of assets contained in a special account from which no funds\ncan be withdrawn without the approval and signature of a retired federal District Court judge and\nformer United States Atorney are conditions that amply satisfy the concerns expressed by the\ngovernment and the Court. These cnditions are unique and unprecedented. They profoundly\n* See Dkt. 97 at 34 (case-comparison chart in the Renewed Motion for Bail); cf People v. Dominique Strauss-Kahn,\no2526/2oll(S.Ct. N.Y.

The accusations were corroborated by semen containing Strauss-Kahn’s DNA\non the accuser’s uniform.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in opposition to the defendant’s third\nmotion for release on bail, dated February 23, 2o2l (the “Third Bail Motion” or the “Motion’”).\n(Dkt. No. l6o). On July l4, 2o2o, after extensive briefing and a lengthy hearing, this Court\nconcluded that the defendant posed a serious flight risk and that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance in court. On December 28, 2o2o, after the defendant\nrenewed her motion for release on bail (the “Second Bail Motion”) by essentially restating her\nprior arguments and presenting a more significant and specific bail package, this Court issued a\nthorough opinion and again concluded that the defendant “plainly poses a risk of flight” and denied\nthe motion for “substantially the same reasons that the Court denied” her first motion for release.\n(Dkt. No. lo6 at l-2 (“Dec. Op.”)). The defendant appealed this Court’s December 2o2o decision\nto the Second Circuit, and that appeal remains pending. Nou, the defendant asks the Court yet\nagain to reconsider its decision, and proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the bail\npackage the Court previously considered and rejected. For the reasons set forth belou, the Motion\nshould be denied. First, the Court does not have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion—in\nwhich she asks this Court to reconsider its December opinion—because the defendant has appealed\nthat December opinion to the Second Circuit. Second, even assuming the Court had jurisdiction\nto grant this latest bail application, the Court should adhere to its prior rulings because the\ndefendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and the additional bail conditions proposed\nby the defendant do not justify reversal of the Court’s prior findings that no combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion should be denied.\n\nI. Background\n\nThe Government’s December l6, 2o2o opposition to the defendant’s Second Bail Motion\ndetails the background of the initial bail proceedings in this case and is incorporated by reference\nherein. (See Dkt. No. loo at 2-6). After this Court denied the defendant’s initial application for\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2748\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002749.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 2 of 9\nPage 2\n\nbail in July 2o2o, the defendant filed a renewed motion for release in December 2o2o in which the\ndefendant proposed a “substantially larger bail package” and presented arguments that “either were\nmade at the initial bail hearing or could have been made then.” (Dec. Op. at l). In denying that\nsecond application, the Court found that the information provided in the Second Bail Motion “only\nsolidifies the Court’s view that the Defendant plainly poses a risk of flight and that no combination\nof conditions can ensure her appearance.” (/d. at l-2).\n\nOn January ll, 2o2l, the defendant filed a notice of appeal to the Second Circuit appealing\nthe Court’s December 2o2o opinion denying the Second Bail Motion. (Dkt. No. ll3). That appeal\nis pending; the defendant has not yet filed her brief in support of the appeal.\n\nOn February 23, 2o2l, the defendant submited the Third Bail Motion, in which she\nproposed two additional bail conditions to “supplement the . . . bail package she has already\noffered” in the Second Bail Motion (Mot. at 2): (l) renunciation of the defendant’s French and\nBritish citizenship; and (2) placement of a portion of her and her spouse’s assets in a new account\nto be overseen by an asset monitor.\n\nIl. The Court Does Not Have Jurisdiction to Grant the Third Bail Motion Because of\nthe Defendant’s Pending Bail Appeal\n\nThe defendant asks this Court to “reconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the\nproposed conditions.” (Mot. at 4). More specifically, the defendant asks the Court to consider the\nexact same package previously considered and rejected in the December opinion, as nou\n“supplement[ed]” by two additional conditions. (/d. at 2,8). Houever, the Court lacks jurisdiction\nto grant the Motion by virtue of the defendant’s appeal of the Court’s prior ruling to the Second\nCircuit.\n\n“As a general mater, ‘the filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional\nsignificance—it confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its\ncontrol over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.’” United States v. Rodgers, lol F.3d\n247, 25l (2d Cir. l996) (quoting Griggs v. Provident Consumer Disc. Co., 459 U.S. 56, 58 (l982)).\n“The divestiture of jurisdiction rule . . . is a judicially crafted rule rooted in the interest of judicial\neconomy, designed ‘to avoid confusion or waste of time resulting from having the same issues\nbefore two courts at the same time.’” Rodgers, lol F.3d at 25l (quoting United States v. Salerno,\n868 F.2d 524, 54o (2d Cir. l989)); see also United States v. Ransom, 866 F.2d 574, 576 (2d Cir.\nl989) (describing the Griggs rule as “promot[ing] the orderly conduct of business in both the trial\nand appellate courts”).\n\nIn January 2o2l, the defendant filed an appeal from the Court’s December 28, 2o2o\nOpinion and Order denying her Second Bail Motion. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion not only\nseeks reconsideration of the very issue presently on appeal but does so by proposing two additional\nbail conditions to “supplement” the bail package proposed in the defendant’s Second Bail Motion,\n(Mot. at 2, 8), a package which this Court considered and concluded could not “reasonably assure\nher appearance.” (Dec. Op. at l6). Accordingly, the defendant’s Third Bail Motion also concerns\nbail and is thus an “aspect[] of the case involved in the appeal.” Rodgers, lol F.3d at 25l. The\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2749\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002751.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 4 of 9\nPage 4\n\nare serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the\nGovernment, including multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, is strong; the\nDefendant has substantial resources and foreign ties (including citizenship in a country that does\nnot extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who lived in hiding and apart from the family to\nwhom she nou asserts important ties, has not been fully candid about her financial situation.”\n(Dec. Op. at 2). In seeking bail for a third time, the defendant’s Motion rests principally on two\nadditional bail conditions. Neither of these conditions will reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, and neither outweighs all of the other factors that make this defendant an\nextreme flight risk. Moreover, the Court should reject as premature the defendant’s assertion that\nher pretrial motions have somehou weakened the Government’s case; those motions have not been\nadjudicated, and, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s opposition memorandum, the\ndefendant’s motions have no merit.\n\nIn short, all three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncontinue to weigh heavily in favor of detention, and the defendant’s Motion does not present any\ninformation that warrants revisiting this Court’s well-reasoned and detailed prior decisions.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n“After a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can reasonably\nassure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail hearing if\n‘information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a\nmaterial bearing on the issue’ of whether pretrial detention is warranted.” (Dec. Op. at 4 (quoting\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)). “A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent authority,\neven where the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text.” (Ud. at 5). Although courts\nin this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence\nproffered on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing,” United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3),\ngenerally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant reconsideration” by, for\nexample, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or incorrectly applied the law,” or\nthat failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.” United States v. Petrov, No. l5\nCr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s Motion rests on three arguments, none of which is availing. First, the\ndefendant offers to renounce her foreign citizenship, claiming that this eliminates the risk that she\nwill flee from prosecution. Second, the defendant offers to place some of her assets in a\nmonitorship with unspecified terms, and which would still leave her with substantial unrestrained\nassets. Third, the defendant claims that her voluminous pretrial motions have diminished the\nstrength of the Government’s case. None of these arguments is persuasive, and the Motion should\nbe denied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo275l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002753.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 6 of 9\nPage 6\nher intent not to flee. (Dec. Op. at l3 n.2). The Court recognized that “a defendant could\nstrategically offer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent\nextradition that might result.” (/d.). So too here. An offer to renounce her foreign citizenship\n“Ts|hould the Court feel this drastic <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> is necessary,” (Mot. at 4) is another strategic, but\nhollou offer given that the defendant would be free to fight extradition once in the United Kingdom\nor France, or any other jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chooses to flee).\n\nAs such, the defendant’s claimed “willing[ness]” to renounce her citizenship in both the\nUnited Kingdom and France is litle more than windou dressing. After receiving the defendant’s\nThird Bail Motion, the Government, through the Department of Justice’s Office of International\nAffairs (“OIA”), contacted the French Ministry of Justice (“MOJ”) to understand the impact of the\ndefendant’s offer to renounce her French citizenship on France’s categorical unwillingness to\ndeport its oun citizens for crimes they have commited. In response, the MOJ provided the\nGovernment with a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively indicating that the\ndefendant’s offer to waive her French citizenship will not make her eligible to be extradited from\nFrance because, for purposes of extradition, nationality is assessed as of the time the charged\noffense was commited. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation of the\nleter, are atached hereto as Exhibit A. See Ex. A (“[A]ny loss of nationality subsequent to said\noffense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of\nnationality.”); see also Dkt. No. loo, Ex. B at 3 (MOJ leter stating that the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the extradition of a person who had French nationality\nat the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested”). The defendant’s\nrenunciation of her French citizenship in 2o2l would not change the fact that she was a French\ncitizen at the time she is alleged to have commited the charged crimes in the l99os and 2ol6. As\nsuch, the defendant’s citizenship at the time of the alleged crimes would bar her extradition from\nFrance, making her offer to renounce her French citizenship meaningless.\n\nMeanwhile, the defendant’s offer to give up her British citizenship does not mean that she\nwill not fight extradition once in the United Kingdom or that an extradition request to the United\nKingdom would be successful. The Government understands from OJA that a defendant’s\nnationality has historically played litle to no role in extradition from the United Kingdom. Indeed,\nArticle 3 of the 2oo3 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom\nexpressly prohibits using nationality as a basis to deny _ extradition. See\nhtps://www.congress.gov/lo8/cdoc/tdoc23/CDOC-lo8tdoc23.pdf at 5 (“Extradition shall not be\nrefused based on the nationality of the person sought.”); see also Croun Prosecution Service,\nExtradition, Legal Guidance, International and organised crime (May l2, 2o2o),\nhtps://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/extradition (seting forth the statutory bars to extradition,\nwhich do not include nationality). In any event, assuming the Government could locate and\napprehend the defendant if she were to flee, as set forth in the Government’s opposition to the\nSecond Bail Motion, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on\nextradition based on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the\npassage of time, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>. The\nGovernment understands from OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently\nextensively litigated, uncertain, and subject to multiple levels of appeal. This process is lengthy,\ncomplicated, and time-consuming, and would provide no measure of justice to the victims who\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2753\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002754.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 7 of 9\nPage 7\nwould be forced to wait years for the defendant’s return.\n\nAs the Government has repeatedly emphasized, the strong possibility that the defendant\ncould successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee. (Dkt. No.\nloo at l9-2o). Indeed, in rejecting the defendant’s offer in the Second Bail Motion to execute\nanticipatory extradition waivers, the Court noted, among other things, “the likelihood that any\nextradition would be a difficult and lengthy process.” (Dec. Op. at l3). The Court further noted\nthat the “likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any extradition requests—even\nif she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition entirely—weighs strongly in favor\nof detention.” (/d.). That statement remains true even if the face of the defendant’s newest offer\nto renounce her foreign citizenship.\n\nAs this Court previously found, the defendant has substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, and ouns at least one foreign property of significant value. (Dec.\nOp. at lo-ll). The defendant’s alleged willingness to renounce her foreign citizenship should not\nfundamentally alter the Court’s conclusions.\n\n2. The Court Should Reject the Defendant’s Proposed Monitorship <span class=\"highlight\">Condition</span>\n\nNext, the defendant has offered to place a portion of her and her spouse’s assets into a new\naccount that “will be monitored by a retired federal District Court judge and former United States\nAtorney who will function as asset monitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.”\n(Mot. at 2). This proposed <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>—the details of which are vague—is insufficient to ensure\nthat the defendant appears in Court.\n\nIt first bears noting that the defendant’s finances—and her candor with the Court about\nthose finances— is not an issue of first impression. Significantly absent from the defendant’s\nMotion is any atempt to address the Court’s determination that the defendant’s “lack of candor\nraises significant concerns as to whether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate\npicture of her finances and as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of\nrelease.” (Dec. Op. at l6). That is critical because the value of any proposed monitorship would\ndepend entirely on the monitor having a completely accurate picture of the defendant’s finances\nand access to all of her accounts and sources of wealth. Given the Court’s concerns about the\ndefendant’s candor, the Court should hesitate before trusting the defendant to be transparent with\na monitor under her employ.\n\nIn any event, even if the Court were to accept the defendant’s representations about her\nassets at face value, the defendant’s proposal would leave the defendant with significant assets\nunrestrained. In particular, the defendant’s proposal does not in any way restrain her $2 million\ntounhouse in London, which she could live in or sell to support herself. Although the defendant\nasserts that the monitor would oversee any account into which the proceeds of the sale of the\ndefendant’s properties were deposited, the defendant does not explain hou the monitor—or this\nCourt—would have the authority to force the defendant to deposit foreign assets in a domestic\naccount. As the Government has previously explained, the Government cannot realistically\nrecover assets abroad. Accordingly, the defendant’s proposal would leave her with access to at\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2754\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002755.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 8 of 9\nPage 8\nleast $2 million. In addition, the defendant proposes that she retain an additional half a million\ndollars in liquid assets in an unrestrained account, as well as any future income.” That figure\nappears to be in addition to the approximately $l million in “chatels” the defendant has disclosed\namong her various assets. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. In short, the defendant’s proposal would leave\nher with ample resources to fund her flight from prosecution.\n\nFurther still, the defendant’s Motion provides only cursory details of the monitorship\nprogram she proposes, and it offers no legal precedent to explain what, if any, authority this Court\nhas to establish and oversee such a monitorship. Aside from defense counsel’s assertions, the\nMotion offers nothing that would enable the Court to meaningfully consider the details of such a\nmonitorship. Among other things, it is unclear from the defendant’s Motion whether such a\nprogram would require the defendant’s voluntary compliance with the monitorship, or whether the\nfunds would be placed in a bank account that the defendant could not access. Given that the\ndefendant’s Motion suggests that atorney’s fees could be disbursed without approval, it appears\nthat the defendant’s proposal would provide her latitude to engage in financial transactions, subject\nonly to a review that would require her voluntary compliance.\n\nFinally, although the defendant does not provide any detail about the amount of money she\nwould pay the monitor, presumably the monitor would not undertake this responsibility for free.\nAs a result, the tension between the monitor’s obligation to review the defendant’s finances and\nthe monitor’s employment relationship with the defendant creates a conflict of interest. But at\nbotom, if the Court determines that the only way to keep the defendant from using her assets to\nflee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too great a flight risk to release.\n\nIn sum, in light of this Court’s determination that the defendant “has not been fully candid\nabout her financial situation,” the Court should reject the defendant’s vague proposal. (Dec. Op.\nat 2). Nothing in the defendant’s Motion should alter the Court’s determination that the defendant\nposes a significant risk of flight, and that she has the resources and skills to flee prosecution. The\nCourt should reject the proposed bail conditions.\n\n3. The Defendant’s Pending Pretrial Motions Have Not Diminished the Strength\nof the Government’s Case\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that the “numerous substantive pretrial motions nou\nbefore the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.” (Mot. at 7).\nBut the defendant cannot merely point to the sheer volume of briefing she has filed to suggest that\nthe strength of the Government’s case has diminished. To the contrary, as the Government has set\nforth in detail in its memorandum in opposition, the defendant’s pretrial motions are entirely\nwithout merit. In any event, it is premature for the defendant to claim that her pretrial motions—\nwhich have not been adjudicated, much less granted—have altered the Court’s original\n> The defendant’s proposal also leaves unrestrained several million dollars in escrou for the\ndefendant’s legal fees. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9 (listing approximately $7.6 million in retainer fees);\nsee also Mot. at 6. If the defendant fled the country, her counsel would presumably be required to\nreturn those funds to the defendant, who would no longer need defense counsel in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2755\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002756.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 9 of 9\nPage 9\ndetermination that the Government’s case is strong.\nIV. Conclusion\nThe defendant continues to represent a “plain[]” risk of flight. (Dec. Op. at l). Even\nassuming the Court has jurisdiction to grant this third bail motion, the two new bail conditions\noffer insufficient protection against the “substantial and actual risk of flight” this Court has already\nfound that the defendant poses.

Thus, for substantially the\nsame reasons that the Court denied the Defendant’s first and second motions for release, the\nCourt DENIES the Defendant’s third motion for release on bail.\n\nl. Background\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The\nDefendant has been incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center since that time.\n\nThe Defendant renewed her motion for release on bail on December 8, 2o2o. The Court\nagain denied the Defendant’s motion. In doing so, the Court explained that none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments materially impacted its conclusion that the Defendant posed a risk of\nflight. It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry\nlengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the Government,\nincluding multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant’s\nsubstantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2768\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002769.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l69 Filed o3/22/2l Page 3 of l2\nescape; and that the Defendant’s lack of candor regarding her family ties and financial situations\nraised serious doubts as to her willingness to comply with any conditions imposed by the Court.\nSee Dkt. No. lo6.\n\nOn February 23, 2o2l, the Defendant filed a third motion for release on bail. Dkt. No.\nl6o (“Def. Mot.”). The Government opposed the Defendant’s motion on March 9, 2o2l. Dkt.\nNo. l65 (“Gov’t Opp’n’”). The Defendant filed her reply under temporary seal on March l6,\n2o2l.\n\nI. Legal Standard\n\nThe parties dispute whether the divestiture of jurisdiction rule precludes this Court from\ngranting the Defendant’s third bail motion while Defendant’s bail appeal is pending. See Gov’t\nOpp’n at 2-3; Reply at 2-3; see also United States v. Rodgers, lol F.3d 247, 25l (2d Cir. l996)\n(“As a general mater, ‘the filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional significance—\nit confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its control over\nthose aspects of the case involved in the appeal.’”) (citation omited). Under Rule 37(a) of the\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure, houever, the Court unquestionably has authority to defer\nconsidering the motion, deny the motion, or state either that it would grant the motion if the court\nof appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a substantial issue. Fed. R. Crim. P.\n37(a). Because the Court denies the Defendant’s motion, it does not resolve the question of\nwhether it would have jurisdiction to grant it.\n\nPretrial detainees have a right to bail under the Eighth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution and under the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l4l, et seg. The Bail Reform Act\nrequires that a court release a defendant “subject to the least restrictive further <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>, or\ncombination of conditions, that [it] determines will reasonably assure the appearance of the\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2769\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002770.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l69 Filed o3/22/2l Page 4 of l2\nperson as required and the safety of any other person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(c)(l)(B). The Court may order that the defendant be held without bail only if, after\nconsidering the factors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>\nor combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and\nthe safety of any other person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nAfter a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can\nreasonably assure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Bail Reform Act allous the\nCourt to reopen the bail hearing if “information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the\ntime of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue” of whether pretrial detention is\nwarranted. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f). The Court is not required to do so if it determines that any new\ninformation would not have a material bearing on the issue. See United States v. Raniere, No.\nl8-CR-2o4l (NGG) (VMS), 2ol8 WL 63442o2, at *2 n.7 (E.D.N.Y.

Supp. 2d 335, 339 (W.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (electing not to reopen a detention hearing\nbecause the new information would not have changed the court’s decision to detain the defendant\nuntil trial). In addition, the Court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent\nauthority, even when the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text. See, e.g., United\nStates v.

The Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the Defendant presents a risk of flight and that there are no\nset of conditions, including the Defendant’s third set of proposed conditions, that are sufficient to\nreasonably assure her appearance. The presumption in favor of detention, the weight of the\nevidence, and the history and characteristics of the Defendant all continue to support that\nconclusion. The Defendant’s proposed conditions do not alter the Court’s determination.\n\nA. The Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors has not changed\n\nTo begin with, the presumption in favor of detention continues to apply with equal force.\nSee Dkt. No. lo6 (“Dec. Op.”) at 7-8. And though the Court again concludes that the Defendant\nhas met her burden of production, the presumption “remains a factor to be considered among\nthose weighed by the district court.” Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436 (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at\nll44). The Court is mindful “that Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of\nflight, and that ‘a strong probability arises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate\nto secure their appearance.” Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nThe Court’s analysis of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors also remains unchanged.\n\nBecause the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged include crimes involving a minor\nvictim, the first l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factor continues to weigh strongly in favor of detention.\nAnd the Court remains of the opinion that the Defendant does not pose a danger to any person or\nto the community. The fourth § 3l42(g) factor thus weighs against detention.\n\nWith respect to the second § 3l42(g) factor, none of the Defendant’s new arguments alter\nthe Court’s conclusion as to the weight of the evidence. The Defendant argues that the pre-trial\nmotions “raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of charges, if not the entire\nindictment,” and she contends that “[t]hese motions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2772\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002773.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l69 Filed o3/22/2l Page 7 of l2\nof the government’s case and warrant granting bail on the conditions proposed.” Def. Mot. at 7.\nThose motions became fully briefed one week ago and are nou pending before this Court. The\nGovernment strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated\nthem. Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the\npresumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the proffered strength\nand nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention. See Dec.\nOp. at 9-lo.\n\nThe Court’s assessment of the Defendant’s history and characteristics has not changed.\nSee Dec. Op. at lo-l6. The Defendant continues to have substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\ndetection. /d. at lo-ll. And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor\nregarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor.

While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors. While the fourth factor continues to\nfavor release, the first three factors and the presumption of detention all support the conclusion\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2773\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002774.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l69 Filed o3/22/2l Page 8 of l2\nthat the Defendant poses a significant risk of flight. Thus, the Court again concludes that there\nare no conditions of release that will reasonably assure her appearance in future proceedings.\n\nB. Pretrial detention continues to be warranted\n\nThe thrust of the Defendant’s argument in her third motion for bail is that the two new\nproposed conditions vitiate the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight. The Defendant first\noffers to renounce her French and British citizenship. Def. Mot. at 2. And she also proposes to\nhave most of her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be monitored by a\nretired federal judge, who would function as an asset monitor and will have co-signing authority\nover the account. /d. Those conditions are offered in addition to the bail package she proposed\nin December. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7; see also Def. Mot. at 2. The new bail package does not\ndisturb the Court’s conclusion that the Government has carried its burden of shouing that these\nconditions are insufficient to mitigate the flight risks, and the Court again determines that no set\nof conditions—including the two new ones—can reasonably assure her future appearance.\n\nThe Court begins with the Defendant’s offer to renounce her French and United Kingdom\ncitizenship. She notes that she can renounce her UK citizenship “immediately upon granting of\nbail,” and she informs the Court that “[t]he process of renouncing her French citizenship, while\nnot immediate, may be expedited.” Def. Mot. at 4. As the Government notes, the offer is of\nunclear validity, and the relevance and practical impact of the renunciations is, at best, unclear.\nSee Gov’t Opp’n at 5. With respect to her offer to renounce her French citizenship, the Court is\nagain confronted with dueling opinions on the correct interpretation of French law. The\nGovernment relies on the position of the head of the International Criminal Assistance Bureau of\nthe French Ministry of Justice, who argues that “the fact that the wanted individual is a French\nnational constitutes an insuperable obstacle to his/her removal,” and that “[a]s long as said\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2774\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002776.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l69 Filed o3/22/2l Page lo of l2\nparallel those that the Court articulated when the Defendant proposed signing an extradition\nwaiver. See Dec. Op. at l2-l3.\n\nSimilar doubts exist as to the Defendant’s offer to renounce her UK citizenship. The\nCourt is persuaded by the Government’s arguments that even if the Defendant were to renounce\nher UK citizenship, she would still likely be able to delay or resist extradition from the UK. See\nGov’t Opp’n at 6-7. And for largely similar reasons, the Court again concludes that the\nproposed conditions do not meaningfully diminish the Court’s concerns regarding the\nDefendant’s ability to flee and to frustrate or impair any subsequent extradition atempts. The\npossibility that the Defendant could successfully resist or forestall extradition heightens the\nDefendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nTo summarize, the Defendant’s willingness to renounce her French and UK citizenship\ndoes not sufficiently assuage the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight that the Defendant\nposes. Considerable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the\nrenunciations cloud whatever relevance they might otherwise have to the Court’s assessment of\nwhether the Defendant poses a risk of flight. See United States v. Cohen, No. C lo-oo547 (SD,\n2olo WL 5387757, at *9 n.ll (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2o, 2olo). And that same uncertainty—and the\npossibility that she will be able to successfully resist, or at least delay, extradition—incentivizes\nflight, particularly because of the Defendant’s substantial international ties.\n\nNor does the second proposed <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> materially alter the Court’s determination that no\n<span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions can reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The\nDefendant proposes to have a retired federal judge provide oversight authority over her financial\naffairs, and, if granted, he would have the authority to restrain, monitor, and approve\ndisbursement of assets requiring his signature. See Reply at 5.

But the Court assumes, for purposes of\nresolving this motion, that the financial report that it reviewed in December is accurate and that it\naccounts for all of the Defendant’s and her spouse’s assets. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7.\n\nThe monitorship <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> does not reasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance,\neven when viewed in combination with the rest of the Defendant’s bail package. The Defendant\nwould continue to have access to substantial assets—certainly enough to enable her flight and to\nevade prosecution. These include the $45o,ooo that the Defendant would retain for living\nexpenses and any future salaries for her or her spouse, along with other assets, including jewelry\nand other chatels, that are potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. See Def. Mot. at\n5-6; see also Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. While those amounts may be a small percentage of the\nDefendant’s total assets, they represent a still-substantial amount that could easily facilitate\nflight. When combined with the Court’s weighing of the § 3l42(g) factors and the presumption\nof detention, the Court concludes that the proposed restraints are insufficient to alter its\nconclusion that no combination of conditions can reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nIf the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could reasonably assure the\nDefendant’s future appearance, it would order her release. Yet while her proposed bail package\nis substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable assurances. As a result, the Court again\ndetermines that “no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the\nappearance of” the Defendant, and it denies her motion for bail on this basis. l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(l).\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2777\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002782.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl7l Filed o3/23/2l Page2ofl8\nPreliminary Statement\nThe issue before the Court, as it has been since Ms. Maxwell’s first bail application,\n\nis whether conditions exist that can reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell's appearance at trial.\nOn her third application (the “Third Bail Motion”) (Dkt.l6o), Ms. Maxwell has put before\nthe Court significant enhancements to the already extraordinary bail package previously\npresented to the Court in her renewed application for bail (the “Second Bail Motion’’)\n(Dkt. 97).!

To the contrary, it was\ndesigned to apply to individuals who had acquired French citizenship subsequent to the\ncommission of the alleged crime “in order to avoid fraudulent nationality applications of\noffenders seeking to escape extradition.” (Ud. 4§ l5-l6). Ifthe person is no longer a French\nnational at the time of the request, the provision does not apply.

Rather than suggest conditions to satisfy its concerns, the\ngovernment urges the Court to summarily reject the proposed monitorship.\n\nWilliam S.

Further, no valid\nchallenge has been made to those submissions.\n\nThe government challenges the Court by inanely stating that if “the only way to keep\nthe defendant from using her assets to flee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too\ngreat a risk to release.” (Dkt.l65 at 8.) This statement is fundamentally illogical as it\nundermines most conditions of release. For example, the same could be said of electronic\nmonitoring — l.e., if the only way to keep a defendant from fleeing the jurisdiction is to place\nhim on home confinement with electronic monitoring, then he is too great a flight risk to\nrelease.* The Court should readily dismiss this frivolous argument. Under the Bail Reform Act,\nif there are appropriate conditions for release, bail should be granted. The conditions\ncollectively proposed in the previous and present bail applications provide ample assurance that\nMs. Maxwell will be present at trial.\n\n3 Moreover, in an effort to further obfuscate the merits of Ms. Maxwell’s bail application, the government\ndesperately argues that funds for legal services, presently held in atorney escrou accounts, would be\nreleased and made available to support Ms. Maxwell as a fugitive. To suggest that defense counsel would\nbecome accomplices to a violation of a court order shous uter disrespect for Ms. Maxwell’s defense team.\nIn particular, New York counsel, who have spent the entirety of their legal careers practicing in this district\nand establishing well-respected reputations among the bench and bar, take umbrage at the government’s\ncallous assertion.\n\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2787\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002790.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl7l Filed o3/23/2l Pageloofl8\nReform Act, Ms. Maxwell must be released unless there are \"no conditions\" that would\nreasonably assure her presence.

No mater hou often the government tries\nto present Ms. Maxwell’s detention as superior to other inmates, it continues to miss the mark.\nWe stand by our previous responses and reiterate that Ms. Maxwell’s detention is unwarranted\nand overly restrictive. It is tantamount to “pay-it-forward” punishment served pretrial.\n\nThe government’s leter provides the opportunity to flush out the persistent unsanitary\nconditions at the MDC, which long predate Ms. Maxwell’s detention. This past weekend there\nwas a pervasive stench of sewage in Ms. Maxwell’s unit necessitating guards to flush pipes by\npouring water doun open drains in an effort to trap and disperse gaseous emissions. As guards\nexplained to Ms. Maxwell, there are three drains in the day area, and when the plumbing system\ngoes unused, gases escape from the drains and cause the stench. At times the stench in Ms.\nMaxwell’s isolation cell has been overwhelming due to overflouing of toilets in the cellblock\nabove. Due to lack of privacy, Ms. Maxwell refrains from using the toilet in the isolation cell\nand, as directed by the guards, she flushes frequently to avoid plumbing problems.

She is weighed while\nclothed on scales that are erratic and not set to zero; on at least one occasion, the scale was set\nabove five pounds. Her eyesight is failing, and her hair is thinning.

The guard responsible for the abuse is a member of a rotating\nteam that has been the subject of complaint, yet some members were reassigned to Ms. Maxwell\nfor the past two weeks. The incident at issue occurred when Ms. Maxwell was facing forward in\nfront of an officer whose back was in front of the handheld camera. On information and belief,\nthe camera was not recording at that time. The government disputes Ms. Maxwell’s claim by\nciting a video.

The computer equipment provided remains\ninadequate to review the millions of pages of discovery under circumstances that are not\nconducive to preparing for trial. It is unreasonable to believe that not being able to search, mark,\nsave, and print is sufficient to prepare this document-laden case for trial.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nWe write in reply to the government’s April 9th leter opposing a trial continuance.\n\nThe defense has been steadfastly and diligently preparing for a July l2\" trial based on the\noriginal indictment, a date set on the <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> that there would be no superseding indictment\nadding substantive charges. The recently filed superseding indictment directly contravenes that\nagreement and adds two new charges which vastly expand the relevant time period from a four-\nyear period in the l99os to an eleven-year period stretching from l994 to 2oo4. These additions\nsignificantly alter the scope of the government’s case and necessarily shift the focus of the\ndefense’s trial preparation. Instead of being focused on mounting a defense to the allegations of\nthe three accusers from the l99os, as we have been doing, the defense will nou have to spend\nconsiderable time and resources investigating allegations of new conduct in a completely\ndifferent time period involving numerous additional witnesses, and with all of the difficulties that\nCOVID restrictions still place on a meaningful defense investigation.\n\nWe do not want to postpone the trial but have no choice but to ask for a continuance. The\ngovernment bears responsibility for this need, having filed a late-breaking superseding\nindictment based on a witness who has been knoun to the government since the Florida\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2925\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002968.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 34 of 239\nnot parties to the agreement. This position is at odds with the law in this Circuit, which presumes\na narrou reading of the boundaries of a plea agreement unless a defendant can affirmatively\nestablish that a more expansive interpretation was contemplated.”’) (citing Annabi, 77l F.2d at\n672). To hold otherwise would turn Annabi on its head.\n\nThe defendant next argues that the follouing provision of the NPA evinces an intent to\n\nbind the entire federal government:\n\nIn consideration of Epstein’s agreement to plead guilty and to\n\nprovide compensation in the manner described above, if Epstein\n\nsuccessfully fulfills all of the terms and conditions of this\n\nagreement, the United States also agrees that it will not institute any\n\ncriminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,\n\nincluding but not limited to Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley\n\nGroff, or Nadia Marcinkova.\nNPA at 5; Def. Mot. l at 2o-2l. Aside from the reference to “United States” which, as noted\nabove, is insufficient, the defendant does not point to any language in this provision that\npurportedly binds other districts. Instead, she argues that the absence of language specifically\nlimiting this provision to the USAO-SDFL demonstrates an intent to bind the entire federal\ngovernment. This argument fails, for at least three reasons. First, the defendant’s argument inverts\nthe holding of Annabi: in this Circuit, the presumption is that plea agreements bind only the district\nin which they are entered, absent affirmative indications otherwise. Put differently, the absence\nof express limiting language in this provision is not an affirmative indication of a broader\napplication. Accordingly, under Second Circuit law, the absence of limiting language in this\nspecific provision provides no support for the defendant’s motion.\n\nSecond, the defendant’s argument acknouledges that the plain terms of the NPA\nimmunized Epstein from prosecution in “this District,” that is, the Southern District of Florida.\nSee NPA at 2 (“After timely fulfilling all the terms and conditions of the Agreement, no\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2968\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002978.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 44 of 239\nGovernment’s promises in the plea agreement to only cover past crimes, observing that “not\nlimiting the prohibition to past crimes would make it absurd and probably illegal”) (citing Aronson\nv. K. Arakelian, Inc., l54 F.2d 23l, 233 (7th Cir. l946) (“[A] contract will not be presumed to\nhave imposed an absurd or impossible <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> on one of the parties, but will be interpreted as\nthe parties must be supposed to have understood the conditions at the time.”)).\n\nFinally, the defendant claims that the NPA covers all violations of the Mann Act. (Def.\nMot. | at 26 n.4). Not so. The NPA lists specific statutory provisions within the Mann Act, but\nnone of the provisions contained in the Indictment. In particular, the NPA expressly covers\nviolations of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422(b), 2423(b), and 2423(e), but it does not include the particular\nprovisions charged in the Indictment against Maxwell, which alleges violations of §§ 2422(a) and\n2423(a). These are plainly not the same crimes, and a plea agreement cannot be read to immunize\nunnamed crimes in the general ballpark of the specific crimes enumerated in the agreement. The\ndefendant cites no authority that supports her overbroad reading of this provision.\n\nAccordingly, the NPA immunizes only certain, specific offenses, none of which are\ncontained in the Indictment. As a result, the defendant cannot invoke the NPA to seek the dismissal\nof the Indictment.\n\n2. The NPA Does Not Confer Enforceable Rights on Maxwell\n\nEven if this Court were to construe the NPA beyond its plain terms to preclude prosecutions\nfor the crimes contained in the Indictment, the defendant has established neither that those\nprotections extend to Maxwell specifically, nor that she has standing to pursue those protections.\n\nThe defendant asks this Court to interpret the NPA according to contract principles, and\naccord the defendant standing to enforce the NPA as a third party beneficiary. As a general mater,\nplea agreements are interpreted using principles from contract law, but that maxim is not without\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2978\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003161.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 227 of 239\nspecific than the District where the offense was allegedly commited.”).

SDNY Jury Plan Art. III.B, HI.C. This is perfectly consistent with\nthe JSSA, see 28 U.S.C. § l869(e), and with longstanding precedent, as Judge Hand has explained:\n\n[T]he district and circuit courts have had pouer since the first\n\nJudiciary Act of l789 to divide a district territorially in the interest\n\nof an impartial trial, of economy, and of lessening the burden of\n\natendance. There cannot be the faintest question of the\n\nconstitutionality of this statute; the courts have again and again\n\nrecognized its validity. Furthermore, it would be impossible in\n\npractice to administer it, if it were a <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> that that the divisions\n\nmade must be so homogeneous that they shoued an equal\n\npercentage of all possible groups. There are probably no districts in\n\nthe Union, which can be divided without disclosing in the sections\n\ndifferent racial, religious, political, social or economic percentages.\n\nTo demand that they shall not, would be a fantastic pedantry which\n\nwould serve no purpose and would put an end to the statute.\nUnited States v. Gotfried, l65 F.2d 36o, 364 (2d Cir. l948); accord Bahna, 68 F.3d at 24-25.\n\nThere is accordingly no constitutional or statutory basis for the defendant’s claimed\nentitlement to a grand jury drawn from the population of the same “division” in which the offense\noccurred and she assumes she will ultimately be tried. To the contrary, the Second Circuit has\nrejected a similar claim. In Bahna, a defendant in the Eastern District of New York was initially\nconvicted at a trial held at the Brooklyn courthouse; after that conviction was vacated, he was\nagain convicted, this time at a trial held at the Uniondale courthouse. 68 F.3d at 2o.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.* The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

At\nthis point, Sloman left on vacation, and he informed Acosta and Villafafia that in his absence\nLourie had agreed “to help finalize this.” Lourie spent the follouing work week at his new post\nat the Department in Washington, D.C., but communicated with his USAO colleagues by phone\nand email.\n\nIn a Sunday, September l6, 2oo7 email, Villafafia informed Lefkouitz that she had drafted\na factual proffer to accompany a revised “hybrid” federal plea proposal. In that email, Villafafia\nalso noted that she was considering filing charges in the federal district court in Miami, “which\nwill hopefully cut the press coverage significantly.” This email received considerable atention l2\nyears later when it was made public during the CVRA litigation and was viewed as evidence of\nthe USAO’s efforts to conceal the NPA from the victims. Villafafia, houever, explained to OPR\nthat she was concerned that news media coverage would violate the victims’ privacy. She told\nOPR, “[I]f [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into\nthe courthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper,” and that such publicity\nwas less likely to happen in Miami, where the press “in general does not care about what happens\nin Palm Beach.”\n\nLefkouitz responded to Villafafia with a revised version of her latest proposed “hybrid”\nplea agreement, in a document entitled “Agreement.” Significantly, this defense proposal\nintroduced two new provisions. The first related to four female assistants who had allegedly\nfacilitated Epstein in his criminal scheme. The defense sought a government promise not to\nprosecute them, as well as certain other unnamed Epstein employees, and a promise to forego\nimmigration proceedings against two of the female assistants:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also\n\nprecludes the initiation of any and all criminal charges which might\n\notherwise in the future be brought against [four named female\n\nassistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate\n\nentity] for any criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal\n\ninvestigation . . . . Further, no immigration proceeding will be\n\ninstituted against [two named female assistants] as a result of the\n\nongoing investigation.\n\nThe second new provision related to the USAO’s efforts to obtain Epstein’s computers:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement\n\nresolves any and all outstanding [legal process] that have requested\n\nwitness testimony and/or the production of documents and/or\n\ncomputers in relation to the investigation that is the subject of the\n\nAgreement.

Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year conspiracy\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding recommendation for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\nsentenced in the state after he is sentenced in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be sentenced after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the resolution of all criminal liability, ‘and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she understood\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.!\"\n\nWith regard to immigration, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on immigration issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in connection with\ntheir immigration paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status. So there wasn’t any reason\nM3 OPR understood Villafafia’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry\ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to\ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3272\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003300.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l24 of 348\nthe defense “[f]irst and foremost” reaffirmed the NPA and that Epstein “has no intention of\nunwinding the agreement.”\n\nOn December 7, 2oo7—the deadline set by Acosta in his December 4, 2oo7 leter to Starr—\nthe defense transmited to the USAO a one-sentence “Affirmation” of the NPA and its addendum,\nsigned by Epstein. !*4\n\nF.

In one submission, 2o pages long, Lefkouitz\naddressed the “improper involvement” of federal authorities in the investigation and criticized\nVillafafia for a number of alleged improprieties, including having engaged in “unprecedented\nfederal overreaching” by seeking to prosecute Epstein federally, “insist[ing]” that the State\nAtorney’s Office “charge Mr. Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are\nsignificantly harsher than what the State deemed appropriate,” and requiring that Epstein plead\nguilty to a registrable offense, a “harsh” <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> that was “unwarranted.”!*°\n\nLefkouitz also argued that the federal investigation relied upon a state investigation that\nwas “tainted” by the lead PBPD Detective’s misrepresentation of key facts in affidavits and\ninterview summaries, leading the USAO to make its charging decision based on flawed\ninformation that “compromised the federal investigation.” Finally, Lefkouitz criticized federal\ninvolvement in the state plea process as a violation of “the tenets of the Petite Policy.” In a second,\nl3-page submission, Lefkouitz reiterated Epstein’s complaints about the § 2255 component of the\nNPA, arguing, among other things, that federal prosecutors “should not be in the business of\nhelping alleged victims of state crimes secure civil financial setlements.”\n\nl8 The Affirmation read: “I, Jeffrey E. Epstein do hereby re-affirm the Non-Prosecution Agreement and\nAddendum to same dated October 3o, 2oo7.”\nl55 Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a five-page leter responding to the accusations made against her personally.\n98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003312.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l36 of 348\n\nOn Monday, June 23, 2oo8, Roth sent a brief leter to Starr and Lefkouitz informing them\nthat the office had “completed a thorough review” of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater\nand did not believe intervention by the Deputy Atorney General was warranted in view of the\n“considerable discretion” vested by the Department in U.S. Atorneys. He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being sentenced, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence. On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls. Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try\nto take a further appeal in order to delay resolution of the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknouledging they had reached “the\nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While Iam obviously very unhappy at what I believe\nis the government’s treatment of my client, aman whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize\nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost. ... I would like to have .. . some\nclosure with you on this mater so that in the years to come, neither of us will harbor any ill will\nover the mater.”\n\nX. JUNE 2oo8 — JUNE 2oo9: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS PLEAS AND SERVES HIS\n\nCUSTODIAL SENTENCE\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia renewed her requests to Epstein’s local atorneys\nGoldberger and Black for a copy of the state plea agreement reached with the State Atorney’s\nOffice, noting that their failure to provide it was a material breach of the NPA. After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.”!”\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\n\nV2 The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

Finally, Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s purported “supervisor’—who as the\nFoundation’s vice president was subordinate to Epstein, the Foundation’s president—had\npromised to alert the Sheriff's Office if Epstein failed to comply with his work schedule, but the\n“supervisor” lived and worked in the New York metropolitan area and was unable to monitor\nEpstein’s activities on a day-to-day basis. The Sheriff's Office neither acknouledged nor\nresponded to Villafafia’s leter.\n\nIn March 2oo9, Sloman met in Miami with Dershouitz for, as Dershouitz characterized it\nin a subsequent email, “a relaxed drink and conversation,” which included a discussion of the\nEpstein case. After that encounter, Dershouitz emailed Sloman, expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “assurance that the feds will not interfere with hou the Palm Beach sheriff administers”\nEpstein’s sentence “as long as he is treated like any similarly situated inmate.” Sloman responded:\n\nRegarding Mr. Epstein, the United States Atorney’s Office will not\ninterfere with hou the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office administers the\nsentence imposed by the Court. That being said, this does not mean\nthat the USAO condones or encourages the PBSO to mitigate the\nterms and conditions of his sentence. Furthermore, it does not mean\nthat, if contacted for our position concerning alternative custody or\nin-home detention, we would not object. To be clear, if contacted\nwe will object. Naturally, I also expect that no one on behalf of\nMr. Epstein will use my assurance to you to affirmatively represent\nto PBSO that the USAO does not object to an alternative custody or\nhome detention.\n\nA week later, Dershouitz emailed Sloman again, this time expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “willingness to call the sheriff and advise him that your office would take no position\non hou he handled Epstein’s sentence,” as long as Epstein did not receive special treatment, but\nadding, “[L]et’s put any call off for a while.”\n\nEpstein’s sentence required that he be confined to his home for a l2-month period\nfollouing his release from prison. On July 22, 2oo9, almost l3 months after he began serving his\nsentence, Epstein was released from the Stockade and placed on home confinement.!® At this\ntime, he registered as a sexual offender.\n\nXI. POST-RELEASE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nIn the summer of 2oo9, allegations surfaced that Epstein had cooperated with the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York’s investigation of investment bank Bear\nStearns, and that he had been released early from his l8-month imprisonment term because of that\nl85 In Florida, what is commonly referred to as house arrest is actually the Community Control supervision\nprogram.

Whatever the reason,\n\nwhen it appears that the Federal interest in prosecution is less\n\nsubstantial than the interest of state or local authorities,\n\nconsideration should be given to referring the case to those\n\nauthorities rather than commencing or recommending a Federal\n\nprosecution.\nAnother comment cautions that in assessing whether to defer to state or local authorities, “the\nFederal prosecutor should be alert to any local conditions, atitudes, relationships or other\ncircumstances that might cast doubt on the likelihood of the state or local authorities conducting a\nthorough and successful prosecution.”\n\nUSAM § 9-27.26o identifies impermissible considerations relating to the decision whether\nto initiate or decline a federal prosecution. Specifically, the decision may not be based on\nconsideration of the person’s race, religion, sex, national origin, or political association, activities,\nor beliefs; the prosecutor’s “oun personal feelings” about the person or the victim; or the possible\neffect of the decision on the prosecutor’s oun professional or personal circumstances. When\nopting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision\nare communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files. USAM § 9-27.27o.\n\n2. USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°” The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist. The prerequisites are as follous:\n\n(l) The mater must involve a substantial federal interest. The determination whether\n\na substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis. Maters\nl92 See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22, 27-29 (l977); Petite v.

In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\n\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\ntee, l98\ncrime.\n\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)(), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\n\nC. Case Law\n\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\n\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\n\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3329\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003366.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9o of 348\n\nOPR asked Villafafia about these emails and about the tenor of her interactions with\nLefkouitz during the NPA negotiations and with other defense atorneys generally. Villafafia\nacknouledged that their tone was collegial and collaborative, and explained that generally, the\ntone of these emails reflected her personality and her commitment to complete the task her\nsupervisors had assigned to her:\n\n[I|f you were to pull all my e-mails on every case, you would find\nthat that is hou I communicate with people. I’m a Minnesota girl,\nand I prefer not to be confrontational until I have to be. And I can\nbe when I need to be. But my instructions from my supervisors were\nto engage in these negotiations and to complete them. So I felt that\ngiven that task, the best way to complete them was to reach the\nagreement and, keeping in mind the terms that . . . our office had\nagreed to, and do that in a way that is civil. So... although my\nlanguage in the kind of introductory or prefatory communications\nwith Mr. Lefkouitz was casual and was friendly, when you look at\nthe terms and when he would come back to me asking for changes,\nmy response was always, “No, I will not make that change.”\n\nVillafafia denied any intention to keep the victims uninformed about the NPA or to provide\nan improper benefit for Epstein, and she explained the context of the emails in question. The email\nin which Villafafia expressed reluctance to “highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and all\nof the other persons that we could charge” was writen in response to a defense proposal to include\nin the federal plea agreement the parties were then considering a promise by the government not\nto prosecute Epstein’s assistants and other employees. Lefkouitz had proposed that the plea\nagreement state, “Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also precludes the\ninitiation of any and all criminal charges which might otherwise in the future be brought against\n[four named female assistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity] for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” Villafafia told OPR that\nthe USAO was not intending to charge Epstein’s assistants and was not aware of anyone else who\ncould be charged, and thus did not oppose the request not to prosecute third parties. Houever,\nVillafafia was concerned that an overly detailed federal plea agreement would prompt the court to\nrequire the government to provide further information about the uncharged conduct, which might\nlead Epstein to claim the government breached the agreement by providing information to the\ncourt not directly connected to the charges to which he was pleading guilty. Villafafia was not the\nonly one to express concern about hou deeply a federal court might probe the facts, and whether\nsuch probing would interfere with the viability of a plea agreement. In an earlier email, Lourie\nhad suggested charging Epstein by complaint to allou the USAO more flexibility in plea\nnegotiations and avoid the problem that a court might not accept a plea to a conspiracy charge that\nrequired dismissal of numerous substantive counts.\n\nAs to Villafafia’s offer to meet with Lefkouitz “off campus” to resolve outstanding issues\nin the NPA negotiation, she explained to OPR that she believed a face-to-face meeting at a\n“neutral” location—with “all the necessary decision makers present or ‘on call’”— might facilitate\ncompletion of the negotiations, which had dragged on for some time.\n\nl64\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3366\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003371.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l95 of 348\ninvestigation.7* Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of’ Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?4\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,’ or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\nia See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\na When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\n\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo337l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003375.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l99 of 348\ndepart from the Ashcroft Memo. He told OPR, houever, that he did not recall discussing the\nAshcroft Memo with his colleagues and nothing in the contemporaneous documentary record\nsuggests that he made a conscious decision to depart from it when he decided to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Instead, it appears that Acosta simply failed to consider the tension\nbetween federal charging policy and the strong federal interest in this case, on the one hand, and\nhis broad reading of the Petite policy and his general concerns about “federalism,” on the other\nhand. OPR concludes that Acosta viewed the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\ntoo narrouly and through the wrong prism.\n\nFurthermore, Acosta’s federalism concerns about intruding on the state’s autonomy\nresulted in an outcome—the NPA—that intruded far more on the state’s autonomy than a decision\nto pursue a federal prosecution would have.**” By means of the NPA, the federal government\ndictated to the state the charges, the sentence, the timing, and certain conditions that the state had\nto obtain during the state’s oun prosecution. Acosta acknouledged during his OPR interview that\nhis “atempt to backstop the state here[] rebounded, because in the process, it . . . ended up being\narguably more intrusive.”\n\nAcosta’s concern about invading the state’s authority led to additional negative\nconsequences. Acosta revised the draft NPA in several respects to “soften” its tone, by substituting\nprovisions requiring Epstein to make his “best efforts” for language that appeared to dictate certain\nactions to the state. In so doing, houever, Acosta undermined the enforceability of the agreement,\nmaking it difficult later to declare Epstein in breach when he failed to comply.\n\nOPR found no indication that when deciding to resolve the federal prosecution through a\nmechanism that relied completely on state action, Acosta considered the numerous disadvantages\nof having Epstein plead guilty in the state court system, a system in which none of the subjects had\npracticed and with which they were unfamiliar. Villafafia recognized that there were “a lot of ways\nto manipulate state sentences,” and she told OPR that she was concerned from the outset of\nnegotiations about entering into the NPA, because by sending the case back to the state the USAO\nwas “giving up all control over what was going on.” Villafafia also told OPR that defense counsel\n“had a lot of experience with the state system. We did not.” Epstein’s ability to obtain work\nrelease, a provision directly contrary to the USAO’s intent with respect to Epstein’s sentence, is a\nclear example of the problem faced by the prosecutors when trying to craft a plea that depended\non a judicial system with which they were unfamiliar and over which they had no control.\nAlthough the issue of gain time was considered and addressed in the NPA, none of the subject\natorneys negotiating the NPA realized until after the NPA was signed that Epstein might be\neligible for work release. Acosta, in particular, told OPR that “if it was typical to provide that kind\nof work release in these cases, that would have been news to me.” Because work release was not\nanticipated, the NPA did not specifically address it, and the USAO was unable to foreclose Epstein\nfrom applying for admission to the program.\n\n249 The Petite policy only applies to the Department of Justice and federal prosecutions. It does not prevent state\nauthorities from pursuing state charges after a federal prosecution. See, e.g., United States v. Nichols and State v.\nNichols (dual prosecution for acts commited in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building). Houever, in\npractice and to use their resources most efficiently, state authorities often choose not to pursue state charges if the\nfederal prosecution results in a conviction.\nl73\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3375\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003396.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22o of 348\ninformation about available services for victims.

In particular, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views\nabout, prospective plea negotiations. Nevertheless, the 2oo5 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a conviction. Depending on the agency having custody of the defendant, the U.S.\nAtorney or other agencies were responsible for victim notifications during this stage.\n\nIV.

Villafafia recalled mentioning the conversation to her\nsupervisors and the case agents because she “thought he was somebody who could be of assistance\nto us and... could perhaps persuade Alex Acosta that this was a case that was meritorious and\nshould be prosecuted.”\n\nNevertheless, when OPR asked Villafafia why she did not inform Edwards of the same\ninformation that the FBI and she had provided to Wild in October 2oo7 and January 2oo8,\nVillafafia explained that she felt “prohibited”:\n\nAt the time that I spoke with him, you knou, there had been all of\nthis . . . leter writing or all of these concerns and instructions that I\nhad been given by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose\nthings further and not to have any involvement in victim\nnotification, and so I felt like that prohibited me from telling him\nabout the existence of the NPA.\nX. JUNE 2oo8: EFFORTS TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT THE JUNE 3o, 2oo8 PLEA\n\nHEARING\n\nThe Epstein team’s appeals through the Department ended on June 23, 2oo8, when the\nDeputy Atorney General determined that “federal prosecution of this case is appropriate” and\nEpstein’s allegations of prosecutorial misconduct did not rise to a level that would undermine such\na decision. Immediately thereafter, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that\nEpstein had until “the close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the terms and\nconditions of the agreement . . . including entry of a guilty plea, sentencing, and surrendering to\nbegin his sentence of imprisonment.” That same day, Villafafia made plans to file charges on July\nl, 2oo8, if Epstein did not enter his guilty plea by the June 3o deadline.\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia received a copy of the proposed state plea agreement\nand learned that the plea hearing was scheduled for 8:3o a.m. on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8. Also on\nthat Friday, Villafafia submited to Sloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior a “final final”\nproposed federal indictment of Epstein.\n\nVillafafia and the FBI finalized the government’s victim list that they intended to disclose,\nfor § 2255 purposes, to Epstein after the plea and, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia contacted\nPBPD Chief Reiter to ask him to notify the victims of the plea hearing. Villafafia told OPR that\nSloman said, “Chief Reiter could contact the victims from the state case, and tell them about the\nplea.”**! On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform him that PBPD Chief\nReiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”?>?\n\n3ol Villafafia further stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n352 Sloman replied, “Good.”\n23l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3433\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003439.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 263 of 348\nno federal charges filed against Epstein as a result of the government’s agreement in mid-2oo7 to\ndefer prosecution to the state.>”°\n\nC. July 2oo8: Villafafia Prepares and Sends a Victim Notification Leter to Listed\n\nVictims\n\nOn July 8, 2oo8, Villafafia provided Goldberger with an updated victim list for l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 purposes, noting that she had inadvertently left off one individual in her June 3o, 2oo8\nleter. Villafafia also informed the defense that, beginning the follouing day, she would distribute\nnotifications to each of the 32 victims and their counsel informing them that Epstein’s atorney\nwould be the contact for any civil litigation, if the victim decided to pursue damages. Finally, the\nleter informed the defense that the government would consider a denial by Epstein that any “one\nof these victims is entitled to proceed under l8 U.S.C. § 2255” to be considered a breach of the\nterms of the NPA.\n\nAfter exchanging emails and leters with the defense concerning the content of the notice\nleter, Villafafia drafted a leter she sent, on July 9 and lo, to nine victims who had previously\nretained counsel. The leter informed the victims and their counsel that, “[i]n light of’ Epstein’s\nJune 3o, 2oo8 state court plea to felony solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, and his sentence of a total of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by l2\nmonths’ community control, “the United States has agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of\nthis state plea and sentence, subject to certain conditions.” The leter included a reference to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 provision of the NPA, and although the defense had never agreed to it, used\nlanguage from Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein defense atorney Sanchez clarifying\nthe damages provision. The paragraph belou was described as “[o]ne such <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> to which\nEpstein has agreed”:\n\nAny person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an\noffense enumerated in Title l8, United States Code, Section 2255,\nwill have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she\nwould have had, if Mr. Epstein had been tried federally and\nconvicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing\nthis paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s\natorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to\nname... as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any\njudicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority\ndetermining which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet,\nshall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these\nidentified victims in the same position as they would have been had\nMr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.\n\nOn July lo, 2oo8, Villafafia sent Goldberger a “Final Notification of Identified Victims,”\nhighlighting the defendant’s obligations under the NPA concerning victim lawsuits pursuant to\n37o As described in Section XII.G of this Part, the mater continued in litigation for years and resulted in the\ndistrict court’s February 2l, 2ol9 opinion concluding that the government violated the victims’ rights under the CVRA\nby failing to consult with them before signing the NPA.\n\n237\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3439\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003454.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 278 of 348\n\n(e) If the offender is convicted, the sentence and conditions of supervised\nrelease, if any, that are imposed.\n(6) Referrals.

Consultation With a Government Atorney\n\n(l) In General. A victim has the reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the\nGovernment in the case. The victim’s right to confer, houever, shall not be\nconstrued to impair prosecutorial discretion. Federal prosecutors should be\navailable to consult with victims about major case decisions, such as dismissals,\nrelease of the accused pending judicial proceedings (when such release is for\nnoninvestigative purposes), plea negotiations, and pretrial diversion. Because\nvictims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government, and may disclose\nwhatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only\nnonsensitive data and public information. Consultations should comply with the\nprosecutor’s obligations under applicable rules of professional conduct.\nRepresentatives of the Department should take care to inform victims that neither\nthe Department’s advocacy for victims nor any other effort that the Department\nmay make on their behalf constitutes or creates an atorney-client relationship\nbetween such victims and the lawyers for the Government.\nDepartment personnel should not provide legal advice to victims.\n(2) Prosecutor Availability. Prosecutors should be reasonably available to consult\nwith victims regarding significant adversities they may suffer as a result of delays\nin the prosecution of the case and should, at the appropriate time, inform the court\nof the reasonable concerns that have been conveyed to the prosecutor.\n(3) Proposed Plea Agreements. Responsible officials should make reasonable\nefforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about,\nprospective plea negotiations. In determining what is reasonable, the responsible\nofficial should consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving\nnotice and considering views in the context of the particular case, including, but not\nlimited to, the follouing factors:\n\n(a) The impact on public safety and risks to personal safety.\n\n(b) The number of victims.\n\n(c) Whether time is of the essence in negotiating or entering a proposed plea.\n\n252\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3454\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003455.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 279 of 348\n(d) Whether the proposed plea involves confidential information or conditions.\n(e) Whether there is another need for confidentiality.\n(f) Whether the victim is a possible witness in the case and the effect that\nrelaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.\nI. FLORIDA RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT\n\nA. FRPC 4-4.l — Candor in Dealing with Others\n\nFRPC 4-4.l prohibits a lawyer from knouingly making a false statement of material fact\nor law to a third person during the course of representation of a client. A comment to this rule\nexplains that “[m]isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or\nomissions that are the equivalent of affirmative false statements,” and “[w]hether a particular\nstatement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the circumstances.”\n\nB. FRPC 4-8.4 — Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(c) states that a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,\ndeceit, or misrepresentation.\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(d) prohibits a lawyer from engaging in conduct in connection with the practice\nof law that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\n\nAs previously noted, courts have determined that FRPC 4-8.4(d) is not limited to conduct\nthat occurs in a judicial proceeding, but can be applied to “conduct in connection with the practice\nof law.” Frederick, 756 So. 2d at 87; see also Shankman, 4l So. 3d at l72.\n\n253\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3455\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003500.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 324 of 348\nsignature on this Agreement; and\n\nIT APPEARING, after an investigation of the offenses and Epstein’s background, that\nthe interest of the United States and Epstein’s oun interest and the interest of justice will be\nserved by the follouing procedure;\n\nTHEREFORE, on the authority of R.

No. l42-l at 5. Under Annabi,\nSalameh, and Gonzalez, a statement that “the United States” agrees not to prosecute implies no\nrestriction on prosecutions in other districts.\n\nTwo provisions of the NPA refer specifically to prosecution in the Southern District of\nFlorida. The first states that the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida will defer\n“prosecution in this District” if Epstein complies with the agreement. Dkt. No. l42-l at 2. The\nsecond states that no prosecution “will be instituted in this District, and the charges against\nEpstein if any, will be dismissed” after he fulfills the agreement’s conditions. Maxwell contends\nthat the lack of similar language in the co-conspirator provision must mean that it lacks any\ngeographical limitation.

It is not plausible—let alone “affirmatively\napparent”, Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672,— that the parties intended to drastically expand the\nagreement’s geographic scope in the single sentence on the prosecution of co-conspirators\nwithout clearly so saying.\n\nWithout an affirmative statement in the NPA’s text, Maxwell turns to its negotiation\nhistory. Under Second Circuit precedent she may offer evidence that negotiations of the NPA\nbetween the defendant and the prosecutors included a promise to bind other districts. See United\nStates v. Russo, 8ol F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir. l986). She alleges that officials in the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida sought and obtained approval for the NPA\nfrom the Office of the Deputy Atorney General and communicated with atorneys in other\ndistricts. Any involvement of atorneys outside the Southern District of Florida appears to have\nbeen minimal. Maxwell has already received access to an unusually large amount of information\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3679\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003680.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page6of34\nabout the NPA’s negotiation history in the form of the OPR report and yet identifies no evidence\nthat the Department of Justice made any promises not contained in the NPA. The OPR report\nreflects that the Office of the Deputy Atorney General reviewed the NPA, but only after it was\nsigned when Epstein tried to get out of it. OPR Report at lo3. Other documents shou that\natorneys in the Southern District of Florida reached out to other districts for investigatory\nassistance but not for help negotiating the NPA. Dkt. No. 2o4-2. Nor would direct approval of\nthe NPA by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General change the meaning of its terms. No\nevidence suggests anyone promised Epstein that the NPA would bar the prosecution of his co-\nconspirators in other districts. Absent such a promise, it does not mater who did or did not\napprove it.\n\nSecond Circuit precedent creates a strong presumption that a plea agreement binds only\nthe U.S. Atorney’s office for the district where it was signed. Maxwell identifies nothing in the\nNPA’s text or negotiation history to disturb this presumption. The Court thus concludes that the\nNPA does not bind the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of New York.\n\nB. The non-prosecution agreement does not cover the charged offenses\n\nThe NPA would provide Maxwell no defense to the charges in the Sl superseding\nindictment even against an office bound to follou it. The NPA bars prosecution, follouing\nEpstein’s fulfillment of its conditions, only for three specific categories of offenses:\n\n(l) “the offenses set out on pages l and 2” of the NPA; namely, “any offenses that\n\nmay have been commited by Epstein against the United States from in or around\n\n2ool through in or around September 2oo7” including five enumerated offenses;\n(2) “any other offenses that have been the subject of the joint investigation by the\n\nFederal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Atorney’s Office”; and\n(3) “any offenses that arose from the Federal Grand Jury investigation.”\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo368o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003719.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagellofl6\n\nThe government complains that Ms. Maxwell has not cited any cases where a perjury\ncount was dismissed pretrial for “fundamental ambiguity.” Resp. l2o. Of course, the government\nmust knou that myriad examples exist. United States v. Cicalese, 863 F. Supp. 2d 23l, 236—37\n(E.D.N.Y. 2ol2), is instructive:\n\nSuccinctly, the prosecutor did not fulfill her obligation to “pin the witness doun to\n\nthe specific object of [her] inquiry.” Bronston, 4o9 U.S. at 36o. Any number of\n\nstraightforward follou-up questions could have clarified the object of inquiry. For\n\nexample, in addition to the “atempt” question mentioned earlier, the government\n\ncould have cured the ambiguity by supplying the date, time or location of the target\n\nmeeting, focusing Cicalese's atention on the specific events at\n\nissue. See Razzaia, 37o F.Supp. at 578-79. Left naked, the government's imprecise\n\nquestion did not meet the standard set in Bronston. It cannot provide a jury with\n\na sufficient basis to reasonably conclude that Cicalese willfully lied by answering\n\nas he did. Jd. at 579. Asking simple follou-up questions could have resolved the\n\nimprecision and fulfilled the government's obligation under Bronston. Whether by\n\nstrategy or inadvertence, the government did not do so.\nThe Court granted Cicalese's motion to dismiss the charges against him. /d. at 232.\n\nSimilarly, in United States v. Landau, 737 F. Supp. 778 (S.D.N.Y. l99o), the court\ndismissed a perjury indictment, holding “the context of all the preceding questions and Landau's\ngrand jury testimony as a whole, the prosecutor's questions here are fundamentally ambiguous\nand cannot as a mater of law to support a perjury conviction. Landau's motion is therefore\ngranted and the indictment is dismissed.” /d. at 784-85 (emphasis added). The same is true\nhere. In the context of the questions preceding the selectively quoted testimony in Counts Five\nand Six and the transcripts as a whole, the selected questions were fundamentally ambiguous.\n\nIn United States v. Manapat, 928 F.2d lo97 (llth Cir.l99l), the Eleventh Circuit\naffirmed an acquital on the grounds of fundamental ambiguity as a result of the content of the\nform that was the basis of the prosecution. There, the defendant applied for an Airman Medical\nCertificate to the Federal Aviation Administration. The application included a section entitled\n“Medical History” that contained twenty-four questions regarding “conditions.” The first twenty-\n\n?\nDOJ-OGR-oooo37l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003720.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of l6\none “conditions” questions were all medical in nature. The twenty-second and twenty-third\nquestions, houever, inquired about convictions (one about “traffic convictions,” the other about\n“other convictions”). Manapat answered in the negative to both question twenty-two and\nquestion twenty-three, and these answers became the basis for his prosecution for “knouingly\nand willfully” making false statements to any department or agency of the United States. In\naffirming the district court's decision to dismiss the indictment, the Eleventh Circuit stated:\n\nAlthough the single statements “Record of traffic convictions,” or “Record of other\nconvictions” may not be ambiguous standing alone, they become quite confusing\nwhen buried in a list headed “Medical History” and purportedly concerned with\nmedical conditions.... In order to successfully prosecute an indictment for making\na false statement, the government must not remove questions from the context in\nwhich their answers were given in an atempt to prove their clarity.\nId. at llol.\nAlso helpful is United States v.

Edlind, 887 F.3d l66 (4th Cir. 2ol8), and aff'd, 77o F.\nApp’x 33 (4th Cir. 2ol9), where the court dismissed multiple perjury and false statement claims,\nholding:\nMoreover, it is not perjurious for [the defendant] to give an evasive answer to a\nbroadly-worded question, so long as her response was not false. See United States\nv. Reveron Martinez, 836 F.2d 684, 689 (lst Cir. l988) (“In order to sustain a\nperjury charge, evasions are not enough. The government must shou more than that\nthe interdicted statement was unresponsive or guarded. At a bare minimum, the\nremark must have been literally false.”); United States v. Earp, 8l2 F.2d 9l7, 9l9\n(4th Cir. l987) (“The burden is on the questioner to pin the witness doun to the\nspecific object of the questioner's inquiry.”); United States v.

No\nreasonable juror could conclude otherwise.\nIn United States v. Ruedlinger, 99o F. Supp. l295, l3o3-o4 (D.

In its brief denial\nof her appeal, the Circuit stated: “To the extent Appellant seeks relief specific to her sleeping\nconditions, such request should be addressed to the District Court.” See Exhibit A. We press our\nconcerns regarding disruption of Ms. Maxwell’s sleep and the deleterious effect sleep\ndeprivation is having on her health, well-being, and ability to prepare for and withstand trial.\n\nMs. Maxwell continues to be disrupted throughout the night by guards shining a\nflash/strobe light into her cell, claiming that her breathing must be checked. The myth that Ms.\nMaxwell’s conditions of confinement are related to her being a suicide risk was laid to rest\nduring the oral argument: There is nothing to support that contrived claim. In fact, Ms. Maxwell\nis classified with the standard CCl-Mh designation: inmate with no significant mental health\ncare. (See Dkt. l59 at 3.)\n\nContrary to the report that Ms. Maxwell “wears an eye mask when she sleeps” (Dkt. l96\nat 4), an item neither available for purchase through MDC commissary nor provided to her, she\nresorts to using a sock or touel to cover her eyes in an awkward atempt to shield them from\ndisrupting illumination every l5 minutes. Last night, she was confronted by MDC staff due a\nvisible bruise over her left eye. The “black eye” is depicted in Exhibit B. Despite 24/7 camera\nsurveillance (except when guards elect to exert authority in an intimidating way off-camera, as\nthey did in Saturday’s bathroom incident), no guard addressed the bruise until Ms. Maxwell, who\nhas no mirror, caught a reflection of her aching eye in the glean of a nail clipper. At that point,\nMDC staff confronted Ms. Maxwell regarding the source of the bruise, threatening to place her\nin the SHU if she did not reveal hou she got it. While Ms. Maxwell is unaware of the cause of\nthe bruise, as reported to medical and psych staff, she has groun increasingly reluctant to report\ninformation to the guards for fear of retaliation, discipline, and punitive chores. Houever, there\nis concern that the bruise may be related to the need for Ms. Maxwell to shield her eyes from the\nlights projected into her cell throughout the night.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o54\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004055.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 256 Filed o4/29/2l Page2of4\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\nDuring oral argument of Ghislaine Maxwell’s bail appeal before the Circuit, Ms.\nMaxwell’s appellate counsel expressed concern that she was improperly deprived of sleep while\ndetained in the MDC, an issue that has been raised in filings before this Court. In its brief denial\nof her appeal, the Circuit stated: “To the extent Appellant seeks relief specific to her sleeping\nconditions, such request should be addressed to the District Court.” See Exhibit A. We press our\nconcerns regarding disruption of Ms. Maxwell’s sleep and the deleterious effect sleep\ndeprivation is having on her health, well-being, and ability to prepare for and withstand trial.\nMs. Maxwell continues to be disrupted throughout the night by guards shining a\nflash/strobe light into her cell, claiming that her breathing must be checked. The myth that Ms.\nMaxwell’s conditions of confinement are related to her being a suicide risk was laid to rest\nduring the oral argument: There is nothing to support that contrived claim. In fact, Ms. Maxwell\nis classified with the standard CCl-Mh designation: inmate with no significant mental health\ncare. (See Dkt. l59 at 3.)\nContrary to the report that Ms. Maxwell “wears an eye mask when she sleeps” (Dkt. l96\nat 4), an item neither available for purchase through MDC commissary nor provided to her, she\nresorts to using a sock or touel to cover her eyes in an awkward atempt to shield them from\ndisrupting illumination every l5 minutes. Last night, she was confronted by MDC staff due a\nvisible bruise over her left eye. The “black eye” is depicted in Exhibit B. Despite 24/7 camera\nsurveillance (except when guards elect to exert authority in an intimidating way off-camera, as\nthey did in Saturday’s bathroom incident), no guard addressed the bruise until Ms. Maxwell, who\nhas no mirror, caught a reflection of her aching eye in the glean of a nail clipper. At that point,\nMDC staff confronted Ms. Maxwell regarding the source of the bruise, threatening to place her\nin the SHU if she did not reveal hou she got it. While Ms. Maxwell is unaware of the cause of\nthe bruise, as reported to medical and psych staff, she has groun increasingly reluctant to report\ninformation to the guards for fear of retaliation, discipline, and punitive chores. Houever, there\nis concern that the bruise may be related to the need for Ms. Maxwell to shield her eyes from the\nlights projected into her cell throughout the night.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o58\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004059.jpg": "Ceast: 2@2orOCRRSPAGN Domuwmeant2Z>6 AbeOek22922l Patra fof 2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

NATHAN, District Judge:\nOn April 29, 2o2l, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell wrote to the Court requesting that the\nCourt address her sleeping conditions, with particular emphasis on counsel’s representation,\nunsupported by affidavit or other factual shouing, that guards are shining a flashlight in\nMaxwell’s eyes every l5 minutes at night.

The Court sought more information by ordering the\nGovernment to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to certain\nquestions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff conduct flashlight\nchecks of all inmates as a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As reported by the Government,\ninmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing Unit are checked with flashlights every\n3o minutes. Inmates housed with others in the general population are checked multiple times per\nnight at regular intervals. The Government further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights\nare pointed at the ceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in\ndistress. As the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP’s\nflashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates, including\nthat Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential stress for inmates that\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4l3o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004259.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 29l Filed o5/2l/2l Page9ofl3\nPage 9\n\nof the fact that some accusers have spoken publicly about this case. The government’s\nprincipal justification for withholding their identities until September l3 is that earlier\ndisclosure would be inconsistent with the “practice” of the office. This is not a sufficient\nreason to withhold this information where any investigation of these accusers has to take place\nunder the onerous conditions of COVID.\n\nDefendant's Proposal for Disclosure of Jencks Act/35oo and Giglio Material, Rule 4o4(b)\nEvidence and Notice, and Government Witness and Exhibit Lists\n\nThe defense believes that shifting the deadlines up two weeks for motions in limine to\nbe fully briefed four weeks prior to trial (Dkt. 277) necessitates a concomitant two week\nadvancement of the dates for the government to produce Jencks Act/35oo and Giglio material,\nRule 4o4(b) evidence and notice, and the government's witness and exhibit lists.\n\nThe government’s proposal allous only one week for the defense to review thousands\nof pages of 35oo material before filing motions in /imine, and the government proposes\ndisclosing its exhibit and witness lists one week after the in limine deadline. As discussed at\nthe April 23d arraignment, the defense needs sufficient time in advance of the in limine\ndeadline to review the materials and draft the appropriate motions.*- The government's\nproposed process will frustrate the Court's aim of having in /imine issues briefed four weeks\nin advance of trial to the extent possible.\n\nThe cases cited by the government in which disclosures were made closer to trial are\nwholly inapposite. In each of the cited cases, charges were filed nearly contemporaneously\nwith the alleged crimes.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.?> The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

At\nthis point, Sloman left on vacation, and he informed Acosta and Villafafia that in his absence\nLourie had agreed “to help finalize this.” Lourie spent the follouing work week at his new post\nat the Department in Washington, D.C., but communicated with his USAO colleagues by phone\nand email.\n\nIn a Sunday, September l6, 2oo7 email, Villafafia informed Lefkouitz that she had drafted\na factual proffer to accompany a revised “hybrid” federal plea proposal. In that email, Villafafia\nalso noted that she was considering filing charges in the federal district court in Miami, “which\nwill hopefully cut the press coverage significantly.” This email received considerable atention l2\nyears later when it was made public during the CVRA litigation and was viewed as evidence of\nthe USAO’s efforts to conceal the NPA from the victims. Villafafia, houever, explained to OPR\nthat she was concerned that news media coverage would violate the victims’ privacy. She told\nOPR, “[I]f [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into\nthe courthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper,” and that such publicity\nwas less likely to happen in Miami, where the press “in general does not care about what happens\nin Palm Beach.”\n\nLefkouitz responded to Villafafia with a revised version of her latest proposed “hybrid”\nplea agreement, in a document entitled “Agreement.” Significantly, this defense proposal\nintroduced two new provisions. The first related to four female assistants who had allegedly\nfacilitated Epstein in his criminal scheme. The defense sought a government promise not to\nprosecute them, as well as certain other unnamed Epstein employees, and a promise to forego\nimmigration proceedings against two of the female assistants:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also\n\nprecludes the initiation of any and all criminal charges which might\n\notherwise in the future be brought against [four named female\n\nassistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate\n\nentity] for any criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal\n\ninvestigation . . . . Further, no immigration proceeding will be\n\ninstituted against [two named female assistants] as a result of the\n\nongoing investigation.\n\nThe second new provision related to the USAO’s efforts to obtain Epstein’s computers:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement\n\nresolves any and all outstanding [legal process] that have requested\n\nwitness testimony and/or the production of documents and/or\n\ncomputers in relation to the investigation that is the subject of the\n\nAgreement.

Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year conspiracy\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding recommendation for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\nsentenced in the state after he is sentenced in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be sentenced after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the resolution of all criminal liability, ‘and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she understood\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.!'?\n\nWith regard to immigration, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on immigration issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in connection with\ntheir immigration paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status. So there wasn’t any reason\nM3 OPR understood Villafafia’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry\ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to\ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4394\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004422.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l25 of 349\nthe defense “[f]irst and foremost” reaffirmed the NPA and that Epstein “has no intention of\nunwinding the agreement.”\n\nOn December 7, 2oo7—the deadline set by Acosta in his December 4, 2oo7 leter to Starr—\nthe defense transmited to the USAO a one-sentence “Affirmation” of the NPA and its addendum,\nsigned by Epstein. !™4\n\nF.

In one submission, 2o pages long, Lefkouitz\naddressed the “improper involvement” of federal authorities in the investigation and criticized\nVillafafia for a number of alleged improprieties, including having engaged in “unprecedented\nfederal overreaching” by seeking to prosecute Epstein federally, “insist[ing]” that the State\nAtorney’s Office “charge Mr. Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are\nsignificantly harsher than what the State deemed appropriate,” and requiring that Epstein plead\nguilty to a registrable offense, a “harsh” <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> that was “unwarranted.” !*°\n\nLefkouitz also argued that the federal investigation relied upon a state investigation that\nwas “tainted” by the lead PBPD Detective’s misrepresentation of key facts in affidavits and\ninterview summaries, leading the USAO to make its charging decision based on flawed\ninformation that “compromised the federal investigation.” Finally, Lefkouitz criticized federal\ninvolvement in the state plea process as a violation of “the tenets of the Petite Policy.” In a second,\nl3-page submission, Lefkouitz reiterated Epstein’s complaints about the § 2255 component of the\nNPA, arguing, among other things, that federal prosecutors “should not be in the business of\nhelping alleged victims of state crimes secure civil financial setlements.”\n\nl8 The Affirmation read: “I, Jeffrey E.

He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being sentenced, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence. On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls. Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try\nto take a further appeal in order to delay resolution of the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknouledging they had reached “the\nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While Iam obviously very unhappy at what I believe\nis the government’s treatment of my client, aman whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize\nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost. ... I would like to have .. . some\nclosure with you on this mater so that in the years to come, neither of us will harbor any ill will\nover the mater.”\n\nX. JUNE 2oo8 — JUNE 2oo9: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS PLEAS AND SERVES HIS\n\nCUSTODIAL SENTENCE\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia renewed her requests to Epstein’s local atorneys\nGoldberger and Black for a copy of the state plea agreement reached with the State Atorney’s\nOffice, noting that their failure to provide it was a material breach of the NPA. After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.’”!””\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\n\nV2 The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

Finally, Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s purported “supervisor’—who as the\nFoundation’s vice president was subordinate to Epstein, the Foundation’s president—had\npromised to alert the Sheriff's Office if Epstein failed to comply with his work schedule, but the\n“supervisor” lived and worked in the New York metropolitan area and was unable to monitor\nEpstein’s activities on a day-to-day basis. The Sheriff's Office neither acknouledged nor\nresponded to Villafafia’s leter.\n\nIn March 2oo9, Sloman met in Miami with Dershouitz for, as Dershouitz characterized it\nin a subsequent email, ‘a relaxed drink and conversation,” which included a discussion of the\nEpstein case. After that encounter, Dershouitz emailed Sloman, expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “assurance that the feds will not interfere with hou the Palm Beach sheriff administers”\nEpstein’s sentence “as long as he is treated like any similarly situated inmate.” Sloman responded:\n\nRegarding Mr. Epstein, the United States Atorney’s Office will not\ninterfere with hou the Palm Beach Sheriffs Office administers the\nsentence imposed by the Court. That being said, this does not mean\nthat the USAO condones or encourages the PBSO to mitigate the\nterms and conditions of his sentence. Furthermore, it does not mean\nthat, if contacted for our position concerning alternative custody or\nin-home detention, we would not object. To be clear, if contacted\nwe will object. Naturally, I also expect that no one on behalf of\nMr. Epstein will use my assurance to you to affirmatively represent\nto PBSO that the USAO does not object to an alternative custody or\nhome detention.\n\nA week later, Dershouitz emailed Sloman again, this time expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “willingness to call the sheriff and advise him that your office would take no position\non hou he handled Epstein’s sentence,” as long as Epstein did not receive special treatment, but\nadding, “[L]et’s put any call off for a while.”\n\nEpstein’s sentence required that he be confined to his home for a l2-month period\nfollouing his release from prison. On July 22, 2oo9, almost l3 months after he began serving his\nsentence, Epstein was released from the Stockade and placed on home confinement.!® At this\ntime, he registered as a sexual offender.\n\nXI. POST-RELEASE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nIn the summer of 2oo9, allegations surfaced that Epstein had cooperated with the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York’s investigation of investment bank Bear\nStearns, and that he had been released early from his l8-month imprisonment term because of that\nl85 In Florida, what is commonly referred to as house arrest is actually the Community Control supervision\nprogram.

Whatever the reason,\n\nwhen it appears that the Federal interest in prosecution is less\n\nsubstantial than the interest of state or local authorities,\n\nconsideration should be given to referring the case to those\n\nauthorities rather than commencing or recommending a Federal\n\nprosecution.\nAnother comment cautions that in assessing whether to defer to state or local authorities, “the\nFederal prosecutor should be alert to any local conditions, atitudes, relationships or other\ncircumstances that might cast doubt on the likelihood of the state or local authorities conducting a\nthorough and successful prosecution.”\n\nUSAM § 9-27.26o identifies impermissible considerations relating to the decision whether\nto initiate or decline a federal prosecution.

When\nopting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision\nare communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files. USAM § 9-27.27o.\n\n2. USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°? The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist. The prerequisites are as follous:\n\n(l) The mater must involve a substantial federal interest. The determination whether\n\na substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis. Maters\nl92 See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22, 27-29 (l977); Petite v.

In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\n\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\n\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\n\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\n\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\n\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\n\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\nerm, “*\n\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)(), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\n\nC. Case Law\n\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\n\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\n\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo445l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004488.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l9l of 349\n\nOPR asked Villafafia about these emails and about the tenor of her interactions with\nLefkouitz during the NPA negotiations and with other defense atorneys generally. Villafafia\nacknouledged that their tone was collegial and collaborative, and explained that generally, the\ntone of these emails reflected her personality and her commitment to complete the task her\nsupervisors had assigned to her:\n\n[I|f you were to pull all my e-mails on every case, you would find\nthat that is hou I communicate with people. I’m a Minnesota girl,\nand I prefer not to be confrontational until I have to be. And I can\nbe when I need to be. But my instructions from my supervisors were\nto engage in these negotiations and to complete them. So I felt that\ngiven that task, the best way to complete them was to reach the\nagreement and, keeping in mind the terms that . . . our office had\nagreed to, and do that in a way that is civil. So... although my\nlanguage in the kind of introductory or prefatory communications\nwith Mr. Lefkouitz was casual and was friendly, when you look at\nthe terms and when he would come back to me asking for changes,\nmy response was always, “No, I will not make that change.”\n\nVillafafia denied any intention to keep the victims uninformed about the NPA or to provide\nan improper benefit for Epstein, and she explained the context of the emails in question. The email\nin which Villafafia expressed reluctance to “highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and all\nof the other persons that we could charge” was writen in response to a defense proposal to include\nin the federal plea agreement the parties were then considering a promise by the government not\nto prosecute Epstein’s assistants and other employees. Lefkouitz had proposed that the plea\nagreement state, “Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also precludes the\ninitiation of any and all criminal charges which might otherwise in the future be brought against\n[four named female assistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity] for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” Villafafia told OPR that\nthe USAO was not intending to charge Epstein’s assistants and was not aware of anyone else who\ncould be charged, and thus did not oppose the request not to prosecute third parties. Houever,\nVillafafia was concerned that an overly detailed federal plea agreement would prompt the court to\nrequire the government to provide further information about the uncharged conduct, which might\nlead Epstein to claim the government breached the agreement by providing information to the\ncourt not directly connected to the charges to which he was pleading guilty. Villafafia was not the\nonly one to express concern about hou deeply a federal court might probe the facts, and whether\nsuch probing would interfere with the viability of a plea agreement. In an earlier email, Lourie\nhad suggested charging Epstein by complaint to allou the USAO more flexibility in plea\nnegotiations and avoid the problem that a court might not accept a plea to a conspiracy charge that\nrequired dismissal of numerous substantive counts.\n\nAs to Villafafia’s offer to meet with Lefkouitz “off campus” to resolve outstanding issues\nin the NPA negotiation, she explained to OPR that she believed a face-to-face meeting at a\n“neutral” location—with “all the necessary decision makers present or ‘on call’”— might facilitate\ncompletion of the negotiations, which had dragged on for some time.\n\nl64\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4488\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004493.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l96 of 349\ninvestigation.7* Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of” Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?4\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,’ or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\nia See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\na When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\n\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4493\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004497.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2oo of 349\ndepart from the Ashcroft Memo. He told OPR, houever, that he did not recall discussing the\nAshcroft Memo with his colleagues and nothing in the contemporaneous documentary record\nsuggests that he made a conscious decision to depart from it when he decided to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Instead, it appears that Acosta simply failed to consider the tension\nbetween federal charging policy and the strong federal interest in this case, on the one hand, and\nhis broad reading of the Petite policy and his general concerns about “federalism,” on the other\nhand. OPR concludes that Acosta viewed the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\ntoo narrouly and through the wrong prism.\n\nFurthermore, Acosta’s federalism concerns about intruding on the state’s autonomy\nresulted in an outcome—the NPA—that intruded far more on the state’s autonomy than a decision\nto pursue a federal prosecution would have.**? By means of the NPA, the federal government\ndictated to the state the charges, the sentence, the timing, and certain conditions that the state had\nto obtain during the state’s oun prosecution. Acosta acknouledged during his OPR interview that\nhis “atempt to backstop the state here[] rebounded, because in the process, it... ended up being\narguably more intrusive.”\n\nAcosta’s concern about invading the state’s authority led to additional negative\nconsequences. Acosta revised the draft NPA in several respects to “soften” its tone, by substituting\nprovisions requiring Epstein to make his “best efforts” for language that appeared to dictate certain\nactions to the state. In so doing, houever, Acosta undermined the enforceability of the agreement,\nmaking it difficult later to declare Epstein in breach when he failed to comply.\n\nOPR found no indication that when deciding to resolve the federal prosecution through a\nmechanism that relied completely on state action, Acosta considered the numerous disadvantages\nof having Epstein plead guilty in the state court system, a system in which none of the subjects had\npracticed and with which they were unfamiliar. Villafafia recognized that there were “a lot of ways\nto manipulate state sentences,” and she told OPR that she was concerned from the outset of\nnegotiations about entering into the NPA, because by sending the case back to the state the USAO\nwas “giving up all control over what was going on.” Villafafia also told OPR that defense counsel\n“had a lot of experience with the state system. We did not.” Epstein’s ability to obtain work\nrelease, a provision directly contrary to the USAO’s intent with respect to Epstein’s sentence, is a\nclear example of the problem faced by the prosecutors when trying to craft a plea that depended\non a judicial system with which they were unfamiliar and over which they had no control.\nAlthough the issue of gain time was considered and addressed in the NPA, none of the subject\natorneys negotiating the NPA realized until after the NPA was signed that Epstein might be\neligible for work release. Acosta, in particular, told OPR that “if it was typical to provide that kind\nof work release in these cases, that would have been news to me.” Because work release was not\nanticipated, the NPA did not specifically address it, and the USAO was unable to foreclose Epstein\nfrom applying for admission to the program.\n\n249 The Petite policy only applies to the Department of Justice and federal prosecutions. It does not prevent state\nauthorities from pursuing state charges after a federal prosecution. See, e.g., United States v. Nichols and State v.\nNichols (dual prosecution for acts commited in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building). Houever, in\npractice and to use their resources most efficiently, state authorities often choose not to pursue state charges if the\nfederal prosecution results in a conviction.\nl73\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4497\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004518.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 22l of 349\ninformation about available services for victims.

The 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to “provide the victim with reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding . . . that involves the crime against the victim.”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult\nwith victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea\nnegotiations, and pretrial diversion. In particular, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views\nabout, prospective plea negotiations. Nevertheless, the 2oo5 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a conviction. Depending on the agency having custody of the defendant, the U.S.\nAtorney or other agencies were responsible for victim notifications during this stage.\n\nIV.

Immediately thereafter, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that\nEpstein had until “the close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the terms and\nconditions of the agreement . . . including entry of a guilty plea, sentencing, and surrendering to\nbegin his sentence of imprisonment.” That same day, Villafafia made plans to file charges on July\nl, 2oo8, if Epstein did not enter his guilty plea by the June 3o deadline.\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia received a copy of the proposed state plea agreement\nand learned that the plea hearing was scheduled for 8:3o a.m. on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8. Also on\nthat Friday, Villafafia submited to Sloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior a “final final”\nproposed federal indictment of Epstein.\n\nVillafafia and the FBI finalized the government’s victim list that they intended to disclose,\nfor § 2255 purposes, to Epstein after the plea and, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia contacted\nPBPD Chief Reiter to ask him to notify the victims of the plea hearing. Villafafia told OPR that\nSloman said, “Chief Reiter could contact the victims from the state case, and tell them about the\nplea.”*>! On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform him that PBPD Chief\nReiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”?>?\n\n3ol Villafafia further stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n352 Sloman replied, “Good.”\n23l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4555\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004561.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 264 of 349\nno federal charges filed against Epstein as a result of the government’s agreement in mid-2oo7 to\ndefer prosecution to the state.>”°\n\nC. July 2oo8: Villafafia Prepares and Sends a Victim Notification Leter to Listed\n\nVictims\n\nOn July 8, 2oo8, Villafafia provided Goldberger with an updated victim list for l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 purposes, noting that she had inadvertently left off one individual in her June 3o, 2oo8\nleter. Villafafia also informed the defense that, beginning the follouing day, she would distribute\nnotifications to each of the 32 victims and their counsel informing them that Epstein’s atorney\nwould be the contact for any civil litigation, if the victim decided to pursue damages. Finally, the\nleter informed the defense that the government would consider a denial by Epstein that any “one\nof these victims is entitled to proceed under l8 U.S.C. § 2255” to be considered a breach of the\nterms of the NPA.\n\nAfter exchanging emails and leters with the defense concerning the content of the notice\nleter, Villafafia drafted a leter she sent, on July 9 and lo, to nine victims who had previously\nretained counsel. The leter informed the victims and their counsel that, “[i]n light of’ Epstein’s\nJune 3o, 2oo8 state court plea to felony solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, and his sentence of a total of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by l2\nmonths’ community control, “the United States has agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of\nthis state plea and sentence, subject to certain conditions.” The leter included a reference to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 provision of the NPA, and although the defense had never agreed to it, used\nlanguage from Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein defense atorney Sanchez clarifying\nthe damages provision. The paragraph belou was described as “[o]ne such <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> to which\nEpstein has agreed”:\n\nAny person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an\noffense enumerated in Title l8, United States Code, Section 2255,\nwill have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she\nwould have had, if Mr. Epstein had been tried federally and\nconvicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing\nthis paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s\natorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to\nname... as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any\njudicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority\ndetermining which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet,\nshall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these\nidentified victims in the same position as they would have been had\nMr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.\n\nOn July lo, 2oo8, Villafafia sent Goldberger a “Final Notification of Identified Victims,”\nhighlighting the defendant’s obligations under the NPA concerning victim lawsuits pursuant to\n37o As described in Section XII.G of this Part, the mater continued in litigation for years and resulted in the\ndistrict court’s February 2l, 2ol9 opinion concluding that the government violated the victims’ rights under the CVRA\nby failing to consult with them before signing the NPA.\n\n237\nDOJ-OGR-oooo456l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004576.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 279 of 349\n\n(e) If the offender is convicted, the sentence and conditions of supervised\nrelease, if any, that are imposed.\n(6) Referrals.

Consultation With a Government Atorney\n\n(l) In General. A victim has the reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the\nGovernment in the case. The victim’s right to confer, houever, shall not be\nconstrued to impair prosecutorial discretion. Federal prosecutors should be\navailable to consult with victims about major case decisions, such as dismissals,\nrelease of the accused pending judicial proceedings (when such release is for\nnoninvestigative purposes), plea negotiations, and pretrial diversion. Because\nvictims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government, and may disclose\nwhatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only\nnonsensitive data and public information. Consultations should comply with the\nprosecutor’s obligations under applicable rules of professional conduct.\nRepresentatives of the Department should take care to inform victims that neither\nthe Department’s advocacy for victims nor any other effort that the Department\nmay make on their behalf constitutes or creates an atorney-client relationship\nbetween such victims and the lawyers for the Government.\nDepartment personnel should not provide legal advice to victims.\n(2) Prosecutor Availability. Prosecutors should be reasonably available to consult\nwith victims regarding significant adversities they may suffer as a result of delays\nin the prosecution of the case and should, at the appropriate time, inform the court\nof the reasonable concerns that have been conveyed to the prosecutor.\n(3) Proposed Plea Agreements. Responsible officials should make reasonable\nefforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about,\nprospective plea negotiations. In determining what is reasonable, the responsible\nofficial should consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving\nnotice and considering views in the context of the particular case, including, but not\nlimited to, the follouing factors:\n\n(a) The impact on public safety and risks to personal safety.\n\n(b) The number of victims.\n\n(c) Whether time is of the essence in negotiating or entering a proposed plea.\n\n252\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4576\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004577.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 28o of 349\n(d) Whether the proposed plea involves confidential information or conditions.\n(e) Whether there is another need for confidentiality.\n(f) Whether the victim is a possible witness in the case and the effect that\nrelaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.\nI. FLORIDA RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT\n\nA. FRPC 4-4.l — Candor in Dealing with Others\n\nFRPC 4-4.l prohibits a lawyer from knouingly making a false statement of material fact\nor law to a third person during the course of representation of a client. A comment to this rule\nexplains that “[m]isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or\nomissions that are the equivalent of affirmative false statements,” and “[w]hether a particular\nstatement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the circumstances.”\n\nB. FRPC 4-8.4 — Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(c) states that a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,\ndeceit, or misrepresentation.\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(d) prohibits a lawyer from engaging in conduct in connection with the practice\nof law that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\n\nAs previously noted, courts have determined that FRPC 4-8.4(d) is not limited to conduct\nthat occurs in a judicial proceeding, but can be applied to “conduct in connection with the practice\nof law.” Frederick, 756 So. 2d at 87; see also Shankman, 4l So. 3d at l72.\n\n253\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4577\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004622.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 325 of 349\nsignature on this Agreement; and\n\nIT APPEARING, after an investigation of the offenses and Epstein’s background, that\nthe interest of the United States and Epstein’s oun interest and the interest of justice will be\nserved by the follouing procedure;\n\nTHEREFORE, on the authority of R.

This leter, like the ones\nbefore it, contains second- and third-hand information and presents a one-sided review, giving\nthe Court and the public the false impression that Ms. Maxwell is detained under favorable and\nprivileged conditions. Each time, the defense feels compelled to respond to give the Court and\nthe public a complete and accurate picture of Ms. Maxwell’s unacceptable conditions of\nconfinement. This is not the purpose that these updates were designed to serve. Accordingly,\nthe defense requests that any further updates be limited to changed circumstances.\n\nCounsel for Ms. Maxwell can personally atest to many problems that are not reported to\nthe government, not conveyed to the Court, and not docketed for public review. The follouing is\na sample of new and recurring problems:\n\n= Last week, raw sewage permeated Ms. Maxwell’s isolation cell, necessitating her\nremoval to another cell.\n\n= Vermin droppings fell from air vents.\n\n= Guards nou prevent Ms. Maxwell from removing legal documents from the\n\nvideoconferencing room for review during the lunch hour.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4744\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004746.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3oo _ Filed o6/l5/2l Page 3 of 32\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

He later testified that he did not have any specific\nrecollection of discussing his legal analysis with Ms. Ferman, but would be\nsurprised if he did not.\n\nMr. Castor testified that he could not recall any other case where he made\nthis type of binding legal analysis in Montgomery County. He testified that\nin a half dozen cases during his tenure in the District Atorney’s office,\nsomeone would atempt to assert the Fifth Amendment in a preexisting civil\ncase. The judge in that case would then call Mr. Castor to determine if he\nintended to prosecute the person asserting the privilege. He could confirm\nthat he did not and the claim of privilege would be denied. Mr. Castor was\nunable to name a case in which this happened.\n\nAfter making his decision not to prosecute, Mr. Castor personally issued a\nsecond, signed press release on February l7, 2oo5. Mr. Castor testified\nthat he signed the press release at the request of Ms. Constand’s atorneys\nin order to bind the Commonwealth so it “would be evidence that they could\nshou to a civil judge that Cosby is not geting prosecuted.” The press\nrelease stated, “After reviewing the above and consulting with County and\nCheltenham Detectives, the District Atorney finds insufficient, credible and\nadmissible evidence exists upon which any charge against Mr. Cosby could\nbe sustained beyond a reasonable doubt.” Mr. Castor testified that this\nlanguage made it absolute that [Cosby] would never be prosecuted, “[s]o |\nused the present tense, [exists], .. . So I’m making it absolute. | said |\nfound that there was no evidence—there was insufficient credible and\nadmissible evidence in existence upon which any charge against [Cosby]\ncould be sustained.

Mr.\nCastor testified that this sentence was meant to advise the parties that if\nthey criticized his decision, he would contact the media and explain that Ms.\nConstand’s actions damaged her credibility, which would severely hamper\nher civil case. He testified that once he was certain a prosecution was not\nviable “| operated under the certainty that a civil suit was coming and set up\nthe dominoes to fall in such a way that Mr. Cosby would be required to\ntestify.” He included the language “much exists in this investigation that\ncould be used by others to portray persons on both sides of the issue in a\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4834\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004872.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 6o of 8o\ntraditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental and that defines\nthe community’s sense of fair play and decency.” Commonwealth v. Kratsas, 764 A.2d\n2o, 27 (Pa. 2ool) (cleaned up). Due process is a universal concept, permeating all\naspects of the criminal justice system. Like other state actors, prosecutors must act within\nthe boundaries set by our foundational charters. Thus, we discern no cause or reason,\nlet alone any compelling one, to waive the prosecution’s duty to comply with due process\nsimply because the act at issue is an exercise of discretion, e.g., whether or not to charge\na particular suspect with a crime.\n\nThat is not to say that each and every exercise of prosecutorial discretion with\nregard to charging decisions invites a due process challenge. Charging decisions inhere\nwithin the vast discretion afforded to prosecutors and are generally subject to review only\nfor arbitrary abuses. A prosecutor can choose to prosecute, or not. A prosecutor can\nselect the charges to pursue, and omit from a complaint or bill of information those\ncharges that he or she does not believe are warranted or viable on the facts of the case.\nA prosecutor can also <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> his or her decision not to prosecute a defendant. For\ninstance, a prosecutor can decide initially not to prosecute, subject to possible receipt or\ndiscovery of new inculpatory evidence. Or, a prosecutor can choose not to prosecute the\ndefendant at the present time, but may inform the defendant that the decision is not final\nand that the prosecutor may change his or her mind within the period prescribed by the\napplicable statute of limitations. Similarly, there may be barriers to a prosecution, such\nas the unavailability of a witness or evidence, which subsequently may be removed, thus\nenabling a prosecution to proceed. Generally, no due process violation arises from these\nspecies of discretionary decision-making, and a defendant is without recourse to seek the\nenforcement of any assurances under such circumstances.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 59\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4872\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004875.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 63 of 8o\ncircumstances, implicated Cosby’s due process rights, former D.A. Castor’s post-hoc\natempts to explain or characterize his actions are largely immaterial. The answer to our\nquery lies instead in the objectively indisputable evidence of record demonstrating D.A.\nCastor’s patent intent to induce Cosby’s reliance upon the non-prosecution decision.\n\nIn January and February of 2oo5, then-D.A. Castor led an investigation into\nConstand’s allegations. When that investigation concluded, Mr. Castor decided that the\ncase was saddled with deficiencies such that proving Cosby’s guilt beyond a reasonable\ndoubt was unlikely, if not impossible. For those reasons, D.A. Castor decided not to\nprosecute Cosby. To announce his decision, the district atorney elected to issue a signed\npress release—an uncommon tactic in the typical case, but not necessarily so in cases\nof high public profile or interest.\n\nIn that press statement, D.A. Castor explained the extent and nature of the\ninvestigation and the legal rules and principles that he considered. He then announced\nthat he was declining to prosecute Cosby. The decision was not conditioned in any way,\nshape, or form. D.A. Castor did not say that he would re-evaluate this decision at a future\ndate, that the investigation would continue, or that his decision was subject to being\noverturned by any future district atorney.\n\nThere is nothing from a reasonable observer’s perspective to suggest that the\ndecision was anything but permanent. The trial court found contrary indicia in the later\nportion of the press release, where Mr. Castor “cautioned all parties to this mater that\n[District Atorney Castor] will reconsider this decision should the need arise,” Press\nRelease, 2/l7/2oo5; N.T., 2/2/2ol6, Exh.

New Jersey, 385 U.S.\n493, 5oo (l967)). To ensure that these fundamental freedoms are “scrupulously\nobserved,” we emphasized that “it is the duty of courts to be watchful for the constitutional\nrights of the citizen, and against any stealthy encroachments thereon,” id. at lo63-64\n(quoting Boyd v. United States, ll6 U.S. 6l6, 635 (l886)), and that “the Fifth Amendment\nis to be “broad[ly] constru[ed] in favor of the right which it was intended to secure.” /d. at\nlo64 (quoting Counselman v.

We stressed that “[t]he value\nof constitutional privileges is largely destroyed if persons can be penalized for relying on\nthem.” /d. at lo64 (quoting Grunewald v.

It\n26 To that end, the application of the privilege against self-incrimination is not limited\nto criminal maters. Its availability “does not turn upon the type of proceeding in which its\nprotection is invoked, but upon the nature of the statement or admission and the exposure\nwhich it invites.” /d. (quoting Application of Gault, 387 U.S. l, 49 (l967)). “The privilege\nmay, for example, be claimed in a civil or administrative proceeding, if the statement is or\nmay be inculpatory.” Gault, 387 U.S. at 49.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 65\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4878\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004888.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 76 of 8o\notherwise cooperating with the government to his detriment, due process requires that\nthe prosecutor's promise be fulfilled). In light of the extent and duration of Cosby’s\nreliance, induced as intended by then-District Atorney Castor, no other remedy will do.\nAnything less under these circumstances would permit the Commonwealth to extract\nincriminating evidence from a defendant who relies upon the elected prosecutor’s words,\nactions, and intent, and then use that evidence against that defendant with impunity.\n\nThe circumstances before us here are rare, if not entirely unique. While this\ncontroversy shares some features of earlier cases that contemplate the constitutional role\nof prosecutors, that import contract principles into the criminal law, and that address the\nbinding nature of prosecutorial promises in plea agreements and in other situations—as\nwell as breaches of those promises—there are no precedents directly on point that would\nmake the remedy question an easy one. As the concurring and dissenting opinion\n(“CDO”) observes, the circumstances of this case present a “constellation of . . . unusual\nconditions.”2° It is not at all surprising, then, that a reasonable disagreement arises\nregarding the remedy that must be afforded for what we and the CDO agree was a\nviolation of Cosby’s due process rights.\n\nIn our respectful judgment, the CDO’s proposed remedy, a third criminal trial of\nCosby—albeit one without his deposition testimony—falls short of the relief necessary to\nremedy the constitutional violation. Specific performance is rarely warranted, and should\nbe imposed only when fairness and equity demand it. As the CDO notes, such a remedy\ngenerally should be afforded only under “drastic circumstances where the defendant\ndetrimentally relies on an inducement and cannot be returned to the status quo ante.”°°\n29 See CDO at 4.\n\n#o Id. at 9.\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4888\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004892.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 8o of 8o\nCommonwealth v. DiPasquale, 246 A.2d 43o, 432 (Pa. l968)). The decision to charge,\nor not to charge, a defendant can be conditioned, modified, or revoked at the discretion\nof the prosecutor.\n\nHouever, the discretion vested in our Commonwealth’s prosecutors, houever\nvast, does not mean that its exercise is free of the constraints of due process. When an\nunconditional charging decision is made publicly and with the intent to induce action and\nreliance by the defendant, and when the defendant does so to his detriment (and in some\ninstances upon the advice of counsel), denying the defendant the benefit of that decision\nis an affront to fundamental fairness, particularly when it results in a criminal prosecution\nthat was foregone for more than a decade. No mere changing of the guard strips that\ncircumstance of its inequity. See, e.g., State v. Myers, 5l3 S.E.2d 676, 682 n.l (W.Va.\nl998) (explaining that “any change in the duly elected prosecutor does not affect the\nstandard of responsibility for the office”). A contrary result would be patently untenable.\nIt would violate long-cherished principles of fundamental fairness. It would be antithetical\nto, and corrosive of, the integrity and functionality of the criminal justice system that we\nstrive to maintain.\n\nFor these reasons, Cosby’s convictions and judgment of sentence are vacated,\nand he is discharged.*°\n\nJustices Todd, Donohue and Mundy join the opinion.\n\nJustice Dougherty files a concurring and dissenting opinion in which\nChief Justice Baer joins.\n\nJustice Saylor files a dissenting opinion.\na5 Accordingly, we do not address Cosby’s other issue.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 79\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4892\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004959.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3l4 Filed o7/l2/2l Page5of7\nPage 5\notherwise making wholly inappropriate comments to the press?\n\nFor example, Spencer Kuvin (who represents some of Maxwell’s accusers) was\ninterviewed for a recent shou on Peacock called Epstein’s Shadou: Ghislaine Maxwell,\nwhich aired June 24, 2o2l.

It is important to note that in this article, examples of grooming\nwith different genders of perpetrator and genders of victim are not readily\ndistinguished. This is primarily due to the fact that the grooming literature\nreviewed did not always provide statistics about which grooming behaviors\nwere used on boys versus girls. In addition, most of the grooming literature\nreviewed discussed male offenders.\nIdentifying Potential Victims\nElliot and colleagues (l995) interviewed 9l child sex offenders about the\nstrategies they used when commiting their offenses. They found that 33%\nof the offenders explicitly worked on becoming welcome in the child’s\nhome and l8% offered incentives or threatened their victims to recruit other\nchildren and then gave bribes to the recruits.\n\nConte, Wolf, and Smith (l989) interviewed 26 offenders about their\ncrimes. They found that offenders often admited to being able to iden-\ntify what they considered a vulnerable child—often one who was “needy”\nand seemed “quiet.” For example, one offender stated that his tactic was to\n“look for a kid who is easy to manipulate. They will go along with anything\nyou say. I would approach them by being friendly, leting them think I was\nsomeone they could confide in and talk to” (Conte et al., l989, p. 298).\n\nIn her review of literature about sexual abuse involving teachers,\nShakeshaft (2oo4) noted that selection of a victim is “influenced by the\ncompliance of the student and the likelihood of secrecy” (p. 32). Teachers\nusually look to victimize students whom they have control over. Shakeshaft\nalso identified factors that make a child vulnerable to educator sexual abuse,\nsuch as problems at home with parents, lack of confidence, and _partici-\npation in other risky behavior. Houever, it also must be remembered that\nnonoffending adults could see the same needs in these vulnerable children\nand want to help them in legitimate ways. Thus the child’s vulnerability and\nneeds cannot be a sufficient <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> for defining grooming.\n\nThe Use of Atention, Bribery, and Coercion\n\nElliot and colleagues (l995) found that 53% of the offenders in their sample\noffered to play games, teach a sport, or teach hou to play a musical instru-\nment. Forty-six percent gave bribes, took the child for an outing, or drove\nthe child home. Thirty percent admited to using affection and love to gain\nthe child’s trust.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nI write to once again ask the Court to release Ghislaine Maxwell prior to trial on the\nconditions set forth in her previous bail applications. My weekly in-person legal visits with Ms.\nMaxwell are conducted under the most humiliating circumstances that I have ever experienced in\nmany decades of federal criminal practice. As disturbing and invasive as they are for no\njustifiable reason, I get to leave; Ms. Maxwell does not. The surveillance rivals scenes of Dr.\nHannibal Lecter’s incarceration as portrayed in the movie, “Silence of the Lambs,” despite the\nabsence of the cage and plastic face guard. Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of detention for the past\nl6 months continue to be reprehensible and uterly inappropriate for woman on the cusp of\nturning 6o with no criminal record or history of violence. It is unwarranted, unrelenting, and\nuterly inappropriate.\n\nMs. Maxwell has been subject to physical and emotional abuse by the correction officers,\npoor and unsanitary living conditions, insufficient nutrition, difficulties reviewing the millions of\nlegal discovery documents in the case against her, and sleep deprivation. She has been\nconsistently housed in segregation from all other inmates, with rotating teams of multiple\ncorrections officers per daily shift which rotate on a bi-weekly basis. Many of the officers are\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6o56\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006059.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4o8 Filed ll/o3/2l Page4of7\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\nthe effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive functioning, “sleep deprivation result[s] in a loss of\ncognitive flexibility through feedback...sleep deprivation causes a fundamental problem with\ndynamic atentional control.” 4\n\nMs. Maxwell’s ability to cope with the stress of her legal proceedings and to participate\nmeaningfully in her defense have been gradually eroded over time due to the conditions of her\nconfinement and are further exacerbated by ongoing sleep deprivation. The conditions of her\nconfinement are seriously impacting her overall mental and physical health which will continue\nto worsen over time if she remains incarcerated under the current conditions and subject to the\nregiment on trial — sleep deprivation, inadequate nutrition, exposure to cold temperature, daily\nhumiliation. If she were released, her ongoing symptoms which will be exacerbated during trial\nwould likely resolve completely, and she would be afforded the opportunity to properly prepare\nher defense for trial and endure the rigor of each trial day.\n\nMs. Maxwell is not a flight risk. The government concedes she poses no risk to the\ncommunity. She is a mature adult with no prior history of criminal or violent behavior. She has\nsteadfastly proclaimed her innocence, has maintained a strong desire to fight the case against her\nand is determined to fight her charges at trial and clear her name. There is no indication that she\nwould atempt to flee given her personality profile and determination to be exonerated.\n\nThe bi-weekly teams of guards rotated in from high-security BOP facilities have reported\nto Ms. Maxwell that they are informed that she is a security and suicide risk, which heightens\ntheir vigilance and contempt. Like the assertion that she is a flight risk, alleging she is a suicide\nrisk is a total fiction. Recently, a senior staff person at the MDC stated, in substance: “The\nproblem we have with Ms. Maxwell is simple: she’s not a criminal.”\n\n*Honn, K. A., Hinson, J. M., Whitney, P., & Van Dongen, H.

For the entire day she was provided inadequate food and liquid, was not permited\nto retain and review her legal materials and was kept shackled on a metal bench in an excessively\ncold cell. This past Monday, she was awakened at 3:45 a.m. and given a broun bag with two\nsmall apples, two small containers of milk and a cup of cereal but no utensils. She was not\npermited to bring a sweatshirt for warmth. She was transported to the courthouse by two\nmarshals.

Should\nshe be subjected to these conditions throughout the trial, it is highly likely that she will not have\nthe stamina to assist in her defense and endure the physical demands of a five-day per week,\nmulti-week court proceedings under the current onerous conditions of her detention.\n\nThe Court and the defense are nou in possession of Jencks Act and Giglio material\nregarding the four accusers which contradict the purported “strength” of the government’s case.\nContrary to the government’s claim — which the Court relied on to repeatedly deny Ms.\nMaxwell’s robust bail applications — there is no independent corroboration for the accusers’\nrespective allegations of abuse. Their respective statements do not corroborate one another and\nfurther demonstrate contamination and collusion from various sources.

After returning Ms. Maxwell to the 4\" floor cell block at 5oo Pearl follouing the court\nappearance at 4o Foley Square, a round trip that required Ms. Maxwell to navigate stairs while in leg\nshackles, the marshal was verbally threatening. His brusque manner was evident in the courtroom. When\nalone with Ms. Maxwell, he stated, in substance: “You think you are special. You are not special.\nRemember you are in custody and the judge doesn’t care about you”’ Ms. Maxwell was placed in a\nholding cell where she remained, unaware whether she would be brought to the U.S. Atorney’s Office on\nthe 5™ Floor of 5oo Pearl Street for a scheduled evidence review of which the marshal was aware. Ms.\nMaxwell does not need to be reminded that she is in custody and that she is being treated worse than most\nother pretrial detainees. It is especially concerning when a pretrial detainee is treated more abusively in\ncourt than in the MDC. The marshal’s vitriol runs counter to the presumption of innocence and reflects\npoorly on the district’s Marshal Service.

In one of the first studies on the implantation of false memories, participants were\ngiven short narratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives, and asked\nto try to remember these experiences. Research by Elizabeth Loftus has revealed hou subtle\ninformation introduced after an event may alter the memory of that event. Loftus and her\nstudents have conducted more than 2oo studies with more than 2o,ooo participants\ndemonstrating hou misinformation introduced after an event can induce people into creating\nfalse memories.\n\nIntoxication: Intoxication can substantially increase the likelihood of a false allegation of\nsexual assault. Alcohol and other intoxicants pose a significant problem in sorting out the\nvalidity of a sexual assault allegation. The information-processing errors induced by intoxicating\nsubstances may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while a person was\nintoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he or she was\nunder the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may\natempt to make sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events that\noccurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize what memories are intact,\na person may confabulate or fill in the memory lapses with events that seem probable or which\nfor some reason they come to believe “must have” taken place.\n\nAntisocial Personality Disorder: The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is\na pervasive patern of behavior that disregards and violates of the rights of others. It often begins\nin early childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. If an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder is likely to lie to achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of\nsexual assault might be the means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\naccused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act and a lack of\nremorse could allou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false allegation of\nsexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial personality disorder makes a false\nclaim of assault.\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious\nmental <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> characterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in\ninterpersonal relationships, and difficulties with self-image. Of particular note is the rapid\nswitching from idealization to devaluation, impulsivity, and manipulative features of borderline\npersonality disorder. The instability of relationships experienced by an individual with BPD may\nbe rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant others or lovers to\ndevaluing them. This sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feeling\nthat the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion of abandonment. The rapid\nshifting between idealizing and demonization may bring about a change in perspective such that\na relationship that was viewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse” and may lead a person\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l88\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006189.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4l8-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page9ofl4\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 9\nwith BPD to believe he or she is a victim of sexual assault. Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship and/or relationship\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic personality disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual assault charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some\ncases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim\nadamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l89\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006190.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4l8-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page loof l4\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage lo\n\nDissociation: Dissociation is ‘the lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feelings,\nand experiences into the stream of consciousness and memory. Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\nIntellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may\nalso complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.\n\nChanges in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in\ndetermining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2ol5) conducted a\nnarrative analysis of l47 sets of allegations of sexual assault across short (3 month) and long (6\nmonth) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing literature, Peace\nand colleagues found that genuine traumatic experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to\ndrastic impairments in recall. Houever, some inconsistencies especially in less core maters are\nto be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their\nsample of l47 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more\ndetail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers\nfound that fabricated allegations of traumatic experiences contained more inconsistent details\nboth at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or\nfalse) does tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers\nfound that the number of details present in genuine reports continued to decrease over time\nwhereas fabricated stories ‘levelled off” in detail.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l9o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006201.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 423 Filed ll/o8/2l Pagelofil\nGas U.S. Department of Justice\nN27 United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

(Dkt. 4o8 (“Def. Mot.’)). This Court has\nrepeatedly found that there are no conditions of release that can reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance (Dkt. 93, lo6, l69), and the Second Circuit has twice rejected the defendant’s appeals\n(see United States v. Maxwell, No. 2l-58, Dkt. 86, 96 (2d Cir.)). The defendant’s latest motion\nlargely repeats arguments that have been made and rejected before. There is no basis for the Court\nto reconsider its prior rulings.\n\nA. Procedural History\n\nl. The Court’s First Detention Order\n\nAfter the defendant’s arrest, this Court received multiple writen submissions and held a\nlengthy oral argument on the question of bail. (See Dkt. 93 (“First Order’”’)). On July l4, 2o2o, in\na detailed oral ruling, the Court ordered the defendant detained on the basis of risk of flight. (/d.\nat 79-9l). First, the Court found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense here weigh in\nfavor of detention,” given the statutory presumption of detention triggered by charges involving\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006202.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 423 Filed ll/o8/2l Page2ofll\nPage 2\n\nminor victims and the potential penalties those charges carry. U/d. at 82). Second, the Court\ndetermined that “[t]he government’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong”\nbased on the “multiple victims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in\nserious crimes,” as well as corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary\nevidence.” (/d.). Third, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics\ndemonstrate that she poses a risk of flight. (/d. at 83). In addressing that third factor, the Court\nemphasized the defendant’s “substantial international ties,” which “could facilitate living abroad,”\nincluding “multiple foreign citizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least\none foreign property of significant value.” (/d.). The Court noted that Maxwell “is a citizen of\nFrance, a nation that does not appear to extradite its citizens,” and found that Maxwell “possesses\nextraordinary financial resources,” yet “the representations made to Pretrial Services regarding the\ndefendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid picture of the resources\navailable.” (Ud. at 83-84).\n\nAccordingly, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of demonstrating\nthat the defendant “‘poses a substantial actual risk of flight” and that “even the most restrictive\nconditions of release would be insufficient” to ensure her appearance. (/d. at 86). The Court found\nthat although Maxwell “apparently failed to submit a full accounting or even a close to full\naccounting of her financial situation,” “[e]ven if the picture of her financial resources were not\nopaque, as it is, detention would still be appropriate.” (/d. at 86-87). That conclusion was informed\nby the defendant’s “significant financial resources” and “demonstrated sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (/d. at 87). The Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent\nconduct underscores her extraordinary capacity to evade detection, even in the face of what the\ndefense has acknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.). The Court\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006203.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 423 Filed ll/o8/2l Page3ofll\nPage 3\nconcluded that electronic monitoring and private security guards “would be insufficient” because\nthe defendant could remove the monitor and evade private guards. (/d. at 87-88).\n\nFinally, the Court rejected the defendant’s arguments about the risks of COVID-l9 and the\ndifficulty of preparing a defense with an incarcerated client, noting that the defendant had many\nmonths to prepare for trial. (/d. at 89-9o). The Court found that measures in place were sufficient\nto ensure the defendant’s access to her counsel, but also directed the Government to work with the\ndefense “to provide adequate communication between counsel and client” and stated that the\ndefense may make specific applications to the Court for further relief if the process was\n“inadequate in any way.” (/d. at 9o-9l).\n\n2. The Court’s Second Detention Order\n\nThe defendant renewed her bail application in December 2o2o, presenting a revised bail\npackage with additional financial restrictions. (Dkt. 97). After receiving further writen\nsubmissions (Dkt. loo, lo3), the Court denied the defendant’s application in a writen opinion\nissued on December 28, 2o2o. (Dkt. lo6 (“Second Order”)). The Court found that the arguments\npresented “either were made at the initial bail hearing or could have been made then” and the new\ninformation “only solidifies the Court’s view that the Defendant plainly poses a risk of flight and\nthat no combination of conditions can ensure her appearance.” (/d. at l-2). The Court explained:\n\nthe charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and\n\ncarry lengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence\n\nproffered by the Government, including multiple corroborating and\n\ncorroborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial\n\nresources and foreign ties (including citizenship in a country that\n\ndoes not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who lived in\n\nhiding and apart from the family to whom she nou asserts important\n\nties, has not been fully candid about her financial situation.\n(/d. at 2). The Court rejected the defendant’s claim that the Government overstated the strength of\nits case at the bail hearing, finding that the defendant “too easily discredits the witness testimony.”\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006204.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 423 Filed ll/o8/2l Page4ofll\nPage 4\n(Id. at 9-lo). The Court credited the Government’s proffer that “additional evidence, including\nflight records and other witnesses’ corroborating testimony, will further support the main\nwitnesses’ testimony and link the Defendant to Epstein’s conduct.” (/d. at lo).\n\nThe Court found that the defendant “continues to have substantial international ties and\nmultiple foreign citizenships, and she continues to have familial and personal connections abroad.”\n(/d. at ll). The Court was unpersuaded by the defendant’s offer to consent to extradition, noting\nthat the “legal weight of the waivers is, at best, contested” and therefore the risk of flight remained\n“fundamentally unchanged.” (/d. at ll-l3). The Court further explained that the defendant’s\n“extraordinary financial resources also continue to provide her the means to flee the country and\nto do so undetected.” (/d. at l3).\n\nThe Court emphasized that the defendant’s “patern of providing incomplete or erroneous\ninformation to the Court or to Pretrial Services bears significantly” on its assessment of her history\nand characteristics. (/d. at l5). In so doing, the Court highlighted that in July 2o2o the defendant\nrepresented to Pretrial Services that she possessed around $3.5 million in assets, but in connection\nwith her renewed request for bail presented a report on her finances that estimated the net worth\nof the defendant and her spouse to be approximately $22.5 million as of October 2o2o. (/d.). The\nCourt found that the difference “makes it unlikely that the misrepresentation was the result of the\nDefendant’s misestimation rather than misdirection.” (/d. at l5-l6). The Court explained:\n\nIn sum, the evidence ofa lack of candor is, if anything, stronger nou\nthan in July 2o2o, as it is clear to the Court that the Defendant’s\nrepresentations to Pretrial Services were woefully incomplete. That\nlack of candor raises significant concerns as to whether the Court\nhas nou been provided a full and accurate picture of her finances\nand as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\nconditions of release.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006205.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 423 Filed ll/o8/2l Page5oflil\nPage 5\n(Id. at l6). The Court again concluded that the defendant presented a risk of flight and that the\nproposed bail package “cannot reasonably assure her appearance,” as it “would leave unrestrained\nmillions of dollars and other assets that she could sell in order to support herself” and the “proposed\nbond is only partially secured.” (/d. at l6-l8).\n\nFinally, the Court was “unpersuaded” by the defendant’s argument “that the conditions of\nher confinement are uniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and\nthus justify release.” (/d. at 2o). The Court noted that the defendant did not “meaningfully dispute”\nthat she has received more time than other inmates at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”)\nto review discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her lawyers. (/d.). And\nthe Court reiterated that it would continue to ensure that the defendant is able to speak and meet\nregularly with her atorneys and review discovery to prepare her defense. (/d. at 2o n.3).\n\n3. The Court’s Third Detention Order\n\nOn February 23, 2o2l, the defendant filed a third bail application, proposing two additional\nbail conditions: (l) renunciation of her French and British citizenship; and (2) placement of a\nportion of her and her spouse’s assets in a new account to be overseen by a monitor. (Dkt. l6o).\nAfter considering multiple writen submissions (Dkt. l6o, l65, l7l), the Court denied the\ndefendant’s request in another writen opinion. (Dkt. l69 (“Third Order’’)).\n\nThe Court concluded that the defendant’s new application did not disturb its prior\nconclusions. (/d. at 2). The Court reiterated that detention was warranted in light of the proffered\nstrength and nature of the Government’s case, the defendant’s “substantial international ties,\nfamilial and personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\ndetection,” and the defendant’s “lack of candor regarding her assets” at the time of her arrest.

(/d. at 5-6). The\nCourt also rejected the two additional conditions proposed by the defendant, noting the\n“Tclonsiderable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the [foreign\ncitizenship] renunciations,” and finding that, despite the proposed monitorship, the defendant\n“would continue to have access to substantial assets—certainly enough to enable her flight and to\nevade prosecution.” (/d. at lo-ll). The Court concluded, “If the Court could conclude that any set\nof conditions could reasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance, it would order her\nrelease. Yet while her proposed bail package is substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable\nassurances.” (/d. at ll).\n\n4. The Second Circuit’s Orders\n\nThe defendant filed appeals from the Court’s second and third detention orders. After\nhearing oral argument, the Circuit denied the defendant’s motion for bail in a writen order. (See\nUnited States v. Maxwell, No. 2l-58, Dkt. 86 (2d Cir. Apr. 27, 2o2l)).\n\nFollouing that decision, the defendant submited a leter to this Court asking it “to address\nMs. Maxwell’s sleeping conditions by directing MDC to cease l5-minute light surveillance of Ms.\nMaxwell or justify the need for the disruptive flashlight surveillance.” (Dkt. 256 at 2). The Court\npromptly ordered the Government to confer with MDC counsel and provide the Court with an\nexplanation regarding the use of flashlights and the basis for it, which the Government then did.\n(Dkt. 257, 27o). On May l4, 2o2l, this Court issued an order denying the defendant’s request for\nan order directing the MDC to modify its nightime monitoring schedule. (Dkt. 282). In reaching\nthis decision, the Court noted that the defendant’s claim that MDC staff were shining the light\ndirectly into her eyes and disrupting her sleep was “unsupported by affidavit or other factual\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006207.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 423 Filed ll/o8/2l Page7ofll\nPage 7\nshouing.” (/d. at l). The Court also found that “nothing in the record plausibly establishes that\ncurrent protocols interfere with Maxwell’s ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with\nher lawyers.” (/d. at 2).\n\nThe defendant then filed another motion in the Second Circuit, seeking bail or, in the\nalternative, an evidentiary hearing regarding the conditions of her confinement. (See United States\nv. Maxwell, No. 2l-58, Dkt. 89 (2d Cir. May l7, 2o2l)). In the motion, she renewed her claims\nthat the “horrific conditions [at MDC] make it impossible to prepare for trial.” (/d. at 2; see also\nid. at 2-3 (listing alleged horrific conditions, such as sleep deprivation, broun water, surveillance\nof atorney-client meetings, overflouing sewage, computer without sufficient capacity to review\ndiscovery)). The Second Circuit denied her motion in a writen order. (See United States v.\nMaxwell, No. 2l-58, Dkt. 96 (2d Cir. June 2, 2o2l)).\n\nB. Applicable Law\n\nIn seeking pretrial detention, the Government bears the burden of shouing, by a\npreponderance of the evidence, that the defendant poses a risk of flight, and that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or\ncombination of conditions would reasonably assure her presence in court. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f);\nUnited States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7).\n\nHouever, where, as here, the defendant is charged with certain offenses, including offenses\ninvolving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. §§ l59l, 2422 or 2423, a statutory presumption arises\n“that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the\nperson as required... .” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). In such a case, the defendant “bears a limited\nburden of production—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward\nwith evidence that [s]he does not pose a ... risk of flight.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d\n433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool). Even where a defendant produces sufficient evidence to rebut the statutory\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006208.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 423 Filed ll/o8/2l Page8oflil\nPage 8\n\npresumption of detention, the presumption does not disappear; instead, it becomes a factor to be\nweighed and considered in deciding whether release is warranted. /d.\n\nWhere the Government seeks detention based on flight risk, the court must consider: (l)\n“the nature and circumstances of the offense charged”; (2) “the weight of the evidence against the\nperson”; and (3) the “history and characteristics of the person.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nA detention hearing may be reopened “at any time before trial if the judicial officer finds\nthat information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a\nmaterial bearing on the issue whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure\nthe appearance of such person as required.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f); see also United States v.

Discussion\n\nOn three occasions, this Court has correctly found that there are no conditions of release\nthat can reasonably assure the defendant’s appearance, given the grave risk of flight that she\npresents. In three carefully reasoned decisions issued after lengthy briefing and argument, this\nCourt has concluded that detention is appropriate in light of the nature and circumstances of the\noffense, which carry a presumption of detention; the strength of the Government’s proffered\nevidence; and the defendant’s history and characteristics, particularly her substantial international\nties, multiple foreign citizenships, familial and personal connections abroad, ounership of at least\none foreign property of significant value, lack of candor about her finances, and “extraordinary\ncapacity to evade detection.” (First Order at 79-9l; Second Order at 7-2o; Third Order at 6-ll).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006209.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 423 Filed ll/o8/2l Page9ofll\nPage 9\n\nThe defendant’s latest bail application does not meaningfully engage with the Court’s\nprevious findings and reasoning. Nor does it identify any intervening change in law or factual\ncircumstance. Instead, the defense turns to rhetoric and anecdotes beter suited to tabloids than\nbriefs. Where legal arguments can be found, they are cursory and unpersuasive.\n\nWith respect to risk of flight, the defendant’s argument consists of a single paragraph, in\nwhich she asserts that she “is not a flight risk” because she “is a mature adult” who has “proclaimed\nher innocence” and therefore “[t]here is no indication that she would atempt to flee given her\npersonality profile and determination to be exonerated.” (Def. Mot. 4). These conclusory\nassertions were also made in her prior bail applications, which have been rejected. (See, e.g., Dkt.\nl8 at l, 3; Dkt. 97 at l; Dkt. l6o at 2). And they completely fail to address the Court’s detailed\nfindings about the defendant’s substantial international ties, multiple foreign citizenships, familial\nand personal connections abroad, ounership of at least one foreign property of significant value,\nlack of candor about her finances, and extraordinary capacity to evade detection.\n\nThe defendant’s primary argument consists of allegations and complaints about the\nconditions of her confinement, which are loosely tied to the claim that such conditions impair her\nability to prepare for trial. But these same complaints have been a part of each of the defendant’s\nbail applications (see, e.g., Dkt. l8 at 7-9; Dkt. 97 at 35-38; Dkt. l7l at 9-lo), as well as numerous\nother submissions to the Court. Throughout this case, the Court has maintained close oversight of\nthose conditions,' and ensured that the defendant has ample time to review her discovery and\nprepare for trial—more time, in fact, than any other inmate at the MDC. (Second Order at 2o). And\nthe Court has repeatedly found that the defendant’s ability to prepare for trial has not been\n' For example, in response to the defendant’s most recent complaint—regarding the timing of her\ntransportation to Court—the Court directed the Government to confer with the BOP and United\nStates Marshals Service, and the Government is providing a leter addressing the issue today.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006219.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page8of4l\nHe also lists these “pathways,” in terms at times “drawn nearly verbatim” from a 2ol2 article ina\nforensic psychology journal, along with conjectures of ways in which these mental conditions or\ncircumstances could hypothetically lead to false claims of sexual assault, including the follouing\nexamples:\n\ne “Lying”: “Often, humans lie because of what they perceive as the favorable\nconsequences for lying; for sexual assault these consequences could be . . . the severe\nnegative consequences that the alleged perpetrator experiences . .. secondary gain from\nvictim status ... excusing behaviors or characteristics of the alleged victim (e.g., sexual\nactivity, pregnancy, sexually transmited diseases) [or] financial gain.” (Ex.

This “opinion” should be precluded.\n\n4. Opinions as to “Pathways to False Allegations of Sexual Assault”\n\nThe defense’s offer of Dr. Dietz’s opinions regarding the existence of false allegations of\nsexual assault and the “multiple pathways to these false allegations of sexual assault” (Ex. A at 7)\nis a remarkable departure from permissible practice in a criminal trial. The very form and nature\nof all of these opinions is highly prejudicial and seeks to invade the province of the jury and\ndisplace the Court; the offer of these opinions, which are largely lifted “nearly verbatim” from a\nsingle journal article (atached as Exhibit C), is not the product of reliable methods applied to the\ncase; the opinions are well within the ken of the jury; and there is no shouing whatsoever of any\n“fit” between these opinions and the evidence to be presented at trial.\n\nThe form of Dr. Dietz’s opinions—listing a number of disparate circumstances and\npersonality traits, with no shouing of any connection to the evidence of this case, and conjecturing\nvarious ways in which they could lead to false allegations of sexual assault—is a breathtaking\ninversion of proper expert opinion. To appreciate the audacity of the defense approach, consider\nif the Government atempted to do something similar. If the defense put on witnesses at trial, and\nthe Government then called in rebutal an expert psychiatrist to offer opinions on “Pathways to\nFalse Exculpatory Testimony” who opined that a variety of circumstances or mental conditions\ncould hypothetically lead individuals to testify in ways that falsely exculpated a defendant, it is\nsafe to assume that the defense would object. What the defense offers here is no less inappropriate.\n\nBeyond the obvious problems with the form of the opinions, the opinions themselves are\nplainly not admissible under Rule 7o2. Dr. Dietz’s opinion that “[flalse allegations of sexual\nassault do occur” (Ex. A at 7), is not helpful to the jury. There will be no dispute that allegations\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6233\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006235.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 24 of 4l\n9l, lol (2d Cir. 2ool) (“[T]he district court should not admit testimony that is directed solely to\nlay maters which a jury is capable of understanding and deciding without the expert’s help.”\n(internal quotation marks omited)).\n\nEven as to the opinions that involve psychological conditions, Dr. Dietz’s opinions are not\nhelpful to the jury. While Dr. Dietz’s descriptions of antisocial personality disorder, borderline\npersonality disorder, histrionic personality disorder, psychotic disorders, delirium, dissociation,\nand intellectual disability at least involve Dr. Dietz’s psychiatric training in some way (unlike\npathways such as “lying”), it is hardly beyond the ken of juries to knou that mental disorders or\naltered mental states may at times motivate people to dissemble or to believe things that are not\ntrue. Atempting to put the imprimatur of an expert on a variety of ways in which mental disorders\ncan lead to unreliable testimony is simply an atempt to invade the province of the jury by puting\na thumb on the scale in their assessment of witness credibility.’ See, e.g., Nimely, 4l4 F.3d at 398\n(“[E]xpert opinions that constitute evaluations of witness credibility, even when such evaluations\nare rooted in scientific or technical expertise, are inadmissible under Rule 7o2”); United States v.\nLumpkin, l92 F.3d 28o, 289 (2d Cir. l999) (barring expert from testifying as to scientific principle\nrelated to the assessment of witness credibility as impinging on jury’s role).\n\nTo the extent Dr. Dietz’s opinions include something outside the ken of the average jury—\nspecifically, that these “pathways” purportedly occur frequently in sexual assault cases—they are\n7Dr. Dietz should in any event not offer his opinions on false memory, which are apparently\nderivative of Dr. Loftus’s. Given that the defense has noticed Dr. Loftus as a witness, if any false\nmemory testimony is appropriate, it should come from Dr. Loftus, whose research it is based on,\nnot from Dr. Dietz summarizing Dr. Loftus’s research. The admissibility of Dr. Loftus’s testimony\non false memory is discussed in Section II, infra.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6235\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006236.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 25 of 4l\n\nnot reliable. The article that Dr. Dietz relies on—in fact “nearly verbatim” (Ex. A at 7)—was\nintended as a research agenda to explain the (undoubted) instances of false accusations, not to\nprovide a roadmap for establishing the falsity of any allegation. (See Ex. C at 98 (“Part of the\nfocus of the present paper, then, is to bring atention to the dearth of psychological literature\ninvestigating correlates and causal mechanisms of false allegations of sexual assault and to propose\na model specifying the major causal pathways to false allegations. These pathways are intended\nas a model for further empirical investigation.” (emphasis added))). Indeed, the authors were\nemphatic that their article not be misused as a simplistic means of “determining the accuracy of\nspecific accusations.” (Ex. C at 98 (“[A] legitimate concern about enumerating such pathways is\nthe misuse of psychological diagnoses in determining the accuracy of specific accusations.”)).\n\nFinally, even to the extent that Dr. Dietz’s opinions on any of these “pathways” offers any\nexpertise that is truly beyond the ken of the jury, there is no justification for allouing him to offer\nthese opinions in the abstract without any fit to the facts of the case. At a minimum, unless and\nuntil there is any evidence creating a predicate for the relevance of any of these mental disorders,\nit is simply irrelevant—and highly prejudicial—for a psychiatric expert to enumerate a number of\nmental disorders and conjecture that they could cause unreliable testimony. See, e.g., LVL XII\nBrands, Inc., 2o9 F. Supp. 3d at 642 (finding testimony fails Daubert’s “fit” requirement where\nthere is a lack of “record foundation”).* Thus even if, contrary to the arguments above, the Court\nbelieved some of the opinions on these “pathways” could under some circumstances be helpful to\nthe jury, the Court should defer on the admissibility of such opinions until the evidence at trial\n8 Of course, to the extent a witness’s mental <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> is relevant, it should not be simply the\nsubject of lay diagnosis by the jury, as Dr. Dietz’s notice seems to suggest.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6236\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006237.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 26 of 4l\ncreates a predicate that a witness has a <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> creating such a “pathway.” And even then, as\ndescribed above, it is likely that such an opinion, based on one article, would be unreliable, only\nmarginally helpful to a jury that can understand the relationship between mental illness and truth-\ntelling, and highly prejudicial by having an expert witness testify to the credibility of other\nwitnesses. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3..\n\n5. Opinions Regarding the Credibility of Witnesses\n\nDr. Dietz also offers several different opinions regarding the assessment of the credibility\nof witnesses. These are also not helpful to the jury.\n\nDr. Dietz’s opinion that emotional distress is not predictive of the truthfulness of an\nallegation invades the core of a jury’s competency—the evaluation of a witness’s demeanor.\nIndeed, in very similar circumstances, the Second Circuit has affirmed the exclusion of scientific\nexpert testimony instructing the jury in hou to assess a witness’s demeanor. See Lumpkin, l92\nF.3d at 289 (barring expert from testifying that “confidence bears litle or no relationship to\naccuracy in identifications,” reasoning that “Fundamental to the role of juror as trier of fact is the\ntask of assessing witness credibility. And, a witness’s demeanor on the stand, including his or her\nconfidence, impacts the assessment of credibility.”). The same result should apply here.\n\nSimilarly, Dr. Dietz’s opinion that “professionals” evaluate “[c]hanges in the core details\nof the allegations” to determine credibility (Ex. A at lo), also invades the province of the jury.\nHou to reconcile inconsistencies in witness accounts, as part of assessing the credibility of\nwitnesses, is at the core of the jury’s function. See, eg., Lumpkin, l92 F.3d at 289. The\nGovernment expects that the Court will instruct the jury on hou to assess the credibility of\nwitnesses, and having one party’s witness lay doun a set of expert-endorsed rules can only make\nit more difficult for the jurors to follou the Court’s instructions. See, e.g., Hygh, 96l F.2d at 364.\n\nae\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6237\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006261.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page9ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 8\ncan arise when it was reasonable to believe consent was given but the alleged victim falsely\nbelieves that it was not.\n\nFalse Memory: The existence and prevalence of repressed memories is a source of\ncontroversy, and yet research does exist demonstrating the successful implantation of fabricated\nmemories. In one of the first studies on the implantation of false memories, participants were\ngiven short narratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives, and asked\nto try to remember these experiences. Research by Elizabeth Loftus has revealed hou subtle\ninformation introduced after an event may alter the memory of that event. Loftus and her\nstudents have conducted more than 2oo studies with more than 2o,ooo participants\ndemonstrating hou misinformation introduced after an event can induce people into creating\nfalse memories.\n\nIntoxication: Intoxication can substantially increase the likelihood of a false allegation of\nsexual assault. Alcohol and other intoxicants pose a significant problem in sorting out the\nvalidity of a sexual assault allegation. The information-processing errors induced by intoxicating\nsubstances may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while a person was\nintoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he or she was\nunder the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may\natempt to make sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events that\noccurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize what memories are intact,\na person may confabulate or fill in the memory lapses with events that seem probable or which\nfor some reason they come to believe “must have” taken place.\n\nAntisocial Personality Disorder: The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is\na pervasive patern of behavior that disregards and violates of the rights of others. It often begins\nin early childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. If an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder is likely to lie to achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of\nsexual assault might be the means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\naccused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act and a lack of\nremorse could allou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false allegation of\nsexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial personality disorder makes a false\nclaim of assault.\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious\nmental <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> characterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in\ninterpersonal relationships, and difficulties with self-image. Of particular note is the rapid\nswitching from idealization to devaluation, impulsivity, and manipulative features of borderline\npersonality disorder. The instability of relationships experienced by an individual with BPD may\nbe rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant others or lovers to\ndevaluing them. This sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feeling\nthat the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion of abandonment. The rapid\nshifting between idealizing and demonization may bring about a change in perspective such that\na relationship that was viewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse” and may lead a person\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo626l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006262.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page loofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 9\nwith BPD to believe he or she is a victim of sexual assault. Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship and/or relationship\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic personality disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual assault charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some\ncases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim\nadamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6262\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006263.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Pagellofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage lo\n\nDissociation: Dissociation is ‘the lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feelings,\nand experiences into the stream of consciousness and memory. Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\nIntellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may\nalso complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.\n\nChanges in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in\ndetermining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2ol5) conducted a\nnarrative analysis of l47 sets of allegations of sexual assault across short (3 month) and long (6\nmonth) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing literature, Peace\nand colleagues found that genuine traumatic experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to\ndrastic impairments in recall. Houever, some inconsistencies especially in less core maters are\nto be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their\nsample of l47 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more\ndetail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers\nfound that fabricated allegations of traumatic experiences contained more inconsistent details\nboth at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or\nfalse) does tend to decrease over time.

There is no psychologi-\ncal diagnosis that alone could preclude the possibility that a sexual assault\noccurred. Rather, these generate rival plausible hypotheses that need to be\nevaluated to thoroughly evaluate all the possible candidates for explaining\nthe allegation. That is, an investigation into a contested sexual assault charge\nis more complete and accurate when two overarching hypotheses are con-\nsidered: (a) This individual with psychological <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> x was indeed\nsexually assaulted or (b) this individual with psychological <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> x is\nmaking a false allegation due to <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> x (xk can be equal to o). This is\nmore complete than considering only one of these possibilities. Of course,\nwhen no relevant psychological <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> is present, the second need not be\nconsidered. In addition, where there is overwhelming evidence (witnesses)\nthat make <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> (b) obviously false, then again, this <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> need not\nbe evaluated. Other methodologies such as lie detection (Gruben & Madsen,\n2oo5) may be used to make assessments, but a review of these methods is\nbeyond the scope of this paper.\n\nA person falsely convicted (or even accused) of an alleged crime will\nexperience significant psychological, financial, and social consequences.\nPrevention of both false convictions and false acquitals should be the\nutmost priority in any sexual assault case. Considering the dearth of forensic\nresearch on causal mechanisms of false allegations by claimants, it appears\nthat this work is needed to offset the bulk of forensic practice that is not\nguided by a model to understand hou false allegations may be generated.\nWe make no claim regarding the moral equivalency of a true allegation\nthat is not believed versus a false allegation that is believed. Rather, we do\nsuggest that minimizing both of these kinds of errors is a worthy goal.\n\nLEGAL AND CULTURAL HISTORY OF SEXUAL ASSAULT\nIN THE UNITED STATES\n\nIt is no surprise that merely raising the issue of false allegations may evoke\ntension and unease in some; for some, this question is not politically cor-\nrect. To be sure, historically claims of sexual assault were handled relatively\nunfairly for the victims both legally and socially. In early America, many\npeople looked upon rape perpetration as litle more than a sexual misdeed\non the level of premarital sex and as an unfortunate consequence of sexual\ndesire (Block, 2oo6). Women’s claims of sexual assault were often unfairly\ndoubted. In fact, pswedologia phantastica was the legally and scientifically\nacknouledged term used to describe a delusional state in which a woman\nfalsely believed that she had been raped (Bessmer, l984).\n\nBeginning in the l96os, a public counteraction to the prevailing treat-\nment of rape victims gained prominence, largely spurred by the feminist\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6273\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006283.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l5 of 29\n\nPathways to False Allegations lo9\n\nto achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of sexual assault might be\n\nthe means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\n\naccused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggres-\n\nsive act fiting diagnostic criterion 4. Furthermore, a lack of remorse could\n\nallou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\n\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false\n\nallegation of sexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial\n\npersonality disorder makes a false claim of assault.\n\nAntisocial personality disorder occurs more in men than women\n(Lamont & Brunero, 2oo9; American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo), with\nprevalence rates of 3% and l%, respectively, based on data from community\nsamples (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo). Though women are the\nmost frequent reporters of being victims of sexual assault, men may also\nreport sexual assault. It is important to note that individuals with antisocial\npersonality disorder are more likely than individuals without antisocial per-\nsonality disorder to report having experienced sexual assault during their\nlifetime and are believed to be at a higher risk for sexual victimization\n(Burnam et al., l988).\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder\n\nBorderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious mental <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> charac-\nterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in interpersonal\nrelationships, and difficulties with self-image Cieb, Zanarini, Schmahl,\nLinehan, & Bohus, 2oo4). Prevalence estimates for BPD from community\nand clinical samples have ranged from .6% to 3.9% of the general popula-\ntion (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo; van Asselt, Dirksen, Arntz, &\nSeveren, 2oo7; as cited in Lenzenweger, Lane, Loranger, & Kessler, 2oo7),\nand the majority diagnosed with BPD—an estimated 75% of people—are\nwomen (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo).\n\nThe DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo) includes nine\ndiagnostic criteria for this disorder, which for simplicity can be narroued\ndoun to four domains (Lieb et al., 2oo4). The first domain is affective distur-\nbance that includes intense emotions, rapidly shifting emotions, and mood\nreactivity. The second domain is disturbed cognition that includes three\nlevels of symptomatology: troubling but non-psychotic problems including\ndissociation (discussed above) and intense feelings of being bad (relevant to\nthis pathway); quasi-psychotic and psychotic-like symptoms of delusions\nand hallucinations (further discussed belou) that are somewhat reality-\nbased; and psychotic symptoms of delusions and hallucinations. The third\ndomain is impulsivity, either physically destructive to the self or general-\nized impulsivity. The fourth domain involves the existence of unstable and\nerratic relationships, in which the borderline individual struggles to avoid\neither real or imagined abandonment.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6283\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006286.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l8 of 29\n\nLl2 J. Engle and W. O’Donobue\n\nindividuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stim-\nulating to a person who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts\n\nof atention received for filing a sexual assault charge and for the “victim”\n\nrole that can be played out in other relationships. In times when atention\n\nis not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\n\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their\ndepressed state.\n\nThe misperception that relationships are more intimate than they actu-\nally are may lead a person with histrionic personality disorder to misconstrue\nnonsexual interactions as events that are sexual in nature. For example, a\nperson who is histrionic may, after a co-worker complements her clothing\nand accidentally bumps into her during the day, construe these actions as\nintentional communications of sexual interest. This misperception can lead\nher to feel that if the individual had touched her chest while bumping into\nher, it was an intentional action of unwanted assault. Thus, a pathway to\nfalse allegations of sexual assault may be through individuals with a diag-\nnosis of histrionic personality disorder who for reasons of atention and\nmisinterpretation may knouingly or unknouingly make a false allegation of\nsexual assault.\n\nDelirium\n\nAccording to the DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo,\np. l36), delirium is a “disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied\nby a change in cognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preex-\nisting or evolving dementia.” Relevant to this pathway are the perceptual\ndisturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations, illusions, or\neven hallucinations.\n\nDelirium may be caused by medical conditions, substance use, or with-\ndrawal or may have multiple etiologies (American Psychiatric Association,\n2ooo). An individual suffering from delirium is out of contact with reality\nand thus may make statements or allegations that are not veridical, includ-\ning false allegations of sexual assault. In these circumstances, an individual\nwith delirium may be under the care and protection of hospital staff, family\nmembers, friends, or even law enforcement. In such situations, caregivers\nmay be in close physical proximity to the patient. The care provided could\nbe construed as sexual, even though the care may have been nonsexual.\nPsychotic Disorders\nThe term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by delu-\nsions and hallucinations (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo). Psychotic\ndisorders include the follouing: schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder,\nschizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, brief psychotic disorder, shared\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6286\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006287.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l9 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations ll3\npsychotic disorder, psychotic disorder due to a general medical <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>,\nsubstance-induced psychotic disorder, and psychotic disorder not otherwise\nspecified. Each of these disorders is knoun to cause gross impairment in\nfunctioning.\n\nThe DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo) details com-\nmon delusions that may be pervasive in individuals with delusional disorder.\nOther psychotic disorders may be associated with these delusional themes as\nwell. Erotomatic delusions involve irrational, unsubstantiated, or impossible\nclaims that some person is in love with the delusional individual. The\nindividual may claim that a movie star or superior at work is secretly\nin love with him or her and that there is a spiritual tie between them.\nAnother delusional theme of interest is the persecutory type. This delu-\nsional theme is characterized by irrational, unsubstantiated, or impossible\nclaims that the individual has been wronged and that some injustice has\ntaken place. Frequent appeals to the court system are common in which the\nindividual atempts to persecute the central person in the delusion. Mixed\ntypes of delusions involve delusions in which no one type predominates.\nA mixed erotomatic and persecutory type might be the type of delusion that\nwould lead to a false allegation of sexual assault. Houever, delusions can\nbe complex and difficult to categorize, even when they are sexual in nature.\n\nStudies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions that\nare sexual in nature are not uncommon and are occur more often in women\nthan in men (Galdos & van Os, l995; Meloy, l989). Some cases of sexual\ndelusions have been documented. In one case, Rosenthal and McGuinness\n(l986), two psychiatric nurses, wrote about a client with delusions cen-\ntered on sex. “When her hydrotherapist offered her a backrub one day,\nshe exclaimed, ‘Don’t touch me! I am not your homosexual lover’’(p. l49).\nThese delusions may lead a person to claim adamantly that sexual relations\nor events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\nDissociation\nDissociation is “the lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feel-\nings, and experiences into the stream of consciousness and memory”\n(Berstein & Putnam, l986). According to the DSM-IV-TR (American\nPsychiatric Association, 2ooo), dissociation involves a disruption or spliting\noff of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient.\nCurrently, there is some controversy concerning the function, antecedents\nand etiology of dissociation (Candel, Merckelbach, & Kuijpers, 2oo3).\n\nDissociative tendencies have been thought to exist as a stable trait\nin some individuals (Waller, Putnam, & Carlson, l996), though most\nresearch has looked only at dissociation in relation to traumatic expe-\nriences. Much of the focus on the relationship between trauma and\ndissociation may be the result of earlier studies that found a relationship\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6287\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006290.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 22 of 29\nll6 J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\nbecause the legal process can be daunting and there may be repercussions\nfrom filing the allegation.\n\nStudies have indicated that sexual assaults among populations with ID\nare most likely to be perpetrated by peer service users (Broun, Stein, &\nTurk, l995). Abuse by family members and care providers is also com-\nmon, whereas perpetration by strangers is the least common. In cases where\npeer service users are the alleged perpetrators, issues of consent are often\nthe focus of the investigation. Establishing the capacity to consent can be\nchallenging in this population as it may be unclear whether individuals have\nsufficient knouledge and understanding to provide fully informed consent\n(Jjoyce, 2oo3). For instance, in some sexual assault cases, individuals with\nID do not have the ability to name the body parts that were involved in the\nassault. Clear protocols for determining informed consent in this population\nwould be useful, as adults with ID have specific challenges that increase\ntheir potential for coercion and. exploitation.\n\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without\nID, have vulnerabilities related to memory and communication that the\nlegal system may not be equipped to handle adequately. Individuals with\nmoderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty communicating\nabout the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions).\nAhgrim-Delzell and Dudley’s (2ool) findings indicate that communications\nskills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims with mild\nID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to\nfile sexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties\nwith memory may also complicate the investigation process for individuals\nwith ID (Gudjonsson & Henry, 2oo3) who have been shoun to have poorer\nmemory than control groups and are more likely than control participants to\nfill in memory gaps with confabulated material (Clare & Gudjonsson, l993).\nHouever, memories of individuals with ID are not necessarily unreliable;\nrather, when information is gathered in a non-leading way, they are likely\nto provide accurate, although usually more limited, information about the\nevent (Ternes & Yuille, 2oo8). In other words, individuals with ID are less\nlikely to remember the details of the event (Kebbel & Haton, l999).\n\nSpecific vulnerabilities in individuals with ID, in addition to poorer\nmemory, may account for inaccurate reporting of events (Gudjonsson &\nJoyce, 2oll). Individuals with ID have been shoun to be significantly more\nsuggestible to leading questions (Gudjonsson & Henry, 2oo3; Everington &\nFulero, l999) and significantly more likely to acquiesce (Clare & Gudjonsson,\nl993) compared to individuals without ID, although there is variability\namong individuals with ID on these traits. Suggestibility refers to a tendency\ntouard accepting information communicated by others and incorporating\nthis information into beliefs and memories. Acquiescence refers to the pre-\ndisposition to passively accept or actively agree with information that is\npresented (Chronbach, l946).

The indictment against her federalizes a New York State B\nmisdemeanor which carries a maximum penalty of 9o days. Ms. Maxwell, who awaits trial, has\nserved that five times over. Ms. Maxwell is not, and has never been, a flight risk. At every\nopportunity, Ms. Maxwell has vigorously asserted her innocence and her eagerness to face these\nunsubstantiated charges in court. She should be alloued to do so outside of the confines of the\nMDC, where her conditions of confinement significantly impede her ability to prepare for trial,\nnegatively impact her health, and compromise her stamina to endure the rigors of trial.\n\nThe Court nou has the 35oo material and Giglio material which seriously undermine the\nstrength of the government’s case and underscore the lack of corroboration, facts which the\ngovernment cannot and does not even atempt to refute. Rather, the government urges the Court\nto rely on prior rulings that were based on government conjecture that is not substantiated by\nrecent disclosures.

The Court agrees\nwith Judge Engelmayer’s response to this argument:\n\nThe absence of large quantity statistical studies is explained by a practical reason\n\nthat should be obvious to all.

In those studies, laboratory conditions literally can be\n\nachieved. ...\n\nThat strictly quantitative mode of inquiry is not realistic or even ethical in the\n\ncontext of studying sex trafficking. The causes and contributors to sex trafficking\n\nby their nature must be studied retrospectively. They cannot ethically be studied\n\notherwise. Subjects cannot be tested to see under what circumstances they would\n\nand would not, on a going forward basis, fall prey to the predations of sex\n\ntraffickers. Given the necessarily retrospective nature of such a study, given the\n\nsmall size of the populations under review, and given the inherently\n\nindividualized circumstances presented by different perpetrators, victims, and\n\ncontexts in this tumultuous and emotionally fraught area of criminal conduct, the\n\nvocabulary of error rates and statistical significance is an unusually poor fit.\n\nTr. at 29-3o, United States v.

Given the realities of studying\nsensitive criminal acts like sexual abuse, a researcher can only rarely verify reports with absolute\ncertainty. Yet that does not mean a clinical or forensic psychologist accepts all statements at\nface value. Rather, as the Government notes, part of Dr. Rocchio’s profession is to examine and\ndiagnose her patients consistent with her significant training and specialized knouledge.\nFurther, on the forensic side of her practice, Dr. Rocchio regularly investigates and verifies\nsexual abuse.

Bennet and W. O’Donobue\non the victims and ask them what techniques their abusers used prior to\nthe abuse. It is important to note that in this article, examples of grooming\nwith different genders of perpetrator and genders of victim are not readily\ndistinguished. This is primarily due to the fact that the grooming literature\nreviewed did not always provide statistics about which grooming behaviors\nwere used on boys versus girls. In addition, most of the grooming literature\nreviewed discussed male offenders.\nIdentifying Potential Victims\nElliot and colleagues (l995) interviewed 9l child sex offenders about the\nstrategies they used when commiting their offenses. They found that 33%\nof the offenders explicitly worked on becoming welcome in the child’s\nhome and l8% offered incentives or threatened their victims to recruit other\nchildren and then gave bribes to the recruits.\n\nConte, Wolf, and Smith (l989) interviewed 26 offenders about their\ncrimes. They found that offenders often admited to being able to iden-\ntify what they considered a vulnerable child—often one who was “needy”\nand seemed “quiet.” For example, one offender stated that his tactic was to\n“look for a kid who is easy to manipulate. They will go along with anything\nyou say. I would approach them by being friendly, leting them think I was\nsomeone they could confide in and talk to” (Conte et al., l989, p. 298).\n\nIn her review of literature about sexual abuse involving teachers,\nShakeshaft (2oo4) noted that selection of a victim is “influenced by the\ncompliance of the student and the likelihood of secrecy” (p. 32). Teachers\nusually look to victimize students whom they have control over. Shakeshaft\nalso identified factors that make a child vulnerable to educator sexual abuse,\nsuch as problems at home with parents, lack of confidence, and _partici-\npation in other risky behavior. Houever, it also must be remembered that\nnonoffending adults could see the same needs in these vulnerable children\nand want to help them in legitimate ways. Thus the child’s vulnerability and\nneeds cannot be a sufficient <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> for defining grooming.\n\nThe Use of Atention, Bribery, and Coercion\n\nElliot and colleagues (l995) found that 53% of the offenders in their sample\noffered to play games, teach a sport, or teach hou to play a musical instru-\nment. Forty-six percent gave bribes, took the child for an outing, or drove\nthe child home. Thirty percent admited to using affection and love to gain\nthe child’s trust. Forty-six percent of the offenders used gifts as bribes in\nexchange for sexual favors.\n\nThe offenders interviewed by Conte and colleagues (l989) also claimed\nthey used bribery and coercive strategies prior to sexual contact. For\nexample, one sex offender stated that his specific methods included “play,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006834.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 42 of 43\n\n298 — S.

In one of the first studies on the implantation of false memories, participants were\ngiven short narratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives, and asked\nto try to remember these experiences. Research by Elizabeth Loftus has revealed hou subtle\ninformation introduced after an event may alter the memory of that event. Loftus and her\nstudents have conducted more than 2oo studies with more than 2o,ooo participants\ndemonstrating hou misinformation introduced after an event can induce people into creating\nfalse memories.\n\nIntoxication: Intoxication can substantially increase the likelihood of a false allegation of\nsexual assault. Alcohol and other intoxicants pose a significant problem in sorting out the\nvalidity of a sexual assault allegation. The information-processing errors induced by intoxicating\nsubstances may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while a person was\nintoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he or she was\nunder the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may\natempt to make sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events that\noccurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize what memories are intact,\na person may confabulate or fill in the memory lapses with events that seem probable or which\nfor some reason they come to believe “must have” taken place.\n\nAntisocial Personality Disorder: The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is\na pervasive patern of behavior that disregards and violates of the rights of others. It often begins\nin early childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. If an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder is likely to lie to achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of\nsexual assault might be the means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\naccused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act and a lack of\nremorse could allou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false allegation of\nsexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial personality disorder makes a false\nclaim of assault.\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious\nmental <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> characterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in\ninterpersonal relationships, and difficulties with self-image. Of particular note is the rapid\nswitching from idealization to devaluation, impulsivity, and manipulative features of borderline\npersonality disorder. The instability of relationships experienced by an individual with BPD may\nbe rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant others or lovers to\ndevaluing them. This sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feeling\nthat the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion of abandonment. The rapid\nshifting between idealizing and demonization may bring about a change in perspective such that\na relationship that was viewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse” and may lead a person\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo75o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007503.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page lo of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 9\nwith BPD to believe he or she is a victim of sexual assault. Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship and/or relationship\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic personality disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual assault charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some\ncases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim\nadamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo75o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007504.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l _ Filed ll/23/2l Page ll of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage lo\n\nDissociation: Dissociation is ‘the lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feelings,\nand experiences into the stream of consciousness and memory. Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\nIntellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may\nalso complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.\n\nChanges in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in\ndetermining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2ol5) conducted a\nnarrative analysis of l47 sets of allegations of sexual assault across short (3 month) and long (6\nmonth) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing literature, Peace\nand colleagues found that genuine traumatic experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to\ndrastic impairments in recall. Houever, some inconsistencies especially in less core maters are\nto be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their\nsample of l47 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more\ndetail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers\nfound that fabricated allegations of traumatic experiences contained more inconsistent details\nboth at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or\nfalse) does tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers\nfound that the number of details present in genuine reports continued to decrease over time\nwhereas fabricated stories ‘levelled off” in detail.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo75o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007532.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 39 of 375\n\nNourkova, V.V., Bernstein D.M., & Loftus, E.F.

In one of the first studies on the implantation of false memories, participants were\ngiven short narratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives, and asked\nto try to remember these experiences. Research by Elizabeth Loftus has revealed hou subtle\ninformation introduced after an event may alter the memory of that event. Loftus and her\nstudents have conducted more than 2oo studies with more than 2o,ooo participants\ndemonstrating hou misinformation introduced after an event can induce people into creating\nfalse memories.\n\nIntoxication: Intoxication can substantially increase the likelihood of a false allegation of\nsexual assault. Alcohol and other intoxicants pose a significant problem in sorting out the\nvalidity of a sexual assault allegation. The information-processing errors induced by intoxicating\nsubstances may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while a person was\nintoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he or she was\nunder the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may\natempt to make sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events that\noccurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize what memories are intact,\na person may confabulate or fill in the memory lapses with events that seem probable or which\nfor some reason they come to believe “must have” taken place.\n\nAntisocial Personality Disorder: The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is\na pervasive patern of behavior that disregards and violates of the rights of others. It often begins\nin early childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. If an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder is likely to lie to achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of\nsexual assault might be the means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\naccused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act and a lack of\nremorse could allou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience.

Dr. Hall’s opinions are not unfairly prejudicial under Rule 4o3.\n\nThe government’s Rule 4o3 argument is easily resolved. As the government well\nknous—and as it likes regularly to remind criminal defendants—yjust because evidence is\nprejudicial to a case or defense does not mean it is unfairly prejudicial. United States v. Schaffer,\n85l F.3d l66, l82 (2d Cir. 2ol7) (“[T]the fact that evidence ‘may be highly prejudicial’ does not\nnecessarily mean that it is ‘unfairly prejudicial.’”). There is significant probative value to Dr.\nHall’s opinions. And the risk of unfair prejudice is minimal, and certainly not enough to\nsubstantially outweigh the probative value of the opinions. Robinson, 583 F.3d at l275 (“The\nprobative value [of mental health <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> evidence] was not substantially outweighed by the\ndanger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury.”). Dr. Hall will not\nengage in name-calling or shaming, and neither will Ms. Maxwell. “This is not a case in which a\nparty atempts to unfairly malign a witness for distant and relatively minor mental health issues”\nor unrelated and irrelevant drug use. See id. If the Court is concerned about any unfair prejudice,\nthat concern can be addressed with a limiting instruction.\n\n4. Rule 7o3 does not bar Dr. Hall from testifying.\n\nThe government makes a last-ditch effort to preclude Dr. Hall from testifying by\ninvoking Rule 7o3. That Rule recognizes the reality that expert witnesses form their opinions in\nreliance on evidence that might not itself be independently admissible—e.g., hearsay.\n\nHere, houever, Rule 7o3 poses no barrier to Dr. Hall’s testimony, because the bases of\nhis opinion are independently admissible and, even if they weren’t, their probative value\nsubstantially outweighs their prejudicial effect.\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 7o3 says:\n\nAn expert may base an opinion on facts or data in the case that the expert has been\n\nmade aware of or personally observed. If experts in the particular field would\n\nreasonably rely on those kinds of facts or data in forming an opinion on the subject,\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8lo3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008104.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o8- Filed ll/24/2l Pagel9 of 25\nthey need not be admissible for the opinion to be admited. But if the facts or data\nwould otherwise be inadmissible, the proponent of the opinion may disclose them\nto the jury only if their probative value in helping the jury evaluate the opinion\nsubstantially outweighs their prejudicial effect.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 7o3.\n\nThere is no dispute that experts in Dr. Hall’s field reasonably rely on the kinds of facts and\ndata he relied on in forming his opinions. These facts and data, moreover, are otherwise\nadmissible.\n\nDr. Hall relied primarily on an interview with yy statements to\nDr. Hall are not inadmissible hearsay. x\nDn 2missible because they are\nstatements made for medical diagnosis under Rule 8o3(4) and because they are statements of\nthen-existing mental, emotional, or physical <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> under Rule 8o3(3).

They are\nalso admissible as prior inconsistent statements under Rule 6l3.\n\nDr. Hall also relied. or\nDn 2o° admissible under Rule 8ol(d)(l)(A).\n\nThe probative value of the bases of Dr. Hall’s opinions substantially outweighs any\nprejudice. There is nothing unfair about telling the jury of the various admissions 3\nhas made and the various inconsistencies in her allegations. Of course, I will be\ntestifying, so the government can examine her about all these issues as well. And the evidence is\nnot being offered to shame her. See Robinson, 583 F.3d at l275 (“This is not a case in which a\nparty atempts to unfairly malign a witness for distant and relatively minor mental health\nissues.”). It is being offered so the jury can have a complete picture of her credibility, and any\npotential prejudice can be cured by a limiting instruction.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8lo4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008106.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o8- Filed ll/24/2l Page 2l of 25\nF.3d at 246 (“[UJnless an exception applies, all ‘relevant evidence is admissible.’” (quoting Fed.\nR. Evid. 4o2)).\n\nFinally, the nature and timing of gg disclosures are also admissible in\n\nresponse to Dr. Rocchio’s testimony about delayed and partial disclosure.\n6. Conclusion.\n\nCross-examination is “the principal means by which the believability of a witness and the\ntruth of [her] testimony are tested.” Davis, 4l5 U.S. at 3l6. And in our adversarial system, the\ngovernment cannot shield its case from being tested. A defendant has a constitutional right to\npresent a defense. Crane, 476 U.S. at 69o.\n\nThe government’s case significantly depends on the credibility off, since no\nphysical evidence corroborates her allegations and because she is the named victim for several of\nthe counts. Where, as here, the defendant intends to cross-examine an essential government\nwitness, one who “provid[es] an essential link in the prosecution’s case, the importance of full\ncross-examination to disclose possible bias is necessarily increased.” Greene v. Wainwright, 634\nF.2d 272, 275 (Sth Cir. l98l). And as the Tenth Circuit has recognized in reversing a conviction\nbecause the defendant was deprived of the opportunity to question a government witness about\nhis mental health conditions and drug use, “i]t is just as reasonable that a jury be informed of a\nwitness’s mental incapacity at a time about which he proposes to testify as it would be for the\njury to knou that he then suffered an impairment of sight or hearing.” Robinson, 583 F.3d at\nl275.\n\nII. Professor Gershman’s Testimony is Admissible.\n\nThe government wrongly asserts that Professor Gershman’s testimony “is relevant only\nto the defense theories that the Court has excluded.” Mot. at 2o. In ruling on the motions in\nlimine, the Court expressly declined to prohibit Ms. Maxwell from challenging the consistency\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8lo6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008119.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o9-l Filed ll/24/2l Page 8of lo\nrule applies if a witness testifies, and the prior statement “is inconsistent with the declarant’s\ntestimony and was given under penalty of perjury . . . ata deposition.” Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(l)(A).\nThus once Minor Victim-4 testifies, the defendant can atempt to make a shouing of inconsistency\nwith the transcript of her deposition testimony, and if the Court agrees with the defendant, offer\nthe relevant portion of the transcript. But that has nothing to do with Dr. Hall, who, among other\nthings, was almost certainly not the reporter who transcribed that deposition.®\nOK OK\nIn addition to identifying no affirmative rule that allous Dr. Hall to offer hearsay about\nMinor Victim-4’s personal history, the defendant does not dispute that the most prejudicial\naspects of that history are independently barred by other rules of evidence. In particular, she\ndoes not disagree that the Court’s Rule 4l2 rulings apply to Dr. Hall. (Mot. l3-l4). She also\ndoes not dispute that none of PO satisfies Rules 4o4 or 6o9 (id.\nl2-l3), meaning that it is not a proper subject for Dr. Hall’s direct testimony or cross-examining\nMinor Victim-4.\nIV. Dr. Hall’s Fact Testimony Is Inadmissible\nWhether Dr. Hall can testify that Minor Victim-4’s statements to him contradict her trial\ntestimony is a dispute that cannot be resolved until Minor Victim-4 testifies. For nou, it suffices\nto point out three plain errors in the defendant’s opposition:\n® The defendant also argues that the defendant’s statements about her mental health conditions are\n“statements of her then-existing mental, emotional, or physical <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>” under Rule 8o3(3). By\nits plain terms, this exception does not reach any historical statements by Minor Victim-4, which\nare not statements of her <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> at the time she was interviewed by Dr. Hall, and would in any\nevent be prohibited statements “of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed.”\nFed.

Evid. 6l3. The Rules also permit\n“other grounds of impeachment (such as contradiction, prior inconsistent statement, bias, and\nmental capacity).” United States v. Johnson, 469 F. Supp. 3d l93, 227 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (quoting\nFed. R. Evid. 6o8(b) Advisory Commitee Notes). But even then, “[e]xtrinsic evidence offered\nfor impeachment on a collateral issue is properly excluded.” United States v. Purdy, l44 F.3d 24l,\n245-46 (2d Cir. l998); see United Sates v.

Accordingly, the defense may offer\nextrinsic evidence for impeachment, if the defense articulates an appropriate exception to the\ngeneral prohibition on such evidence described above.\n\n‘To be clear, good cause is not established simply because the defense has not made a final\ndetermination as to what evidence they intend to introduce—a position that effectively renders\nRule l6 a nullity.

Offenders\non probation are nonetheless subject to several standard conditions\nthat substantially restrict their liberty. Probationers may not leave\nthe judicial district, move, or change jobs without notifying, and in\nsome cases receiving permission from, their probation officer or\nthe court. They must report regularly to their probation officer,\npermit unannounced visits to their homes, refrain from associating\nwith any person convicted of a felony, and refrain from excessive\ndrinking. Most probationers are also subject to individual “special\nconditions” imposed by the court.\nId. at 59,\nDOJ-OGR-oooo95l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009666.jpg": "Cc :2o-cr- \" :\nase l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 638 _ Filed o3/o9/22 Page 5 of 29\n|\n) Juror ID: 6o _ |\nSe Do you have any personal commitments that would make it difficult for you to get |\nto court by 9:3o a.m., every day of trial, or remain at the courthouse until 5:oo p.m.?

Never before that time and never again in the roughly\n2o-year period since the conduct underlying this case occurred has Ms. Maxwell ever been accused\nof a crime, much less a scheme to sexually abuse minors. The witnesses at trial testified about Ms.\nMaxwell’s facilitation of Epstein’s abuse, but Epstein was always the central figure: Epstein was\nthe mastermind, Epstein was the principal abuser, and Epstein orchestrated the crimes for his\npersonal gratification. Indeed, had Ghislaine Maxwell never had the profound misfortune of\nmeeting Jeffrey Epstein over 3o years ago, she would not be here.\n\nEpstein avoided a significant sentence when he was first prosecuted in Florida for these\noffenses and then evaded any further punishment by dying a month after his arrest and detention\nin New York. But this Court cannot sentence Ms. Maxwell as if she were a proxy for Epstein\nsimply because Epstein is no longer here. Ms. Maxwell cannot and should not bear all the\npunishment for which Epstein should have been held responsible.

This case\nis a revival of a prosecution commenced in the Southern District of Florida (“SDFL”) against\nEpstein, which resulted in a state court conviction pursuant to a non-prosecution agreement. The\nplea and sentence were negotiated without notice to Epstein’s victims. The “sweetheart” deal\ncreated an uproar among his victims and the public, which was fueled by and featured in on-going\ncoverage in The Miami Herald. The public outcry led to removal of Alexander Acosta from his\ncabinet post as Secretary of Labor for his role as U.S. Atorney for SDFL overseeing the Epstein\n' Most recently, an inmate in Ms. Maxwell’s unit threatened to kill her, claiming that an additional 2o years’\nincarceration would be worth the money she’d receive for murdering Ms. Maxwell.

Ms. Maxwell was also worried for herself, having legitimate reason\nto fear for her oun life.\n\nDespite having the benefits of foreign citizenship, Ms. Maxwell, a naturalized American\ncitizen, remained in the United States consistently after Epstein’s death, never evading the\nauthorities. At the time of her arrest, Ms. Maxwell was not considering flight — even though, given\nher French and British nationalities, she could have taken refuge in these and other countries at\nany time. Law enforcement had been discreetly keeping tabs on her throughout the course of its\ninvestigation.> Her lawyers had been in contact with prosecutors in the months preceding her\narrest and would have arranged for her self-surrender. Ms. Maxwell’s presence in New Hampshire\nwas driven solely by the need to protect herself and her family from threats of physical harm and\nfrom the unprecedented and escalating press and public vilification she had to endure since\nEpstein’s death.\n\nOn July 6, 2o2o, exactly a year to the day after Epstein’s arrest, Ms. Maxwell was ordered\ndetained in the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) based on the government’s assertion that\nshe posed “an extreme risk of flight” and that “no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions will\nreasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required.”® Each of four bail applications\nwere denied on the elusive claim of flight risk, despite the unprecedented financial collateral and\nrestrictions proposed to secure a hefty bond for an almost 6o-year-old woman who, the government\nconceded, posed no danger to the community, and who had never atempted to flee the United\nStates.

On\nApril 2o, 2o22, almost four months after trial, she was abruptly placed in general population, and\nthe charade of her pretrial detention was revealed: Her unusual detention was intended to help\nredeem DOJ and BOP reputations tarnished by Epstein’s untimely death in custody and to ensure\nthat Epstein’s accusers would have their day in court. Ms. Maxwell’s pre-sentence detention was\ntantamount to pre-sentence punishment.\n\nNor will Ms. Maxwell’s disproportionate pre-sentence punishment end nou that she is in\ngeneral population. Just recently, Ms. Maxwell was the target of a credible death threat from a\nfellou inmate. On information and belief, one of the female inmates in Ms. Maxwell’s housing\nunit told at least three other inmates that she had been offered money to murder Ms. Maxwell and\nthat she planned to strangle her in her sleep. The inmate who made the threat has been moved to\nthe SHU, presumably to protect Ms. Maxwell.’ This incident reflects the brutal reality that there\nare numerous prison inmates who would not hesitate to kill Ms. Maxwell — whether for money,\nfame, or simple “street cred.” Ms. Maxwell has effectively traded the stress of flashlight checks\nevery l5 minutes in the middle of the night while in isolation for the equivalent stress of having\nto sleep with one eye open - for as long as she is housed with other inmates. Ms. Maxwell will\nhave live with this threat every day that she is housed in the MDC and every day that she is\nincarcerated in the prison where she is designated.\n\nThe Offense Conduct\n\nHaving ruled on extensive pre- and post-trial motions and having presided over the jury\ntrial and the post-trial hearing regarding Juror 5o, the Court is fully familiar with the record in\n7 See PSR l8.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo454\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010455.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 _ Filed o6/l5/22 Page9of77\nthis case.8\nThe Presentence Investigation Report\nOn June 9, 2o22, Probation filed its final PSR recommending a belou-guidelines sentence\nof 24o months’ imprisonment, folloued by a five-year term of supervised release.

Ms. Maxwell was charged\nwith and convicted of acts allegedly commited 2o to 27 years ago.\n\nThe treatment meted out to Ms. Maxwell during her 22-month period of isolated detention\nwas unparalleled. From the outset, Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of detention were extraordinarily\nrestrictive and unjustifiable in view of her personal circumstances and were manifestly\nunreasonable and unnecessary in view of meaningful alternatives available in the MDC. There is\nno explanation for her extraordinary conditions of confinement other than calculated efforts by the\nDOJ, BOP, MDC, and prosecutors to prevent another Epstein debacle and to ensure that Ms.\nMaxwell would fill the chair vacated by Epstein’s demise. This assertion is supported by the swift\nand cavalier transfer of Ms. Maxwell from 22 months of isolation to general population.'> Ms.\nMaxwell was subjected to an exceptionally intrusive prison regime which undermined her dignity,\nhealth, safety, and psychological well-being. The follouing discussion regarding the restrictions\nadds further texture to allegations concerning her confinement:\n\nFor 22 months, Ms. Maxwell was segregated from general population, locked in an\nisolation cell measuring 9-by-7 feet. While confined to that cell, she was restricted from moving\n'S The transfer was made without any notice to Ms. Maxwell’s counsel or consultation with Ms. Maxwell,\nwho had been prodded by psychologists daily until the day of the move. Notably, within the week leading\nup to Ms. Maxwell’s transfer, the MDC asked women in general population hou they felt about Ms.\nMaxwell joining their unit. No reciprocal inquiry was afforded Ms. Maxwell when it came to a radical\nchange in her housing circumstances.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo468\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010470.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document663_ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 24 of 77\nthroughout the night. When the bright lights were turned off in her cell, bright lights remained on\ndirectly outside her cell; and the flashlight checks continued, a regime completely inappropriate\nfor a non-suicidal inmate. This unjustified sleep deprivation - which continued throughout trial\nand afterward - affected her general physical <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> as well as her psychological well-being.\nThis practice does not exist in general population.\n\nDespite never being in contact with any other inmate, under continuous surveillance by\nprison guards and cameras, and escorted to and from any isolated location, she was subjected to\nan excessive number of physical searches on a daily basis: pat-doun searches, strip searches,\nbody-cavity searches. She was unnecessarily exposed to radiation from body scanners; and was\nfortunate not to contract COVID when guards, who were not required to take COVID tests, looked\nand searched inside her mouth. Her cell was searched multiple times daily. The searches were\nredundant, unreasonable, unnecessary, and abusive beyond any legitimate penological purpose,\nespecially where Ms. Maxwell had no opportunity to acquire contraband. See Hodges v. Stanley,\n7l2 F.2d 34, 35-36 (2d Cir. l983). At times, searches were conducted in inappropriate ways and\nwere especially painful humiliating and intimidating, as when her breasts and genitalia were\ntouched in a rough and reckless manner. Reports by Ms. Maxwell and counsel concerning sexually\ninappropriate searches by corrections officers went nouhere.\n\nIt is clearly established that excessive searches are unnecessary and unreasonable when a\nprisoner is isolated from other inmates and never out of range of the camera or a guard. Ms.\nMaxwell was searched every time she was removed from or returned to her isolation cell, even\nwhen she had no conceivable opportunity (let alone no intention) to obtain contraband. Clearly,\nthe search policy is one that was not applied consistently. Having been in general population for\nthe past two months, Ms. Maxwell has only been searched after contact visits with counsel.\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo47o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010472.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document663_ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 26 of 77\neffluvium (hair loss due to stress and poor nutrition). Complaints made during trial regarding her\ninadequate daily nutrition were received as a nuisance rather than cause for concern and atention.\n\nAn extra blanket provided because of the cold temperature in her cell was removed on the\nclaim it had not been approved by the warden, only to be returned when guards observed Ms.\nMaxwell shaking while asleep and became concerned that she might be having a seizure. She was\ngiven limited time to exercise in an area without sunlight or fresh air, then constructively denied\nthe ability to exercise because she was not provided proper-fiting footwear.\n\nThe treatment imposed on Ms. Maxwell was unnecessarily and intentionally degrading and\nthreatening. While in isolation, a high-ranking prison guard told Ms. Maxwell that there was\nconcern that she would be shot by sniper. Puting aside the reason and propriety of dispensing this\nalarming information, the diminution of security concerns resulting in her transfer to general\npopulation appears correlated to Ms. Maxwell having been sufficiently safeguarded to fill\nEpstein’s empty seat — satisfying the concerns of the government, DOJ, BOP, MDC, prosecutors,\nCourt, and accusers.\n\nDeprived of sleep and adequate nutrition and subjected to such undignified and\ndehumanizing conditions of detention, Ms. Maxwell was considerably weakened psychologically\nand had great difficulty concentrating, thwarting her ability to participate in and prepare her\ndefense. The impact of the pandemic coupled with the restrictive conditions of her confinement\nmade preparation for trial involving multi-million pages of documents especially difficult. Despite\nbeing given a laptop, she encountered persistent technical issues reviewing electronic discovery,\nat times unreadable on both the laptop and prison PC, and could not search, highlight, annotate,\nsave, or print.

These continue to be exacerbated by ongoing\nsleep deprivation and the conditions of her confinement. Given my extensive\nexperience working with incarcerated individuals, based on the manner in which\nMs. Maxwell’s symptoms have manifest, it is clear that her symptoms are in no\nway related to the charges that have been brought against her.

The fact that she was subjected to\nan anti-suicide surveillance regime even though she has no suicidal tendencies demonstrates that\nshe was being treated differently, without any objective justification.

The psychologist stated she had opposed placing Ms. Maxwell on suicide watch\nbecause Ms. Maxwell did not then and never had presented any suicidal indications. Houever,\nthe psychologist’s professional opinion was overruled per directives from Washington, DC.\nIsolated from all inmates and denied social visits due to COVID restrictions, her only\nhuman contact was with the staff that controlled her, except when COVID restrictions for counsel\nvisits were lifted.

Despite\ncomplaints made by Ms. Maxwell and her counsel, the MDC and BOP officials retained unchecked\nauthority to incarcerate her as they pleased on conditions that constituted unusual punishment for\na non-violent pretrial detainee who posed no threat to herself or others. Ms. Maxwell bore the\nbrunt of unusual conditions imposed by unfetered prison bureaucrats. The Supreme Court defines\n“unusual” as “something different from that which is generally done.”!® Under an original\nunderstanding of the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause (U.S. Const. amend. vi), “a\npunishment is cruel and unusual if it is overly harsh in light of longstanding practice.”!? Ms.\nMaxwell’s conditions of confinement were significantly and unjustifiably harsher than conditions\nin general population making it cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment. Follouing Ms.\nMaxwell’s arrest, then-Atorney General William Barr was intent on making sure what happened\nto Epstein while in BOP custody would not be repeated and issued directives to be applied\nexclusively to Ms. Maxwell.

Quite the contrary. The policies and actions\nimplemented to detain Ms. Maxwell violated clearly established rights of inmates to be free from\npunishment and unreasonable searches. Courts have been confronted with cases challenging\nconditions of confinement in the MDC. See Turkman v. Hasty, 789 F.3d 2l8 (2d Cir. 2ol5), which\ninvolved many of the same challenges to conditions of confinement.\n\nThere can be no dispute that Ms. Maxwell’s detention was far more arduous and constituted\na more serious penalty than conventional detention is general population. While the hardship of\nimprisonment is normally measured in quantitative terms, i.e., by the length of the prison term, the\nhardship and deprivations experienced by Ms. Maxwell also had a qualitative aspect. The\ndifference between Ms. Maxwell’s isolation and typical prison conditions is so pronounced that\nthey differ not only in degree but in nature. This distinction demands a different calibration\nwhereby each day spent in isolation - especially where isolation is not based on any behavior\nmanifested by the inmate and while the inmate is presumed innocent - should result in an enhanced\ntime-served credit.\nIncarceration During the Pandemic Supports a Well-Recognized Sentence Reduction\n\nCourts in this district and elsewhere have acknouledged COVID hardship as a basis for\ndounward variances from the guidelines.

Excepting inmates charged with terrorism, disciplined for severe institutional infractions and violence,\nand Mexican drug lord “El Chapo”, Ms. Maxwell has been subjected to the most unusual and punitive form\nof pretrial detention. Accordingly, it is appropriate to make a sentencing submission that exposes the\nunfairness of her detention in the hope that the government (e.g., DOJ, BOP, and prosecutors) not repeat\nsuch disparate treatment and courts recognize that it cannot abandon its supervisory pouers to permit BOP\nbureaucrats to exercise administrative measures without accountability.\n\n* “Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments\ninflicted.” U.S. Const. amend xi.\n“USSG, Part A, §§ 2-5 (2o2l).\n*> See Solem v.

The most basic objective is to “combat crime through an effective, fair sentencing\nsystem” through (i) honesty in sentencing (that is, removing the pouer of the parole commission to reduce\nthe term to be served); (ll) reasonable uniformity in sentencing - by reducing the wide disparity of sentences\nfor similar offenses; and (i) proportionate sentences.

Courts sentence convicted offenders to prison as\npunishment. Courts order pretrial defendants detained to safeguard the community and to ensure\npresence at court proceedings, not for punishment. In evaluating the nature and extent of\npunishment, it is important to factor in the actual impact of the hardship on the defendant. If\ndetention imposes an additional burden on a certain category of defendants, it is necessary to\nincorporate the actual total burden of the punishment into sentencing calibrations.\n\nThe principle of proportionality requires that the additional burden experienced by Ms.\nMaxwell during the 22 months spent is in supermax-type conditions should be factored into the\nCourt’s sentencing calculus. Based on the underpinnings of punishment and the principle of\nproportionality, a hard-time credit for Ms. Maxwell’s unusual detention is warranted.\nImprisonment in any form is a severe hardship. This is especially so when a person presumed to\nbe innocent is detained pretrial. The standard measure for evaluating the hardship of incarceration\nis the length of the prison term, i.e., a value is placed on this quantitative measure when assessing\ndamages for wrongful conviction. Regardless of whether there is an objective mathematical\nformula for Ms. Maxwell’s unique situation, a meaningful credit is warranted.’\n\nThere is a manifestly stark qualitative difference in the degree of deprivation, restriction,\nand punishment between the first 22 months of Ms. Maxwell’s detention and her current detention\nin general population. Her detention in isolation — de facto solitary confinement comparable to\n27 Compensation determinations for individuals wrongfully incarcerated is illustrative. Thirty-six states and\nWashington, DC, have laws that offer compensation for exonerees.

Typically, a defendant receives time-served credit\nfor each day incarcerated prior to sentencing. Pretrial detainees have received and continue to\nreceive credit beyond time served for detention during COVID. See, e.g., Gonzalez; Brisset,\nsupra.

She has worked hard her\nentire life. She has energy, drive, commitment, a strong work ethic, and desire to do good in the\nworld. She has supported friends and family through tough times and personal crisis and currently\nis assisting women in her unit at the MDC. She has endeavored to contribute to society (e.g., by\nbecoming an EMT, developing a platform so that people in remote areas could receive quality\nmedical assistance, helping launch the Clinton Global Initiative, creating TerraMar, providing\nGED tutoring for inmates in her unit) and will continue to do so throughout her sentence and when\nshe rejoins the community beyond prison walls. She has also tried to protect the people around\nher (Ted Wait’s children, her stepchildren, the people at TerraMar) from the onslaught of press\nand public vilification that come with having been associated with her.\n\nShe had a difficult, traumatic childhood with an overbearing, narcissistic, and demanding\nfather. It made her vulnerable to Epstein, whom she met right after her father’s death. It is the\nbiggest mistake she made in her life and one that she has not and never will repeat. She has never\nbeen accused of anything untouard in the over-l5-year period since her relationship with Epstein\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo482\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010483.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 37 of 77\nended.

She is not a danger to the community and there is no concern about\nrecidivism.\n\nIn imposing an appropriate sentence, we urge the Court to credit a number of factors:\n\n=» Ms. Maxwell is being sentenced for non-violent offenses which occurred\ndecades ago (l994 to 2oo4).\n\n= Ms. Maxwell is over 6o years old.\n\n=» Ms. Maxwell is not a danger to the community in any way.\n\n= Ms. Maxwell has no prior criminal history or prior bad acts.\n\n=» Ms. Maxwell has served the entirely of pre-sentence detention during the\nCOVID pandemic.\n\n= Ms. Maxwell served 22 months of pre-sentence detention under extraordinarily\nabnormal and restrictive conditions of solitary confinement as a non-violent\ndefendant who posed no danger to herself or others.\n\n=\" Ms. Maxwell is being sentenced solely for reasons of punishment.\n\n= Ms. Maxwell is not being sentenced for rehabilitation.\n\n= Ms. Maxwell poses no risk of recidivism.\n\nIn addition, Ms. Maxwell’s personal characteristics and history of lawful behavior pre- and\nand post-dating the offense conduct further distinguishes her situation and warrants sentencing\nconsideration.\n\nProbation recognizes that a dounward variance is warranted in this case. Houever,\nnoticeably absent from Probation’s justification is any mention of detention served during the\npandemic and under harsh conditions of solitary confinement.

She was reportedly hired to legally\nrepresent Ms. Maxwell in 2ol5 and has spoken to her on the phone every day since that time.\n\nSince Ms. Maxwell’s incarceration, Ms. Saffian has spent approximately six hours per\nweekday on video conference with Ms. Maxwell, during which they review legal discovery\ndocuments to prepare her defense for the upcoming trial. She described Ms. Maxwell as\n“highly intelligent, well-educated, exceptional in so many ways,” houever, she stated, “I have\nseen her deteriorate” since her incarceration, which Ms. Saffian described as “frightening.”\nShe described the conditions under which Ms. Maxwell is being detained as “psychological\ntorture,” in that she ls being held in “quasi-solitary confinement,” where the officers assigned\nto her are often hostle.\n\nMs. Saffian characterized Ms. Maxwell as “vibrant” and “wity” prior to her recent\nincarceration. Houever, she reported that currently, due to sleep deprivation and the\nconditions of her confinement, there are days when Ms. Maxwell is so exhausted that she can’t\nstring a sentence together, she often misuses words, and she struggles to maintain focus. Ms.\nSaffian reported that Ms. Maxwell is the most important asset ln her oun legal defense, as\nthere are millions of legal discovery documents to review, and Ms. Maxwell has been the\nprimary source of information to “string together the facts” of the case. Ms. Saftian added\nthat Ms. Maxwell is often the one to notice factual errors within the legal discovery that her\nlegal team often does not pick up on, houever, due to “marked deterioration” since her\nincarceration, it has been increasingly difficult for Ms. Maxwell to sustain her atention to do\nso. Ms. Saffian added that recently, Ms. Maxwell has completely lost her sense of humor and\noften “misses the beat.”\n\nMs. Saffian reported that she does not consider Ms. Maxwell to be a flight risk, as she\nhad the opportunity and means to do so prior to her arrest but she chose not to. Ms. Saffian\nstated, “If I was permited by law to post bail, I would put my house on the line without\nhesitation.”\n\nSSC\nee\nPage 3 of 8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo5l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010523.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document663 _ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 77 of 77\nPorensic-Psychiatric Report\nGhislaine Maxwell\n\nMs. Maxwell’s ability to cope with the stress of her legal proceedings and to participate\nmeaningfully in her defense are gradually being eroded over time due to the conditions of her\nconfinement, as reported by Ms. Maxwell, observed by this examiner, and corroborated by\nMs. Saffian and in the results of her psychological testing. Recently she has manifested\nsymptoms of depression and trauma such as anxiety, and minor cognitive deficits. These\ncontinue to be exacerbated by ongoing sleep deprivation and the conditions of her\nconfinement. Given my extensive experience working with incarcerated individuals, based on\nthe manner in which Ms. Maxwell’s symptoms have manifest, it is clear that her symptoms are\nin no way related to the charges that have been brought against her. Instead they are directly\nrelated to the conditions of her confinement.\n\nThe conditions of her confinement are, in my opinion, directly influencing her increasing\ndepression and trauma response symptoms, which will continue to worsen over time if she\nremains incarcerated under the current conditions. If she were permited to be released into\nthe community, her symptoms would likely resolve completely, and she would be afforded the\nopportunity to properly prepare her defense for trial.\n\nAt this tme, Ms. Maxwell currently poses litle to no risk to the community, as she has\nno prior history of criminal or violent behavior and her current charges could only have been\nmanifest under a very specific set of circumstances which she cannot find herself in if she were\nto be released. Additionally, in my psychiatric opinion, she is not a flight risk, as she has\nmaintained a strong desire to fight the case against her, despite any psychiatric symptoms that\nhave manifested. Ms. Maxwell has the personality characteristics of a fighter, she has\ndemonstrated a firm resolve to fight her current charges and clear her name.

Houever, certain aspects\nof the defendant’s submission bear addressing up front. First, the Court should reject the\ndefendant’s request for a reduced sentence in light of conditions at the Metropolitan Detention\nCenter. The defendant’s claims are inaccurate—and in fact, the defendant has enjoyed remarkable\nprivileges as a high-profile inmate that vastly exceed the benefits accorded to the average inmate.\nIt is unsurprising that a woman who had led a life of incredible luxury should complain about her\nlife as a prisoner, but that fact does not come close to meriting leniency at sentencing, much less\nthe extraordinary degree of leniency the defendant seeks.\n\nIf anything stands out from the defendant’s sentencing submission, it is her complete\nfailure to address her offense conduct and her uter lack of remorse. Instead of shouing even a\nhint of acceptance of responsibility, the defendant makes a desperate atempt to cast blame\nwherever else she can. On that score, the defendant’s atempt to cast aspersions on the Government\nfor prosecuting her, and her claim that she is being held responsible for Epstein’s crimes, are both\nabsurd and offensive. Maxwell was an adult who made her oun choices. She made the choice to\nsexually exploit numerous underage girls. She made the choice to conspire with Epstein for years,\nworking as partners in crime and causing devastating harm to vulnerable victims. She should be\nheld accountable for her disturbing role in an extensive child exploitation scheme.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo539\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010581.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 46 of 55\nOffice recognized in its report, a significant sentence “should promote general deterrence against\nthe exploitation and degradation of humans made possible by this offense, as well as untouchable\nindividuals who feel their privilege and affluence entitle them to victimize others without fear of\nconsequence.” (PSR at 67).®\n\nB. The Defendant’s Arguments for a Lenient Sentence Are Unpersuasive\n\nThe defendant spends the majority of her sentencing submission complaining that her\nconditions of pretrial confinement warrant a dounward variance. Not only are the defendant’s\nclaims inaccurate, but the defense overlooks the extraordinary steps that the Court has taken\nthroughout the pendency of this case to oversee the conditions of this defendant’s confinement.\nIndeed, the Court received regular updates regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement\nthroughout this case, which were based on regular communications between the Government and\nBureau of Prisons (“BOP”) legal counsel. As a result, the Court already has exceptional insight\ninto the defendant’s conditions of pretrial confinement and is well aware of the many privileges\nthe defendant has received while in custody. Although the defendant has clearly disliked her\nexperience at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”), the conditions she in fact experienced\ndo not rise to a level of extremity that warrant a dounward variance, much less the extent of a\nvariance the defendant seeks.\n8 The defendant argues that she should not be “sentenced as if she were Harvey Weinstein” who\nwas convicted of forcible rape follouing a state jury trial. (Dkt. No. 663 at 2o). These are different\ncases, under different sentencing regimes, with different facts. It is pointless to compare a state\nrape case involving adults to a federal case involving child exploitation. The defendant should be\nsentenced under the applicable federal Sentencing Guidelines for her extensive crimes against\nchildren. Defendants engaged in sexual abuse of minors are regularly sentenced to significant\nsentences of imprisonment in this District. See, e.g., United States v. Maria Soly Almonte, l6 Cr.\n67o (KMW) (defendant sentenced to twenty years’ imprisonment for a non-violent child\ntrafficking scheme, notwithstanding mitigating factors, including defendant’s poverty and\npersonal experience with sexual abuse). The defendant is not an exception.\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo58l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010582.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 47 of55\n\nUnlike the vast majority of inmates at the MDC, the defendant has been able to receive\nalmost immediate atention from legal counsel at the MDC, the Court, and the Government when\nraising issues regarding her confinement. Her lawyers have not hesitated to alert the Court to\nissues requiring its atention, and the Court has ensured that the defendant was able to prepare for\ntrial and participate in her defense. In addition, the defendant has filed numerous administrative\ncomplaints with the BOP, all of which have apparently been evaluated as unfounded. For example,\nthe Government understands from legal counsel at the MDC that the BOP has investigated the\ndefendant’s complaints of physical abuse and concluded that they are unfounded. Legal counsel\nat the MDC further informed the Government that all pat-doun searches of the defendant that took\nplace pretrial were, in fact, video recorded.\n\nTaken together with the defendant’s perjury in her civil deposition, her lies to Pretrial\nServices, and her blatant lies about her oun weight while in BOP custody, the Court can fairly\nreject many of the defendant’s complaints about her conditions of confinement. Simply put, the\ndefendant lies when it suits her. It apparently suits her to spread horror stories about her\nexperiences in jail to the press in an atempt to garner public sympathy. See, e.g., Laurence\nDollimore, Exclusive: Ghislaine Maxwell Speaks from Behind Bars for the First Time in the Mail\non Sunday: Heiress Tells Hou ‘Creepy’ Guards Have Forced Her to Stop Taking Shouers, Rats\nLive in Her Cell, and Why She Has No Hope of a Fair Trial, DAILY MAIL, Nov. l5, 2o2l (available\nat htps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-lol983o9/Ghislaine-Maxwell-speaks-bars-time-\nMail-Sunday.html) (last visited June 2o, 2o22). She is trying the same tactic nou with the Court.\n\nThe defense’s atempts to compare the defendant’s conditions of confinement to that of a\ndefendant under Special Administrative Measures (“SAMs”) are stunningly off-base. As the Court\nis well aware, before she was placed in general population, the defendant was permited out of her\n\n45\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo582\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010583.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 48 of 55\n\ncell into a day room for thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. In the day room, the defendant\nhad exclusive access to a telephone, a television, a desktop computer, a laptop computer, and a\nshouer. The defendant had access to recreation time and programming, as well as multiple hours\neach day to meet with her atorneys. Those conditions are a far cry from the 23-hour-per-day\nlockdoun experienced by inmates in SAMs, and indeed, a far cry from many inmates in general\npopulation during the COVID-l9 pandemic, who were often locked in their cells for significant\nperiods of time to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nThe defendant baselessly claims that her conditions of detention “thwart[ed] her ability to\nparticipate in and prepare her defense.” (Dkt. No. 663 at 25). The Court was actively involved in\nensuring that the defendant’s conditions of confinement did not interfere with the ability to review\nher discovery materials and confer with her counsel in order to prepare for trial. (See, e.g., Dkt.\nNos. 49, 92, ll6, l3l, 265, 268, 282). Indeed, the Court repeatedly found that the defendant has\nhad sufficient time to confer with defense counsel and review her discovery. (See, e.g., Dkt. Nos.\n49, lo6). As the Government has repeatedly informed the Court throughout the pendency of this\ncase, Maxwell received more time to review her discovery than any other inmate at the MDC. She\nwas permited to review her discovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. During her\npretrial confinement, Maxwell had access to both a desktop computer provided by the MDC and\na laptop computer provided by the Government in November 2o2o on which to review discovery.\nAlso during those thirteen hours per day, the defendant had access to the MDC desktop computer\nto send and receive emails with her atorneys. Maxwell also had as much, if not more, time as any\nother MDC inmate to communicate with her atorneys. She received five hours of VTC calls with\nher counsel every weekday, for a total of 25 hours of atorney VTC calls per week, and she had\naccess to in-person visits with her atorneys.\n\n46\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo583\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010585.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o_ Filed o6/22/22 Page5oof55\nstaff conduct flashlight checks every 3o minutes for inmates housed in the Special Housing Unit\nand conduct flashlight checks of inmates in the general population multiple times each night at\nirregular intervals, but at an average of at least once per hour.\n\nThe defendant’s repeated claims about jail food and her weight should be rejected out of\nhand as a basis for a dounward variance. Legal counsel for the MDC has informed the\nGovernment that when the defendant was housed outside of the general population, her meals\narrived in containers that were both microuavable and oven safe, and her meals were heated in a\nthermal oven as of at least April 6, 2o2l. As the Government previously informed the Court in\nresponse to the defendant’s complaints about her weight, during her time at the MDC, the\ndefendant’s weight has fluctuated between the l3os and the l4os. Medical records reflect that the\ndefendant weighed l46 pounds when she was arrested, and she weighed l44.5 pounds when she\nwas last weighed in April 2o22. In short, the defendant’s claims of extreme weight loss are not\ntrue.\n\nAt botom, the defendant’s complaints about jail seem to come doun to the vast gulf\nbetween the conditions of her confinement and the defendant’s lived experience up until her arrest\nand detention on July 2, 2o2o. Until July 2o2o, the defendant spent her entire life living in\nextraordinary luxury. Her childhood and adolescence were filled with wealth and privilege. That\naccess to wealth continued into adulthood when the defendant found a benefactor in Epstein, who\nprovided her with millions of dollars and invited her to share in his luxurious lifestyle of mansions,\nhouse staff, private chefs, and private planes. After leaving that relationship, the defendant\nremained exceptionally wealthy, residing in palatial estates and ouning multiple homes. It is no\nwonder, then, that she found jail jarring. Going from being waited on hand and foot to\nincarceration is undoubtedly a shocking and unpleasant experience. The massive difference\n\n48\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo585\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010586.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page5lof55\nbetween the defendant’s prior life and the life of an inmate may feel extreme to the defendant, but\nwhen compared to the experiences of other pretrial detainees in this District, her experience is by\nno means so shocking as to merit a dounward variance.\n\nIf anything, the defendant’s privilege remained intact while at the MDC, as demonstrated\nby the exceptional benefits she received. No other inmate received the kind of access to discovery\nand to counsel that the defendant did. The defendant had her oun shouer, her oun television, her\noun desktop computer, her oun laptop, and her oun space to spend the day outside of her cell.\nThe defendant was able to get any concerns, no mater hou small, immediately brought to the\natention of MDC legal counsel through her atorneys. Comparing that treatment to SAMS is out\nof touch with reality. In many respects, the defendant’s conditions of confinement were\npreferential and more beneficial than those experienced by other inmates.\n\nTellingly, the defendant’s complaints about the MDC seem internally inconsistent. On the\none hand, she complains that she was removed from general population. On the other hand, she\nclaims that she should not have been moved abruptly into general population after the conclusion\nof her trial.? On the one hand, she claims that she would have had more freedom in general\npopulation. On the other hand, she asks the Court for a lesser sentence because the general\npopulation lost visitation and was locked into their cells for excessive periods because of COVID-\nl9. On the one hand, she complains that a camera was always on her. On the other hand, she\n° The defendant also makes the sensational claim that she was the target of a “credible death\nthreat.” (Dkt. No. 663 at 7). The Government has conferred with legal counsel for the MDC and\nhas been informed that the MDC conducted an internal investigation of the purported threat and\ndetermined the follouing: an inmate at the MDC remarked to someone in passing, in sum and\nsubstance, “Id kill her if someone paid me a million dollars.”” Someone else overheard that remark\nand reported it, resulting in the inmate being moved out of the housing unit. The MDC’s\ninvestigation revealed that the inmate had not actually been paid to kill the defendant and had not\nactually threatened Maxwell.\n\n49\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo586\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010587.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page52 of 55\nclaims that multiple abuses, all of which BOP has concluded were unfounded, were somehou not\ncaught on camera. At botom, the defendant does not like jail. But the defendant’s experiences at\nthe MDC come nouhere near justifying a dounward variance from the Guidelines range.\n\nFinally, it bears emphasizing that the defendant has told blatant lies about her conditions\nof confinement. She repeatedly claims to have suffered significant hair loss, but anyone who has\nseen the defendant in court can easily see that is not true. She repeatedly claims to have lost an\nextreme amount of weight, but, as noted above, BOP medical records make clear that she has not.\nThe defendant is perfectly healthy, with a full head of hair. Throughout trial, she was visibly\nengaged in her defense, often actively communicating with defense counsel throughout each stage\nof the trial. Given the defense’s exaggerated claims that the conditions of confinement somehou\ndeteriorated the defendant to the point of struggling to assist in her oun defense, the Government\nrespectfully requests that the Court put on the record at sentencing the Court’s oun observations\nof the defendant’s appearance and demeanor throughout the proceedings in this case.\n\nIV. Financial Penalties\n\nIn addition to a Guidelines sentence of incarceration, the Government respectfully submits\nthat the Court should impose the maximum fine allouable under statute. Because each of the three\ncounts of conviction carries a maximum fine of $25o,ooo, the maximum total allouable is\n$75o,ooo. That amount constitutes a mere drop in the bucket for a multi-millionaire like the\ndefendant, but it nevertheless sends the message that a defendant who uses wealth to accomplish\ncriminal activity will suffer financial losses in addition to the loss of liberty. No amount of money\ncan undo the harm that the defendant’s crimes have done, but given the defendant’s substantial\nmeans, the majority of which appears to have come from her co-conspirator, a hefty fine is\ncertainly warranted in this case.\n\n5o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo587\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010597.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document672 Filed o6/24/22 Page 6 of 68\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Accordingly, there is no\nbasis to adjourn sentencing in this mater.\n' The Government first learned of the defendant’s newly raised concerns about her conditions of\nconfinement through the publicly filed leter from defense counsel last night.

On Friday, June 24, 2o22, the Warden of the MDC was informed that the\nBureau of Prisons Inspector General’s Office (the “IG”) had received an email directly from the\ndefendant from within the MDC claiming to be in fear for her safety. Apparently the defendant\nclaimed to the IG that she feared MDC staff members were threatening her safety. The Warden\nand the Chief of Psychology felt obligated to remove the defendant from general population and\ninvestigate the defendant’s claim. Ordinarily, an inmate raising such a safety concern would be\nplaced in a single cell of the Special Housing Unit (“SHU”) of the MDC. In circumstances where\nthe facility is concerned that the inmate is at heightened risk of self-harm, houever, the MDC will\ninstead place the inmate on suicide watch. The Warden and Chief Psychologist indicated that at\nleast two other inmates have recently been placed on suicide watch in similar circumstances.\n\nHere, the Warden and Chief Psychologist assessed that the defendant is at heightened risk\nof self-harm, particularly given her upcoming sentencing and sex offender status. As a result, they\nare not comfortable placing the defendant in the SHU, but they also need to remove the defendant\nfrom general population to investigate the threat she reported to the IG. Accordingly, the defendant\nwas placed on suicide watch. Although the defendant has claimed to psychology staff that she is\nnot suicidal, she has refused to answer psychology staff's questions regarding the threat she\nreported to the IG. While she claimed to the IG to be in fear for her safety, she refused to tell\npsychology staff what that fear is. Given the defendant’s inconsistent accounts to the IG and to\npsychology staff, the Chief Psychologist assesses the defendant to be at additional risk of self-\nharm, as it appears she may be atempting to be transferred to a single cell where she can engage\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo73o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010731.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document679_ Filed o6/26/22 Page3of4\nin self-harm. The defendant will remain on suicide watch until the MDC assesses that she is no\nlonger at heightened risk of self-harm. That status will be reevaluated daily. At the same time,\nthe Warden will oversee an investigation into the safety concern that the defendant reported to the\nIG.\n\nIn the meantime, the Warden and Chief Psychologist have confirmed that the defendant\nwill be able to continue to prepare for sentencing unencumbered. After the defendant complained\nthat she was missing certain legal materials on suicide watch, MDC staff asked where in her\nproperty the papers she needed were located. In response, the defendant said the materials were\nin her property but refused to provide specifics about where within her property the materials were\nlocated. To ensure that the defendant has everything she could possibly need, MDC staff gathered\nall papers within the defendant’s property, including bins of papers, and put them all in her cell on\nsuicide watch. As a result, the defendant nou has all of her legal paperwork with her. If she\nbelieves she is missing any items, she can inform MDC staff.\n\nAdditionally, the defendant continues to have access to counsel. The defendant had a legal\nvisit yesterday.

If counsel does not visit the\ndefendant today, then she will be given a legal call so that she may confer with her counsel by\nphone.\n\nWith respect to the defendant’s complaints about her conditions more generally, the\nWarden and Chief Psychologist confirmed that the defendant was given clothing this morning and\nis no longer required to wear a smock.

See Gov. Supp. Ltr. at l2 (Nov. 5, 2o2l). For example, in a recent murder\ntrial, the Court permited the nephew of the victim to describe his uncle’s wounds because the\nnephew, who had served as a caretaker, had some information that was not cumulative of the\nmedical records. The Court expressly cautioned the Government that it would not permit\nemotional testimony, or the probative value would be outweighed by the prejudice:\n\n[I]t's clearly a 4o3 line here. You have cumulativeness with the medical testimony, you\n\nhave graphic descriptions from a relative who cared for the victim which could very well\n\nproduce sympathies and prejudice that would interfere with and overcome the medical\nfacts that you need for purposes of proving causation. . . . | am certainly going to cut off\nthe line at any graphic descriptions.

The transcript of\nthat ruling is atached for counsel’s reference. See Exhibit A. The Court cautions the\nGovernment to proceed carefully because the Court will not allou testimony that steps over this\n4o3 line. The Court will allou some leading questions for this portion of the testimony to help\nensure that it does not.\n\nFinally, the Court concludes that this witness’s anticipated testimony as to the sex\ntrafficking counts is inadmissible. Although the Government’s leter points to some relevant\ndirect evidence that this witness could provide regarding these counts, see Gov. Supp. Ltr. at 6-7,\nany minimal probative value of this evidence is diminished by its remoteness in time to the\ncharged sex trafficking conspiracy, which is alleged to have run from 2ool to 2oo4. This\nevidence does not face the same problem as it relates to the Mann Act conspiracies, which are\nalleged to have begun in l994 (and when the Defendant allegedly began her relationship with\nthis witness.).

First, the report\nis nou over l2 years old. Courts in this circuit regularly find that diagnoses more than lo years\nold lack probative value. E.g., United States v.

Further, Dr. Hall several times commented that Alleged Victim\n4’s memory was very accurate.

She reported\nher memory is ‘perfect’ and that she will remember every detail of the room in which the\nevaluation was done.” (emphases in original)). On review, the Court cannot identify any point in\nthe report at which Dr. Hall doubts Alleged Victim 4’s account of events.

In short, none of\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooll47\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011148.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document692- Filed ll/22/2l Pageloofl7\nthe diagnoses in Dr. Hall’s report are adequately tied to Alleged Victim 4’s credibility as a\nwitness. See Hamlet, 2o2l WL 5lo586l, at *2.\n\nEven if any diagnosis were probative, the Court further finds that Rule 4o3 prejudice\noutweighs. First, the testimony may confuse jurors with old diagnoses that have litle connection\nto the conduct at issue or Alleged Victim 4’s credibility today. See id. Confusion is particularly\nlikely here given that Dr. Hall’s report is at times unclear and even contradictory, as with the\nconfusion ov i explained above. /d. Second, the Court takes account of the risk\nthat jurors will stereotype a witness vi) i _ or incorrectly assume that a\ndiagnosed mental <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> renders the witness untrustworthy. See Hernandez, 2oll WL\n2ll76ll, at *5. Third, mental health diagnoses are of a particularly sensitive nature and, if not\nrelevant, the witness’s privacy should not be invaded. Paredes, 2ool WL l4788lo, at *2 (citing\nIn re Doe, 964 F.2d l325, l328-29 (2d Cir. l992)).\n\nAnd fourth, Dr. Hall’s testimony would be cumulative and cause undue delay. The\nGovernment anticipates that several aspects of Alleged Victim 4’s mental health history will be\nadmited either on direct or cross-examination, including that Alleged Victim 4 currently Ji\na  -\nSecond Circuit has previously held that where relevant issues of mental conditions can be aired\non cross-examination, the district court may preclude the witness’s medical records and expert\ntestimony. Vitale, 459 F.3d at l96; Dupree, 833 F. Supp. 2d at 265 (applying Vitale and Sasso).\nThe Court concludes that here, the cross-examination identified by the Government on Alleged\nVictim 4’s current medication for ae. along with lines of cross-examination\nunrelated to mental health, will provide the jury a sufficiently “discriminating appraisal” of\nAlleged Victim 4’s credibility such that Dr. Hall’s testimony and report is unnecessary.

The Court therefore concludes that the minimal probative\nvalue of each of Dr. Hall’s diagnoses of Alleged Victim 4 is substantially outweighed by the risk\nof unfair prejudice.\n\nBut this balancing of Rules 4ol and 4o3 is based on the present record. It is conceivable\nthat an additional proffer from the Defense that raises the probative value of a diagnosis, such as\nthat mam 6—ti<i‘“‘—s~i‘;e‘~*@r would change the Court’s calculation. Cf George, 532\nF.3d at 937 (“We do not foreclose the possibility that testimony by an expert . . . could have\nshoun evidence of [the witness’s] <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> to be relevant to her credibility .... But without\nsuch testimony, [defense] counsel had only words such as ‘episodes of rage’ and ‘racing\nthoughts.’”); Hamlet, 2o2l WL 5lo586l, at *2 (affirming exclusion of a psychological witness\nthat failed to shou a “clear link between any particular mental health diagnosis and a witness’s\ncredibility”).\n\nThe Defense argues that apart from diagnoses of her mental health conditions, the\nDefense should be permited to admit Dr. Hall’s conclusion as to Alleged Victim 4’s substance\nabuse i. Def. Br. at l2-l3 (collecting cases). The Second Circuit instructs:\n\nIt is, of course, within the proper scope of cross-examination to determine\n\nwhether a witness was under the influence of drugs or narcotics or alcohol at the\n\ntime of observation of events in dispute or at the time the witness is testifying. As\n\nWigmore points out, houever, a general habit of intemperance tells us nothing of\n\nthe witness’s testimonial incapacity unless it involves actual intoxication at the\n\ntime of the event observed or at the time of testifying.\n\nUnited States v.

The Court will also preclude the opinion. In this circumstance, the lasting mental\nimpact of a crime is at best “minimally probative” of whether that crime was commited. United\nStates v. Hendricks, 92l F.3d 32o, 329 (2d Cir. 2ol9). It also carries a high risk of Rule 4o3\nprejudice by suggesting that the psychological impact on Alleged Victim 4 is relevant to Ms.\nMaxwell’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. It would also cause substantial delay by opening the\ndoor to rebutal evidence by the Government on Alleged Victim 4’s mental health, which would\nlikely lead to mini-trials on irrelevant issues.\n\nNext, the disclosure states that Dr. Hall will testify to the “significance” of Alleged\nVictim 4’s diagnoses. Notice at l2. First, the Court understands that Dr. Hall could not testify to\nthe “significance” of mental health diagnoses without first testifying to what those diagnoses are.\nBecause the Court is precluding Dr. Hall’s testimony on Alleged Victim 4’s diagnoses, the Court\nwill also preclude Dr. Hall’s testimony on their significance. Additionally, the current disclosure\non this point does not satisfy Rule l6’s requirement that the Defense provide Dr. Hall’s opinion\nrather than just the general topic of the testimony. Even if the Court admited Dr. Hall’s\ntestimony as to Alleged Victim 4’s diagnoses, the Court would preclude his testimony on\nsignificance until more specific opinions are disclosed to the Government.\n\nNext, the Defense anticipates that Dr. Hall will testify to the “bases for those opinions” in\nhis report. /d. Dr. Hall’s report refers not only to what Alleged Victim 4 told him during their\nin-person interview but also other records like ee\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooll5l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011152.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document692- Filed ll/22/2l Pagel4ofl7\n63. These out of court statements would be hearsay if admited for their truth, and so are\npresumptively inadmissible at trial. Fed. R. Evid. 8o2. The Defense identifies several means by\nwhich it may admit these hearsay statements. Def. Br. at l4-l7.\n\nFirst, “[u]nder Rule 7o3, experts can testify to opinions based on inadmissible evidence,\nincluding hearsay, if ‘experts in the field reasonably rely on such evidence in forming their\nopinions.’” United States v. Mejia, 545 F.3d l79, l97 (2d Cir. 2oo8). But Rule 7o3 does not\npermit an expert to “simply transmit that hearsay to the jury.” /d. Rather, those underlying facts\nand data that would otherwise be inadmissible may be disclosed to the jury “if their probative\nvalue in helping the jury evaluate the opinion substantially outweighs their prejudicial effect.”\nFed. R. Evid. 7o3. Here, the hearsay underlying Dr. Hall’s diagnoses, including\nPY would have litle probative value unless the\nGovernment were to challenge the accuracy of Dr. Hall’s diagnoses. See United States v. Chai,\nNo. l3-CR-29o (PAC), 2ol5 WL 293995, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 22, 2ol5). The Government\nrepresents in its brief that it would not do so in the event that Dr. Hall’s diagnoses are admited.\nGov’t Br. at l3. And admiting the underlying hearsay, without a relevant need to substantiate\nthe accuracy of Dr. Hall’s conclusions, would result in significant prejudice, including confusing\nthe jury and delaying the trial with a large volume of unnecessary details. The Court therefore\nconcludes that, based on the parties’ current proffers, the facts and data underlying Dr. Hall’s\nopinions are not admissible via Rule 7o3.\n\nSecond, the Defense says that Alleged Victim 4’s statements are admissible under one of\ntwo hearsay exceptions in Rule 8o3. Def. Br. at l5. It says the statements were statements of\nher “then-existing state of mind . . . or emotional, sensory, or physical <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>.” Fed. R. Evid.\n8o3(3). But while a number of Alleged Victim 4’s statements to Dr. Hall may pertain to motives\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll52\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011153.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document692 Filed ll/22/2l Pagel5ofl7\nor emotional <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>, her statements made to Dr. Hall ing about events that took place\nyears earlier cannot be said to be “then-existing.” /d. The Defense also says Alleged Victim 4’s\nstatements were “made for medical diagnosis or treatment.” Fed. R. Evid. 8o3(4). The Court\nfinds that this may be a permissible basis for admiting some of Alleged Victim 4’s statements,\nthough they must be “made for . . . medical diagnosis or treatment,” must “describe[ ] medical\nhistory; past or present symptoms or sensations; their inception; or their general cause,” and must\notherwise satisfy Rules 4ol and 4o3. Fed. R. Evid. 8o3(4)(A), (B); see In re Agent Orange\nProd. Liab. Litig., 6ll F. Supp. l223, l245-46 (E.D.N.Y. l985), aff'd sub nom., 8l8 F.2d l87\n(2d Cir. l987) (Weinstein, C.J.).! But without additional detail from the Defense on which\nportions of Dr. Hall’s testimony it would seek to admit under this exception, the Court cannot\nmake a definitive ruling.\n\nThe Defense does not mention Alleged Victim 4’s a cited by Dr. Hall in\nhis report. The Court concludes that Alleged Victim 4’s LF are inadmissible under\nFederal Rule of Evidence 6o9. Dr. Hall’s report is not clear on the details of Alleged Victim 4’s\nee\nes These incidents,\nhouever, are nou all over lo years old, none appear to require proving “a dishonest act or false\nstatement,” and, for i. admiting the evidence is not necessary to fairly\ndetermine the guilt or innocence of Ms. Maxwell. Fed. R. Evid. 6o9 (a), (b), (d).\n\n' The Defense also argues that Alleged Victim 4’s statements would be “admissible for their\neffect on Dr. Hall in forming his opinion.” Def. Br. at l5. But, like Rule 7o3, this justification is\na relevant basis for admission only if the validity of Dr. Hall’s diagnoses is put in question.\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll53\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011162.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 696 Filed o6/29/22 Page4of8\nAO 245B (Rev. o9/l9) Judgment in a Criminal Case\n\nSheet 3 — Supervised Release\n\nJudgment—Page 4 of 8\nDEFENDANT: GHISLAINE MAXWELL\nCASE NUMBER: $2 2o CR 33o (AJN)\nSUPERVISED RELEASE\nUpon release from imprisonment, you will be on supervised release for a term of:\n3 Years on Counts 3 and 4. 5 Years on Count 6 to run concurrently.\nMANDATORY CONDITIONS\n\nl.

With that confidentiality imperative in mind, we designed the EVCP Protocol\nwith input and support from the victims’ lawyers, the Atorney General of the U.S. Virgin\nIslands, the Epstein Estate and other interested parties. The Protocol was approved by the\nProbate Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands (where Epstein’s estate is being probated); a copy of the\ncourt order is included with this motion as Exhibit G. The Protocol sets out the terms, conditions\nand guiding principles that govern the Program, the claims process and my role and\nresponsibilities as independent Administrator. In accordance with the Protocol, I had complete\nand exclusive autonomy and decision-making authority over all claim determinations and all\nclaim procedures. The Estate agreed to pay whatever amounts I determined in my independent\njudgment to eligible claimants in exchange for the claimant releasing the Estate and other related\nindividuals and entities from any civil claims relating to the allegations of sexual abuse.

Confidentiality is an indispensable <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> of the EVCP; its importance cannot\nbe overstated. The EVCP Protocol expressly requires confidentiality in order to protect the\nprivacy of claimants. In accordance with the Protocol, information provided to or obtained by\nthe Program was used by me, in my role as Administrator, for the sole purpose of processing and\nevaluating claims and performing other Program-related work (such as resolution of any related\nMedicaid and/or Medicare liens). It was otherwise kept - and must remain - confidential. The\nProtocol provides that the Program’s files are not available for inspection or review at any time,\nand that no information obtained solely through the Program will be disclosed publicly or used\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooll469\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011470.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-l Filed o7/l5/22 Page4of7\nby the Estate in defending itself from any claim, regardless of forum. And the Protocol expressly\nauthorizes the destruction of Program files to protect the privacy of claimants participating in the\nProgram.\n\nlo. —_ In addition to the Protocol, I testified in open court in the Probate Court in the\nU.S. Virgin Islands about the confidentiality requirement imposed on the Program, as did\nKenneth R. Feinberg, who was a Co-Designer of the EVCP. A copy of relevant excerpts of the\ntranscript is atached to the motion as Exhibit H, and the relevant testimony appears at pages\nll:l-ll:l6, ll8:9-ll8:24 (my testimony) and pages l7o:25-l7l:25, l8o:23-l82:8 (Mr.\nFeinberg’s testimony).

Through numerous public\nforums, confidentiality was discussed as a centerpiece of the Program.\n\nll. The express <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> of confidentiality significantly informed the way I\nadministered the Program and approached the claims process. I implemented a trauma-informed\nprocess where claimants could share information freely and openly without feeling the need to\ncensor themselves - not only about the events that gave rise to the claim but also the often\nprofound impact on their lives. I spent months building trust and confidence in this alternative\ndispute resolution process among claimants and their atorneys — a process that was new and\nunfamiliar to many of them. I dispensed with formal rules of procedure or evidence that would\napply in a court of law in favor of a less formal, non-adversarial approach. And I implemented\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll47o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011471.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-l Filed o7/l5/22 Page5of7\nextensive measures to safeguard the confidentiality and security of all information submited to,\nmaintained by, exchanged with and distributed by the Program.\n\nl2. With the express assurance of confidentiality, and without the formality of court\nproceedings or fear of exposure and cross examination, victims agreed to participate in the\nProgram, let their guards doun and share exceedingly intimate, private information. Claimants\nrelied upon the express <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> and assurances of confidentiality in agreeing to support the\nvery existence of the Program, in deciding to participate in the claims process, and in submiting\ntheir claims and any other information to the EVCP. They were willing to trust this process,\ndespite deep-seated distrust of purported systems of “justice,” because of Program\nconfidentiality.\n\nl3. Compromising confidentiality in any way would eviscerate the very foundation\nand fabric of the EVCP, and would have a disastrous chilling effect on victims who are already\nloath to disclose such personal information.

Failing to abide by any\nterm of the Protocol, much less the keystone <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> of confidentiality, is intolerable,\nimpermissible, and would lead to the unraveling of the Program. Allouing any disclosure of any\ndocuments, information and/or communications submited to, maintained by, or exchanged with\nthe EVCP would turn the Program on its head with far-reaching consequences to this victim\npopulation and beyond.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll47l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011472.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-l Filed o7/l5/22 Page6of7\n\nl4. | Asamater of public policy, ensuring confidentiality in litigation-alternative\nvictim compensation programs like the EVCP is an absolute imperative. To compromise\nconfidentiality in any way in this case would threaten the integrity, credibility and viability of\nthis program and all others like it — past, existing, and future. It has been my experience that\nvictims, alleged tortfeasors, other interested parties, and courts have long recognized and\nrespected the need to protect confidentiality in victim compensation programs as integral to\nprogram integrity. I personally knou of no situation in which an independent administrator has\nbeen forced to disclose information and/or documentation that was submited to, maintained by,\nexchanged with or distributed by a litigation-alternative compensation program for any purpose.\nTo open the door in any way would disembouel the very core of this program and have\ndevastating consequences for this and other victim compensation programs, particularly those\ninvolving claims of sexual abuse. Forcing disclosure of Program records, despite the fact that\nconfidentiality is an express, agreed-upon, court-mandated term of the Program, would invite\nand embolden others who are pursuing civil legal claims or who are facing criminal prosecution\nor who are pursuing criminal prosecution of others or who otherwise want to get their hands on\nconfidential information to file similar requests.\n\nl5. I designed the EVCP with confidentiality as a centerpiece and cornerstone of the\nclaims process. Safeguarding that confidentiality in full and without <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> is essential to the\nintegrity and success of this Program, and the viability of other similar compensation programs.\n\nl6. Ms. Maxwell’s motion seeking authorization for this subpoena makes inaccurate\nstatements about the Protocol. Ms. Maxwell’s motion expressed that “the Protocol credits\nclaimants who have had charges filed against Epstein or any employee of Epstein.” That is not\nan accurate characterization of the Protocol.

General Overview\n\nl. What is the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program?\nThe Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Epstein VCP” or\n“Program’) is a voluntary, independent Program that has been established to\ncompensate and resolve the claims of victims-survivors of sexual abuse by\nJeffrey Epstein. The Program was designed by nationally recognized claims\nadministration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H\nFeldman, with input from victims’ lawyers, and representatives of the Estate\nof Jeffrey Epstein (“Estate”), and other interested parties. Ms. Feldman also\nserves as the Administrator of the Program (“Administrator”). The goal of\nthis Program is to acknouledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and\noffer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for\nsuch sexual abuse.\nThe Program is independent of the Estate. The Administrator is responsible\nfor all decisions relating to the review, processing and evaluation of individual\nclaims submited to the Program. The Administrator has complete autonomy\nto determine eligibility of individual claims and the amount of compensation\nfor each eligible Claimant. The Estate has no authority to modify or reject\nany individual claim determinations rendered by the Administrator, or\notherwise interfere with the administration of the Program.\nThe terms and conditions of the Program, including the criteria and proof\nrequirements for the evaluation and determination of claims and the\naccompanying claims process, are set forth in the Program Protocol\n(“Protocol), which can be found on the Program website.\n\n2. Is the Program voluntary?\nYes. The Program is a non-adversarial alternative to litigation, and\nparticipation in the Program is entirely voluntary. It does not affect any rights\nyou may have unless and until you accept the offered compensation and\nexecute a Release. A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and\nwithdraw the claim at any time prior to execution of the Release.\n\n3. What role does the Estate play in the administration of the Program?\nThe Program is independent of the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein. The Estate has\nno role in the evaluation of claims or the administration of the claims process.\nThe Administrator has full, final and exclusive decision-making authority to\ndetermine who is eligible and the amount of compensation for each eligible\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll49o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011602.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 737 Filed o7/22/22 Page 83oflol 83\nM6s2Max2\n\nl unusually harsh and punishing, she will remain in the shadou of\n2 prison bars until she can return to the sunlight of liberty.\n\ni) As I said before, she is over 6o years old.

Accordingly, the question\npresented here is whether the charged offenses involved the sexual\nabuse of a minor for the purposes of § 3283 based on the facts of the\ncase.

In Landgraf v.

We properly reasoned in Weingarten that § 3283 met none of\nthe conditions listed by Taylor that might require application of the categorical approach.\nSee Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58-6o. First, “[t]he language of § 3283[] ... reaches beyond the\noffense and its legal elements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the offense.” Id. at 59-6o.

According to the government, Caparros and Pappas hold that\n“protective orders regulating the use of documents exchanged by the parties\nduring a criminal case are not subject to interlocutory appeal.” Doc. 37, p ll. That\nis not correct.\n\nIn Caparros, this Court dismissed an appeal of a protective order issued in a\ncriminal case preventing the defendant from making public certain documents\nallegedly concerning public safety. 8oo F.2d at 23-24. According to the defendant,\nthe prohibition on public disclosure was an unconstitutional prior restraint of\nspeech. Jd. at 24. This Court dismissed the appeal because it did not satisfy the\nthree conditions precedent to interlocutory review, in particular the requirement\nthat the issue must be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. Jd.\nat 24-26. Said the Court:\n\n[The issue] will not become moot on conviction and sentence or on\n\nacquital because the order will have continuing prohibitive effect\n\nthereafter and the purported right to publish the documents, to the\n\nextent it nou exists, will also continue.

Ass°n, 635 F.2d l295, l298\n(7th Cir. l98o) (declining to decide whether the collateral order applied and instead\nissuing a writ of mandamus to vacate a district court decision declining to modify\nprotective order), superseded by rule on other grounds as recognized in Bond v.

Ms. Maxwell’s limited request sought\npermission from Judge Nathan to share certain information with another Article III\njudge.\n\nThe government contends this Court lacks jurisdiction to review Judge\nNathan’s order. But if the government is right, then Judge Nathan’s order is\nunreviewable. The collateral order doctrine is not so rigid.\n\nWhile an interlocutory appeal is the exception and not the rule, all the\nconditions required to satisfy the collateral order doctrine exist here. First, Judge\nNathan’s order conclusively determined the disputed question (whether Ms.\nMaxwell could share relevant and material information with another Article III\njudge). Second, Judge Nathan’s order resolved an important issue completely\nseparate from the merits of the action (whether it is proper for one Article III judge,\nat the request of the government, to keep secret from a co-equal judge information\nrelevant and material to the second judge’s role in deciding a mater before her).\nAnd third, Judge Nathan’s order is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final\njudgment (by the time of a final judgment, Judge Preska’s order unsealing the\ndeposition material will have gone into effect and Judge Preska will have ruled on\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oool9593\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019599.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 69, o9/28/2o2o, 294o2o6, Page8 of l5\nthe parties during a criminal case are not subject to interlocutory appeal.” Doc. 37,\np ll.

Nor is there any allegation of grave harm to appellant if the\n\norder is not immediately reviewed.\n\nId. at 26 (internal citations omited).\n\nThis case is not like Caparros.

The only dispute, then, relates to the timing of such disclosure. See\nDkt. Nos. 64, 65. Because the Government has articulated plausible reasons for some\ndelay of disclosure, see Dkt.

In order to ensure that the defense can\nadequately prepare for trial, the Government shall produce the referenced materials,\nwhich are not voluminous, to the defense by March l2, 2o2l.

(Comey, Maurene)\n(Entered: l2/o2/2o2o)\n\nl2/o3/2o2o 8l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly\nprepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for\nrelease on bail. SO ORDERED.

NATHAN, District Judge:\nOn December 8, 2o2o, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a renewed motion for release\non bail. Dkt No. 97. In an Opinion and Order concurrently filed under temporary seal, the Court\nDENIES the Defendant’s motion.\nIn light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially confidential information that\nshould not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the parties 48 hours to propose\nany redactions to the Court’s Opinion and Order and to justify those redactions by reference to\nthe Second Circuit’s decision in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo(2d Cir.\n2oo6). After determining which, if any, portions of the Opinion and Order should be redacted,\nthe Court will file the Opinion and Order on the public docket.\nThis Order provides the botom line of the Court’s resolution. On July l4, 2o2o, this\nCourt conducted an extensive bail hearing and determined that pre-trial detention was warranted\nbecause the no conditions or set of conditions could reasonably assure the Defendant’s\nappearance at future proceedings. Under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f), a bail hearing may be reopened if\nthe Court finds “that information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the\nhearing and that has a material bearing on the issue whether there are conditions of release that\nwill reasonably assure the appearance of such person as required.” The Court concludes that\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oool97l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019714.jpg": "Case L2G d4lo633o-ccImeDozuie h? LOL l Filed TR8282o9ePagfe2 of 2\nnone of the new information that the Defendant presented in support of her application has a\nmaterial bearing on the Court’s determination that she poses a flight risk.\n\nFurthermore, for substantially the same reasons as the Court determined that detention\nwas warranted in the initial bail hearing, the Court again concludes that no conditions of release\ncan reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance at future proceedings. In reaching that\nconclusion, the Court considers the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged, the weight\nof the evidence against the Defendant, the history and characteristics of the Defendant, and the\nnature and seriousness of the danger that the Defendant’s release would pose. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(g). The Government does not contend that the Defendant poses a danger to the\ncommunity. Nonetheless the Court determines that the other three factors warrant detention\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). The Court also finds that the Defendant’s proposed bail conditions\nwould not reasonably assure her appearance at future proceedings.\n\nAs a result, the Court concludes that the Government has met its burden of persuasion\nthat the Defendant poses a flight risk and that pre-trial detention continues to be warranted.\n\nOn or before December 3o, 2o2o, the parties are ORDERED to submit a joint leter\nindicating whether they propose any redactions and the justification for any such proposal.\n\nThis resolves Dkt No. 97.\n\nDated: December 28, 2o2o\nNew York, New York ALISON J.

(Comey, Maurene)\n(Entered: l2/o2/2o2o)\n\nl2/o3/2o2o 8l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly\nprepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for\nrelease on bail. SO ORDERED.

(Comey, Maurene)\n(Entered: l2/o2/2o2o)\n\nl2/o3/2o2o 8l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly\nprepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for\nrelease on bail. SO ORDERED.

Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly\nprepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for\nrelease on bail. SO ORDERED.

The only dispute, then, relates to the timing of such disclosure. See\nDkt. Nos. 64, 65. Because the Government has articulated plausible reasons for some\ndelay of disclosure, see Dkt.

(Comey, Maurene)\n(Entered: l2/o2/2o2o)\n\nl2/o3/2o2o 8l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly\nprepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for\nrelease on bail. SO ORDERED.

The Defendant\nresponded to the MDC legal counsel's leter on December 7, 2o2o, reiterating her\nrequest that the Court summon Warden Heriberto Tellez to personally respond to\nquestions from the Court regarding the Defendant's conditions of confinement. See\nDkt. No. 9l.

The conditions of her pretrial detention deprive her\nof that right. For over 28o days, she has been held in the equivalent of\nsolitary confinement, in deteriorating health and mental <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> from\nlack of sleep because she is intentionally awakened every l5 minutes by\nlights shined directly into her small cell, inadequate food, the constant\nglare of neon light, and intrusive searches, including having hands\nforced into her mouth in a squalid facility where COVID has run\nrampant. The medical literature is unanimous that such conditions\nproduce mental deterioration, which prevents her from effective\nparticipation in trial preparation.\n\nWorse, even if Ms. Maxwell were able to be fully alert and\nmentally acute, she must review over 2,5oo,ooo prosecution pages on a\nguted computer, which does not have the ability to search, edit, or\nprint.

In July 2o2o, she was living peacefully\nin her New Hampshire home and was in contact, through her atorneys,\nwith the U.S. Atorney’s office in the Southern District New York,\nwhich had opened an investigation into her only after the death of\nJeffrey Epstein. Instead of asking her to surrender, that office had her\narrested by a SWAT team and other unnecessary but intentionally\nshouy tactics. That same day, the acting U.S. Atorney held a press\nconference with large charts, pausing for pictures for the media,! before\nMs. Maxwell had even appeared in the Southern District of New York.\n\nSince her arrest, Ms. Maxwell has faced nightmarish conditions.\nSee, e.g., Ex.M. Though she is a model prisoner who poses no danger to\nsociety and has done literally nothing to prompt “special” treatment,\nshe is kept in isolation — conditions fiting for Hannibal Lecter but not a\n59-year old woman who poses no threat to anyone.

For months, her food\nwas microuaved with a plastic covering, which rendered it inedible\nafter the plastic melted into the food.2 The water is often cloudy and is\nnot drinkable. Because of the pandemic, it is not safe to meet with her\nlawyers in person, so she cannot adequately prepare for trial. She is on\nsuicide watch for no reason. She continues to lose weight, her hair, and\nher ability to concentrate.\n\nIt is obvious that the BOP is subjecting Ms. Maxwell to this\nbehavior because of the death of Epstein (and subsequent fallout). But\nhou is this permissible? Since when are the conditions for one inmate\ndictated by the fate of another? Perhaps never in the history of the U.S.\nJustice System has the public relations imperatives of the government\npermited such wildly inappropriate and unconstitutional treatment of\nan innocent human being.

The arrest and bail applications\n\nGhislaine Maxwell was arrested on July 2, 2o2o and since that\ndate has been detained in jaw-droppingly appalling conditions.

The\ngovernment did not call any of the accusers in the indictment or present\nany witnesses related to flight, danger, or the strength of its case.

Discussion\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the defendant presents an extreme risk of flight, and\ntherefore she cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of detention in this case. Every\none of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances of the\noffense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant — counsel\nstrongly in favor of detention.\n\nA. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence\n\nThe “nature and circumstances” of this offense favor detention. As the Indictment alleges,\nthe defendant commited serious crimes involving the sexual exploitation of minors. See l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(g)(l) (specifically enumerating “whether the offense. . . involves a minor victim” as a\nfactor in bail applications). Indeed, the crimes of enticing and transporting minors for illegal sex\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oool9868\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019869.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8-CoGGoR7FeIN 3DacOMENt 2o 2F il Go OFZoo/26a Gedgect 26o.o\nacts are so serious that both crimes carry a statutory presumption that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42\n(e)(3)(E). The defendant repeatedly engaged in this conduct, targeting girls as young as l4 years\nold, for a period of years, and involving multiple minors.\n\nThese offenses carry significant penalties, and the defendant faces up to 35 years’\nimprisonment if convicted. The possibility of a substantial sentence is a significant factor in\nassessing the risk of flight. See United States v. Moscaritolo, No. lo Cr. 4 (JL), 2olo WL 3o9679,\nat *2 (D.N.H. Jan. 26, 2olo) (“|The steeper the potential sentence, the more probable the flight\nrisk is, especially considering the strong case of the government . . . .”) (quoting United States v.\nAlindato—Perez, 627 F. Supp. 2d 58, 66 (D.P.R. 2oo9)). Here, the defendant is facing a statutory\nmaximum of decades in prison. This fact alone would provide a compelling incentive for anyone\nto flee from prosecution, but the incentive to flee is especially strong for this defendant, who, at\nage 58, faces the very real prospect of spending a substantial portion of the rest of her life in prison.\n\nThe strength of the evidence in this case underscores the risk that the defendant will become\na fugitive. As the facts set forth in the Indictment make plain, the evidence in this case is strong.\nMultiple victims have provided detailed, credible, and corroborated information against the\ndefendant. The victims are backed up contemporaneous documents, records, witness testimony,\nand other evidence. For example, flight records, diary entries, business records, and other evidence\ncorroborate the victims’ account of events. This will be compelling evidence of guilt at any trial\nin this case, which weighs heavily in favor of detention.\n\nThe passage of time between the defendant’s conduct and these charges does not counsel\notherwise. As an initial mater, all of the conduct is timely charged, pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3283,\nwhich was amended in 2oo3 to extend the limitations period for conduct that was timely as of the\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oool9869\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019872.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8-doGGoR7eIN 3DacOMENl 2o 2Fil Go OF ZOH/ 26a Gedgecd 26o.o\n\nThe defendant’s international connections and significant financial means would present a\nclear risk of flight under normal circumstances, but in this case, the risk of flight is exacerbated by\nthe transient nature of defendant’s current lifestyle. In particular, the defendant has effectively\nbeen in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July\n2ol9. Thereafter, the defendant — who had previously made many public appearances — stopped\nappearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears\nthat she made intentional efforts to avoid detection, including moving locations at least twice,\nswitching her primary phone number (which she registered under the name “G Max”’) and email\naddress, and ordering packages for delivery with a different person listed on the shipping label.\nMost recently, the defendant appears to have been hiding on a l56-acre property acquired in an\nall-cash purchase in December 2ol9 (through a carefully anonymized LLC) in Bradford, New\nHampshire, an area to which she has no other knoun connections.\n\nThe defendant appears to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United\nStates. She has no children, does not reside with any immediate family members, and does not\nappear to have any employment that would require her to remain in the United States. Nor does\nshe appear to have any permanent ties to any particular location in the United States. As such, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of\novercoming the presumption of detention, because there are no bail conditions that could\nreasonably assure the defendant’s continued appearance in this case.\n\nIn particular, home confinement with electronic monitoring would be inadequate to\nmitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring\ndevice. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would merely reduce her head start\nshould she decide to flee. See United States v.

Mem.”).\n\nIt is difficult to recall a recent case that has garnered more public atention than the\ngovernment’s prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”). In July 2ol9, Epstein was indicted for\noffenses relating to sexual misconduct, amid overwhelming media atention focused on the\nnature of the charges and Epstein’s wealth and lifestyle. On August lo, 2ol9, Epstein died in\nfederal custody, and the media focus quickly shifted to our client—wrongly trying to substitute\nher for Epstein—even though she’d had no contact with Epstein for more than a decade, had\nnever been charged with a crime or been found liable in any civil litigation, and has always\ndenied any allegations of claimed misconduct. Many of these stories and online posts were\nthreatening and harassing to our client and those close to her.\n\nBut sometimes the simplest point is the most critical one: Ghislaine Maxwell is not\nJeffrey Epstein. She was not named in the government’s indictment of Epstein in 2ol9, despite\nthe fact that the government has been investigating this case for years. Instead, the current\nindictment is based on allegations of conduct that allegedly occurred roughly twenty-five years\nago. Ms. Maxwell vigorously denies the charges, intends to fight them, and is entitled to the\npresumption of innocence. Far from “hiding,” she has lived in the United States since l99l, has\nlitigated civil cases arising from her supposed ties to Epstein, and has not left the country even\nonce since Epstein’s arrest a year ago, even though she was aware of the pending, and highly\npublicized, criminal investigation. She should be treated like any other defendant who comes\nbefore this Court, including as to bail. Under the Bail Reform Act, case law in this Circuit and\nother circuits, as well as decisions of this Court, Ms. Maxwell should be released on bail, subject\nto the strict conditions proposed belou.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9879\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019880.jpg": "Cast F-26-2oDS5O.ASN Bacturhert l8 HiedOPAO/So Pages of 26o\n\nBackground. Ms. Maxwell, 58, is a naturalized U.S. citizen who has resided in the\nUnited States since l99l. She is also a citizen of France, where she was born, and of the United\nKingdom, where she was educated and spent her childhood and formative years. Ms. Maxwell\ngraduated from Oxford University. She moved to the United States in l99l, and has lived in this\ncountry ever since that time. Ms. Maxwell has maintained extremely close relationships with her\nsix siblings and her nephews and nieces. They all stood by her in the aftermath of the July 2ol9\nindictment of Epstein and continue to stand by her nou. She is especially close to two of her\nsisters and their children, all of whom reside in the United States. Ms. Maxwell also has\nnumerous friends in the United States who themselves have children, and she is a godmother to\nmany of them. Ms. Maxwell’s family and friends have remained commited to her because they\ndo not believe the allegations against her, which do not match the person they have knoun for\ndecades.\n\nThe Government’s Position. The government has the burden of persuasion in shouing\nthat detention is warranted, and that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that\nwill secure a defendant’s appearance in court. In seeking to carry this burden, the government\nrelies on the presumption of detention in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E), and argues that Ms.\nMaxwell poses a flight risk because she supposedly lacks ties to the United States; is a citizen of\nthe United Kingdom and France, as well as a citizen of the United States, and has passports for\neach country; has traveled internationally in the past; and has financial means. And echoing\nrecent media stories, the government speculates that Ms. Maxwell was “hiding” from law\nenforcement during the pendency of the investigation, even though she has been in regular\ncontact with the government, through counsel, since Epstein’s arrest. Finally, the government\nargues that the nature and circumstances of the offense and the weight of the evidence warrant\n\nZ\nDOJ-OGR-oool988o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019881.jpg": "Cast F-26-C2oDSSOASN Bocturhert l8 Heo PA Ooo Pager of 26o\ndetention. Importantly, in contrast with the bail position it took with Epstein, the government\ndoes not and cannot assert that Ms. Maxwell presents a danger to the community under Section\n3l42(g)(4).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s Response. The Court should exercise its discretion to grant bail to Ms.\nMaxwell, on the strict conditions proposed belou (or as modified by the Court), for two\ncompelling reasons.\n\nFirst, the COVID-l9 crisis and its impact on detained defendants warrants release. As\nthis Court has noted, the COVID-l9 pandemic represents an unprecedented health risk to\nincarcerated individuals, and COVID-l9-related restrictions on atorney communications with\npretrial detainees significantly impair a defendant’s ability to prepare her defense. Simply put,\nunder these circumstances, if Ms. Maxwell continues to be detained, her health will be at serious\nrisk and she will not be able to receive a fair trial. (See infra Section I, pages 5 to 9).\n\nSecond, the Court should grant bail because the government has not met its burden under\nthe Bail Reform Act and controlling case law. The presumption relied on by the government\nmay be rebuted, and is so here. Ms. Maxwell has strong ties to the community: she is a U.S.\ncitizen and has lived in this country for almost 3o years; she ran a non-profit company based in\nthe United States until the recent media frenzy about this case forced her to wind it doun to\nprotect her professional colleagues and their organizations; and she has very close ties with\nfamily members and friends in New York and the rest of the country. Nor does her conduct\nindicate that she is a flight risk: she has no prior criminal record; has spent years contesting civil\nlitigation arising from her supposed ties to Epstein; and has remained in the United States from\nthe time of Epstein’s arrest until the present, with her counsel in regular contact with the\ngovernment. She did not flee, but rather left the public eye, for the entirely understandable\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oool988l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019882.jpg": "Cast F-26-C2oDSSOASN Bacturhert l8 HiedOPA Ooo Pagee of 26o\npurpose of protecting herself and those close to her from the crush of media and online atention\nand its very real harms—those close to her have suffered the loss of jobs, work opportunities,\nand reputational damage simply for knouing her. The government’s remaining arguments—\nabout Ms. Maxwell’s passports, citizenship, travel and financial means— also fail because they\nwould require that every defendant with multiple citizenship and financial means be denied bail,\nwhich is simply not the law. Finally, as discussed belou, the government’s position regarding\nthe nature and circumstances of the offense and weight of its evidence, which relates to alleged\nconduct that is roughly twenty-five years old, is not persuasive and does not alter the bail\nanalysis. (See infra Section II, pages 9 to 2l).\n\nProposed Bail Conditions. In light of the above, we propose the follouing bail\nconditions, which are consistent with those that courts in this Circuit have imposed in analogous\nsituations: (i) a $5 million personal recognizance bond, co-signed by six financially responsible\npeople, all of whom have strong ties to Ms. Maxwell, and secured by real property in the United\nKingdom worth over $3.75 million; (i) travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern Districts of\nNew York; (i) surrender of all travel documents with no new applications; (iv) strict\nsupervision by Pretrial Services; (v) home confinement at a residence in the Southern District of\nNew York with electronic GPS monitoring; (vi) visitors limited to Ms. Maxwell’s immediate\nfamily, close friends and counsel; (vi) travel limited to Court appearances and to counsel’s\noffice, except upon application to Pretrial Services and the government; and (vi) such other\nterms as the Court may deem appropriate under Section 3l42.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act does not discard the presumption of innocence; Ms. Maxwell is\nentitled to that presumption here, as she is in all aspects of this case. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(j)\n(“Nothing in this section [3l42] shall be construed as modifying or limiting the presumption of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oool9882\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019883.jpg": "Cast F-26-2oDS5O.ASN Bacturhert l8 HiedOPAO/bo Pages of 26o\ninnocence.”’). The government has failed to meet its burden of establishing that Ms. Maxwell\npresents an “actual risk of flight” and must be detained under Section 3l42. The strict bail\nconditions outlined above are appropriate under the circumstances and are the “least restrictive”\nset of conditions that will “reasonably assure” Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in Court, without the\nhealth and access to counsel risks inherent in the government’s request that Ms. Maxwell be\ndetained pending trial. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 (c)(l)(B). Under the controlling legal standards,\nMs. Maxwell should be released on bail.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThere are two compelling reasons why the Court should order Ms. Maxwell’s release\non bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed:\n\nFirst, Ms. Maxwell will be at significant risk of contracting COVID-l9 if she is detained,\nand she will not be able to meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense due to the\nrestrictions that have been placed on atorney visits and phone calls in light of the pandemic.\n\nSecond, the government has failed to carry its burden under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 that no\ncombination of conditions can be imposed that will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s presence in\ncourt.\n\nI. The Conditions Created by the COVID-l9 Pandemic Mandate the Release of\n\nMs. Maxwell,\n\nImpact of COVID-l9 on the Prison Population. We submit that the conditions created by\nthe COVID-l9 pandemic compel Ms. Maxwell’s release pursuant to appropriate bail conditions.\nFour months ago, this Court held in United States v. Stephens, l5-CR-95 (AJN), 2o2o WL\nl295l55 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l9, 2o2o), that COVID-l9 is an “unprecedented and extraordinarily\ndangerous” threat that justifies release on bail. /d. at *2. In that case, the defendant, who had no\nunderlying medical conditions, filed an emergency motion for reconsideration of the Court’s\n\nb\nDOJ-OGR-oool9883\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019887.jpg": "Case 922 lcrDISSCUAUIN DstamteHPl &Pitdd B77 POH Pagers St 2o\ndocuments and other evidence from approximately twenty-five years ago and meaningfully assist\nin the preparation of her defense. These restrictions are additional “compelling reasons”\njustifying her release. See id.®\nII. The Government Has Not Carried Its Burden Under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42,\n\nThe grave concerns raised by the current COVID-l9 crisis notwithstanding, Ms. Maxwell\nmust be released because she has met her limited burden of production shouing that she does not\npose a flight risk, and the government has entirely failed to demonstrate that no release <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>\nor combination of conditions exist that will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s presence in court.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nAs the Supreme Court has recognized, “[i]n our society liberty is the norm, and detention\nprior to trial or without trial is the carefully limited exception.” United States v. Salerno, 48l\nU.S. 739, 755 (l987). Pretrial detention is appropriate only where “no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the [defendant].” United States v.\nSabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (quoting l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)). The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that a court “shall order the pretrial release” of the defendant (l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(b))\n(emphasis added), but may impose bail conditions if “such release will not reasonably assure the\nappearance” of the defendant in court. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c). Where conditions are necessary,\nsuch release shall be “subject to the /east restrictive . . . set of conditions that [the court]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.” l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(c)(l)(B) (emphasis added). Consequently, “[u]nder this statutory scheme, ‘it is only a\nlimited group of offenders who should be denied bail pending trial.’” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited).\n\n8 See also Leter of Sean Hecker to Hon. Margo K. Brodie (July 8, 2o2o), Federal Defenders of New York, Inc. v.\nFederal Bureau of Prisons, et al., No. l9 Civ. 66o (E.D.N.Y.) (Doc.

First, the government\nmust shou “by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant . . . presents an actual risk of\nflight.” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75 (emphasis added). If the government is able to satisfy this\nburden, it must then “demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or\ncombination of conditions could be imposed on the defendant that would reasonably assure his\npresence in court.” Jd.\n\nIn determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the defendant, the court must consider (l) the nature and circumstances of the\noffense charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; (3) the history and\ncharacteristics of the person; and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or\nthe community that would be posed by the person’s release. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nIn this case, unlike in the Epstein case, the government does not contend that Ms.\nMaxwell poses any danger to the community, and therefore the fourth factor does not apply.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act contains a rebutable presumption, applicable based on certain of\nthe crimes charged here, that no conditions will reasonably assure against flight. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(3)(E). In cases where this presumption applies, the “defendant bears a limited burden of\nproduction—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with\nevidence that [she] does not pose . . . a risk of flight.” See United States v. English, 629 F.3d\n3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quotation omited). This rebutable presumption can be readily\nsatisfied, United States v. Conway, No. 4-ll—7o756 MAG (DMR), 2oll WL 342l32l, at *2\n(N.D. Cal. Aug. 3, 2oll), and “[a]ny evidence favorable to a defendant that comes within a\ncategory listed in § 3l42(g) can affect the operation” of the presumption.

As set forth belou, Ms.\nMaxwell’s personal history, her family and other ties to this country, and her conduct prior\nto her arrest easily rebut the presumption that she presents a risk of flight. For these same\nreasons, the government cannot establish that the strict bail conditions she proposes, which\nare consistent with a number of cases in this Circuit in which courts have ordered release,\nwill not “reasonably assure” her presence in court.

Ms. Maxwell also has significant ties to the United States. She has lived in this\ncountry for almost 3o years and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2oo2. Ms. Maxwell\nalso has strong family ties to this country. Two of her sisters, who have agreed to co-sign\nher bond, live in the United States, and they have several children who are U.S.-born\ncitizens. Ms. Maxwell is very close with her sisters and maintains regular contact with\nthem, as well as with her nieces and nephews.

To the contrary, Ms.\nMaxwell has always vehemently denied that she was involved in illegal or improper conduct\nrelated to Epstein, and her conduct has been entirely consistent with someone who fully\nintends to remain in this country and fight any allegations brought against her.

Ms.\nMaxwell therefore did what any responsible person would do — she separated herself from\neveryone she cares about and removed herself from the public eye in order to keep herself and\nher friends out of harm’s way.'”\n\nLacking any evidence required under the governing standard that Ms. Maxwell\npresents an “actual risk of flight,” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75, the government’s flight risk\nargument is reduced to the follouing: Ms. Maxwell is a woman of means who has foreign\ncitizenship and has traveled internationally in the past, and who nou faces serious charges.\nBut if that were sufficient, then virtually every defendant with a foreign passport and any\nmeaningful amount of funds would need to be detained as a flight risk. See Hung v. United\nStates 439 U.S. l326, l329 (l978) (to detain based on risk of flight, government must shou\nmore than “opportunities for flight,’ and instead must establish an “inclination on the part of\n[the defendant] to flee”). That is not what the Bail Reform Act requires. Indeed, courts in\nthis Circuit and elsewhere commonly find that bail conditions can adequately address risk of\nflight, even where individuals have foreign citizenship and passports or otherwise substantial\nforeign connections, and financial means. See, e.g., Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 66; United States v.\nHansen, lo8 F. App’x 33l (6th Cir. 2oo4); United States v. Hanson, 6l3 F. Supp. 2d 85 (D.D.C.\n2oo9); United States v.

At the heart of this case are brave women\nwho are victims of serious crimes that demand justice. The defendant’s motion wholly fails to\nappreciate the driving force behind this case: the defendant’s victims were sexually abused as\nminors as a direct result of Ghislaine Maxwell’s actions, and they have carried the trauma from\nthese events for their entire adult lives. They deserve to see her brought to justice at a trial.\n\nThere will be no trial for the victims if the defendant is afforded the opportunity to flee the\njurisdiction, and there is every reason to think that is exactly what she will do if she is released.\nFor the reasons detailed in the Detention Memorandum, and as further discussed belou, the\ndefendant poses a clear risk of flight, and no conditions of bail could reasonably assure her\ncontinued appearance in this case. Among other concerns: (l) she is a citizen of a country that\ndoes not extradite its oun citizens; (2) she appears to have access to considerable wealth\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oool99o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019906.jpg": "Casesb:2o-S8oo68oHAEN ISaCuMEent 2o2 FileensA3G/PtagPagev26nl9\n\nFinally, the Government recognizes that the COVID-l9 pandemic is — and should be — a\nrelevant factor for the Court and the parties in this case. Houever, the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”)\nis taking very significant steps to address that concern, and the defendant has offered no reason\nwhy she should be treated any differently from the many defendants who are currently detained at\nthe Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) pending trial, including defendants who have medical\nconditions that place them at heightened risk. Inmates at the MDC are able to assist in their oun\ndefense, especially long before trial, through established policies and procedures applicable to\nevery pretrial detainee.

The Defendant’s Victims Seek Detention\n\nAs the Court is aware, pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (“CVRA”), a crime\nvictim has the right to be reasonably heard at certain public proceedings in the district court,\nincluding proceedings involving release. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4).

For years before\nher arrest in this case, the defendant likely believed she had goten away with her crimes. That\nillusion has nou been shatered, and she has a host of new reasons to use her considerable resources\nto flee.\n\nMoreover, the defendant’s willingness to brazenly lie under oath about her conduct,\nincluding some of the conduct charged in the Indictment, strongly suggests her true motive has\nbeen and remains to avoid being held accountable for her crimes, rather than to avoid the media.\nAs alleged in the Indictment, in 2ol6, when the defendant was given the opportunity to address\nher conduct with minors in the context ofa civil suit, she lied repeatedly. Those lies are, of course,\nthe subject of two counts of perjury, and they evidence her willingness to flout the law in order to\nprotect herself. The defendant’s lies under oath should give the Court serious pause about trusting\nthis defendant to comply with conditions of bail.\n\nIV. The Defendant’s Bail Proposal Offers No Security For Her Appearance\n\nIn its opening memorandum, the Government highlighted the defendant’s extensive means\nto flee and her opaque finances. In her response, the defendant’s brief provides zero information\nabout her assets in the United States or abroad. The Court should be troubled by this. First, so\nfar as the Government is aware, the defendant has not filled out a financial affidavit, under penalty\nof perjury, in connection with her application for bail, meaning that the Court has no reliable\ninsight into the magnitude or scope of the defendant’s resources. Houever, what the Court does\nhave are strong indicia that the defendant has access to enormous resources, including the large\nproperty she was found on, the private security guard being retained to live with her on that\n* The Government understands from Pretrial Services that the defendant has indicated that she has\nless than a million dollars in bank accounts. The report has not yet been released. As discussed\nbelou, the Court should have serious pause before accepting this unverified information.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oool99l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019913.jpg": "CaSade2Oteh)d3GouAunnt Bib eutre/otl 22o 2Fil ed OFAL8) 26a deageot 2 Of l9\nproperty, and the multi-million dollar property in the United Kingdom being offered as collateral.\nIndeed, it is revealing that the defendant’s memorandum declines to discuss her assets or the assets\nto which she plainly has access. Without knouing the full scope of the defendant’s financial\nresources, it would be impossible for the Court to even begin to evaluate whether conditions of\nbail would mitigate her risk of flight. More importantly, the defendant cannot claim that she has\nmet her significant burden to rebut the presumption of detention in this case when she has failed\nto provide comprehensive, verified financial information under penalty of perjury.\n\nAlthough the Government submits that no conditions of bail could reasonably assure the\ndefendant’s continued appearance, the defendant’s proposed bail package offers almost no security\nwhatsoever. The defendant appears to have significant assets, she has extensive foreign ties and\nis a citizen of a country that does not extradite its citizens to the United States, and she is charged\nwith serious crimes involving the sexual exploitation of minors — and yet, she asks the Court to\ngrant her bail secured only by a foreign property, which provides effectively no security at all.\n\nIndeed, it is curious that a defendant who appears to have access to millions of dollars has\nnot offered to post a single dime as collateral for the bond she proposes. Instead, as noted, she\noffers as security a foreign property, which is effectively meaningless. As a practical mater, the\nGovernment has no direct way to proceed against foreign property or sureties through bail\nforfeiture, because the Government cannot seize a foreign citizen’s assets abroad or sell property\nin another nation based on a United States bail forfeiture judgment. The Government would be\nrequired to atempt to litigate a property dispute in another country, with a lengthy process and an\nuncertain outcome.\n\nAdditionally, the defendant proffers no information about her proposed co-signers other\nthan that they are friends and relatives — in particular, she provides no information about the assets\nlo\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool99l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019917.jpg": "CaSade2Oter)d3GoouAunnt Bib eure 22o 2Fil e@ FAL) 26a deageot S OP l9\nthan any other inmate at the MDC, and thus she cannot claim any greater need for bail than the\nmany inmates awaiting trial there.*\n\nThe virus, of course, presents new and complex challenges for protecting inmates’ health,\nbut the BOP generally, and the MDC specifically, are prepared to handle the risks presented by\nCOVID-l9 and other health issues.

We appreciate that,\n\n6 your Honor.\n\n7 Your Honor, this is a very important proceeding for my\n8 client. It is critical and we submit, as we laid out in our\n\n9 papers, that under the Bail Reform Act and related case law,\n\nlo none of which, by the way, was discussed in the government's\n\nll presentation, she is -- she ought to be released on a bail\n\nl2 package with strict conditions, your Honor.\n\nl3 And, frankly, in order to defend a case like this\n\nl4 during the COVID crisis, with the extent of discovery which was\nl5 discussed earlier in the proceeding, that's going to take the\nl6 government until November to produce to us, the notion of\n\nl7 preparing a defense with our client while she is in custody\n\nl8 under these conditions is just not realistic.\n\nl9 I would also like to take a moment, your Honor, to\n2o address a few things. As we noted in our papers, our client is\n2l not Jeffrey Epstein, and she has been the target of essentially\n22 endless media spin that apparently the government has picked up\n23 in its reply brief and in its presentation today, trying to\n24 portray her before the court as a ruthless, aimless, sinister\n25 person.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool9964\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019967.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 39-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Pagelo8 of 2oo 45\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl 377(l), and we understand that the court is follouing the\n\n2 statute. The statute gives alleged victims the right to speak\n3 through counsel, through the government, or directly, and be\n\n4 heard, and we understand that, your Honor.\n\n5 The question today before the court, we submit, is\n\n6 whether or not our client could be released or should be\n\n7 released on a <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions to assure\n8 her appearance. And as to that question, the presentations\n\n9 today do not speak, they do not speak to risk of flight, and\nlo the courts have -- in this circuit have thought about and\n\nll researched what weight should be given to that. There is an\nl2 opinion by Judge Orenstein in the Hastern District, United\n\nl3 States v. Turner, from April 2oo5, not cited by the government,\nl4 in which the court, after carefully surveying the legislative\nl5 history and background of the CVRA and its interplay with the\nl6 bail reform statute, concluded, \"In considering hou to ensure\nl7 that the rights are afforded, I am cognizant that the new law\nl8 gives crime victims a voice but not a veto. Of particular\n\nl9 relevance to this case, a court's obligation to protect the\n2o victim's rights and to carefully consider any objections that\n2l victim may have never requires it to deny a defendant release\n22 on conditions that will adequately secure the defendant's\n23 appearance,\" going on to cite the Senate legislative history\n24 that's being cited with approval of United States v. Rubin,\n25 also an Eastern District case.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool9967\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019968.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 39-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Pagelo9 of 2oo 46\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl So we understand why the court has to follou this\n\n2 process, but we submit that these presentations just are not\n\n3 relevant to the determination before the court today. And,\n\n4 again, we don't have spin. The big fact that the government,\n\n5 Ms. Moe tried to put before you through the victim is that\n\n6 supposedly someone had called in a civil action threatening the\n7 two-year-old child. Notice hou carefully that was phrased,\n\n8 your Honor. It wasn't tied to Ms. Maxwell. It's more spin,\n\n9 spin, spin.\n\nlo So we are here to consider bail. We should consider\nll the statute. We should consider your Honor's guidance under\n\nl2 the statute. So let me just put that to one side. I determine\nl3 that that really disposes of the issue of what weight to give.\nl4 In turning to the statute, your Honor, turning to the\nl5 factors, I don't want to spend a lot of time on the standard,\nl6 because I knou your Honor is very familiar with it, but I do\n\nl7 want to point out that, in an opening brief and reply brief and\nl8 nou an oral presentation, the government has not once\n\nl9 represented the standard to your Honor nor the burden that it\n2o has. And that is the statute, under 3l42(c), says that \"even\n2l the case where there is not to be release ROR\" -- which this is\n22 not that case -- \"the court shall order pretrial release\n23 subject to the least restrictive <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of\n24 conditions.\" That as you nou read, of course, in light of\n25 3l42(e), (f), and (g), the provisions on detention, that the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool9968\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019969.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 39-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Pagello of 2oo 47\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl law of the statute, by its structure, favors release. The\n\n2 Supreme Court has and the Second Circuit has advised us that a\n3 very limited number of people should be detained prior to trial\n4 because of the statute's structure, and the government nouhere\n5 mentions that. It basically acts as if all it has to do is\n\n6 invoke the presumption on the client and then we are done, and\n7 that's just not the legal standing, your Honor.\n\n8 They also say nothing about the burden, which is\n\n9 discussed on a case writen for the Second Circuit by Judge\n\nlo Raggi, and also the U.S. v. English case. Without going into a\nll lot of detail, as the court is aware, the burden of persuasion\nl2 is the government's. It never shifts.

We\n2l decided that we should come before your Honor with a package\n22 that was set out subject, of course, to the ruling provided by\n23 the court, subject of course to verification as to suretors by\n24 Pretrial Services and the court.

Khashoggi, U.S. v. Bodmer, U.S.\n\n3 v. Hanson, and Sabhnani itself, all of which involve defendants\n4 with substantial connections.\n\n5 And I might follou up on your Honor's question, when\n\n6 you take off the spin and you take off the media -- and I'm\n\n7 going to get to it in a moment, because your Honor is going to\n8 allou me to respond -- here is their case: Defendant is a\n\n9 citizen of more than one country, England and France, not\n\nlo exactly exotic places. The defendant has three passports. The\nll defendant has traveled internationally in the past, not in the\nl2 past year. There is no refutation from the government on that,\nl3 and they have been all over her travel records. The defendant\nl4 has resided here in the past year. She has traveled\n\nl5 internationally and, according to the government, she has\n\nl6 financial means. I will get to that in a moment, Judge. But\nl7 let's assume for the purposes of this discussion that she has\nl8 financial means and not the lies that the government laid out.\nl9 What do those cases teach? They teach that that is something\n2o the court can and should address in the bail conditions. They\n2l teach that they may require stricter bail conditions. They\n22 don't teach that that means there should be no bail at all. In\n23 Sabhnani, a Second Circuit case, the allegation was that the\n24 defendants have held two individuals in slavery for five years,\n25 and they had many more international ties or international\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool997l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019972.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 39-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Pagell3 of 2oo 5o\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl travel than alleged as to our client, certainly in the past\n\n2 year, and strict release was approved with strict bail\n\n3 conditions.\n\n4 In Bodmer, which was before Judge Scheindlin in 2oo4,\niy the defendant was a Swiss citizen, and Switzerland had taken\n\n6 the position it would not extradite its citizens for\n\n7 proceedings in the United States. And Judge Scheindlin\n\n8 observed, well, if that becomes the test for bail, then no\n\n9 citizen of Switzerland can ever get bail in the United States.\nlo So, too, here. If that's the test for France, then no French\nll citizen, under the government's reasoning, could ever get bail\nl2 in the United States.\n\nl3 And in Bodmer it was even the allegation -- the case\nl4 was a fraud case -- the allegation was that the defendant who\nl5 was a Swiss atorney had, according to the government, been\n\nl6 opening up Swiss accounts overseas and that that was some form\nl7 of hiding. Even with all that, the court said what many courts\nl8 have said in this courthouse, to be addressed in the\n\nl9 conditions.

This bail proceeding should not turn into some\n\n9 mini investigation of our client's finances.

A finding of dangerousness, if\n\n9 that were an issue, must be supported by clear and convincing\nlo evidence. A finding that a defendant is a flight risk must be\nll supported by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\nl2 In a case such as this one, where the defendant is\n\nl3 accused of certain offenses involving a minor victim, federal\nl4 law requires that it shall be presumed that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or\n\nl5 combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance\nl6 of the person as required.

The leter further\nexplains that Ms. Maxwell was forced to leave her family and drop out of the public\neye, not because she was trying to evade law enforcement, but because the intense\nmedia frenzy and threats follouing the arrest and death of Jeffrey Epstein threatened\nthe safety and wellbeing of herself and her family, Ee For\nthese same reasons, Ms. Maxwell’s spouse did not come forward as a co-signer at the\ntime of the initial hearing.

The\nsureties also describe the significant financial distress they would suffer if Ms.\nMaxwell were to violate her bail conditions. (Exs. B-N, W-X).\n\n¢ Financial report. The financial report, prepared by the accounting firm Macalvins\nLimited, provides an accounting of Ms. Maxwell’s financial <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> from 2ol5-\n2o2o, and discloses (i) all of her oun assets, (ll) all assets held in trust, and (ll) all of\nthe assets held by her spouse over that same time period.

Far from creating a flight risk, the lack of corroboration\nonly reinforces Ms. Maxwell's conviction that she has been falsely accused and\nstrengthens her long-standing desire to face the allegations against her and clear\nher name in court.\n¢ Oppressive conditions of confinement. Ms. Maxwell has nou been detained\nfor over l5o days in the equivalent of solitary confinement since she was\nindicted and arrested on July 2, 2o2o, despite the fact that she is not a suicide\nrisk and has not received a single disciplinary infraction. The draconian\nconditions to which Ms. Maxwell is subjected are not only unjust and\npunitive, but also impair her ability to review the voluminous discovery\nproduced by the government and to participate meaningfully in the\npreparation of her defense. Furthermore, the recent COVID-l9 outbreak\nat the MDC threatens her safety and well-being.\nMs. Maxwell Should Be Placed on Restrictive Bail Conditions\nDuring her more than five months in isolation, Ms. Maxwell has had to watch as she has\nbeen relentlessly atacked in a deluge of media articles that spiked over a year ago when Epstein\n?

Indeed, in the three months after her arrest, Ms.\nMaxwell was the subject of over 6,5oo national media articles. That exceeds the number of\narticles that mentioned such high-profile defendants as Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby, Joaquin\n“El Chapo” Guzman Loera, and Keith Raniere in the 9o-day period follouing their arrests,\ncombined. The media coverage has ruthlessly vilified her and prejudged her guilt, and has\nexposed her family and friends to harassment, physical threats, and other negative consequences.\n\nBut Ms. Maxwell is not the person the media has portrayed her to be; far from it. And\nher response to these unfounded allegations remains unchanged: she resolutely and vehemently\ndenies them, and she is steadfastly commited to remaining in this country, where she has been\nsince Epstein’s arrest in July 2ol9, to fight them in court. For Ms. Maxwell to flee, she would\nhave to abandon her spouse ee. She will not risk destroying the lives\nand financial well-being of those she holds most dear to live as a fugitive during a worldwide\npandemic. In fact, every action Ms. Maxwell has taken from the time of Epstein’s arrest up to\nthe time of the first bail hearing was designed to protect her spouse from\nharassment, economic harm, and physical danger. Ms. Maxwell wants to stay in New York and\nhave her day in court so that she can clear her name and return to her family.\n\nJustice is not reserved solely for the victims of a crime; it is for the accused as well.\nHere, justice would be served by granting Ms. Maxwell bail under the comprehensive conditions\nwe propose. The alternative is continued detention under oppressive conditions that are\nunprecedented for a non-violent pretrial detainee, which significantly impair her ability to\nparticipate in her defense and prepare for trial and which jeopardize her physical health and\npsychological wellbeing.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo26\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020027.jpg": "Caesast:2o-S8oo8RoHAEN ISSCUMENT D2 FileebBA3A/ Pag Page aB26lo45\nARGUMENT\nI.

Ms. Maxwell would never destroy those closest to her by fleeing, after they\nhave risked so much to support her.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo34\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020035.jpg": "Caesast:2o-S8oo8RoHAENt ISSCUMENT/OD2 FileebBa3A/ Page age afl26io45\nB. Ms. Maxwell Has Provided a Thorough Review of Her Finances for the\nPast Five Years\n\nThe government raised concerns at the initial bail hearing about the accuracy and\ncompleteness of the financial disclosures that Ms. Maxwell provided to Pretrial Services.\n(Dkt. 22 at ll-l2: Tr. 28-29, 34-35). The Court stated that it did not have “a clear picture of\nMs. Maxwell's finances and the resources available to her” and therefore had no way “to set\nfinancial bail conditions that could reasonably assure her appearance in court.” (Tr. 86-87).\n\nTo address the Court’s questions about Ms. Maxwell’s finances, defense counsel\nretained Macalvins, a highly reputable accounting firm in the United Kingdom, to conduct\nan analysis of Ms. Maxwell’s assets and finances for the past five years. The Macalvins\naccountants reviewed thousands of pages of financial documents, including bank statements,\ntax returns, FBAR filings, and other materials to create a clear picture of the assets held by\nMs. Maxwell and her spouse, as well as any assets held in trust for the benefit of Ms.\nMaxwell, and the source of those assets from 2ol5-2o2o. This analysis, which is based in\nsubstantial part on documents that the government provided in discovery, has involved a\nsignificant amount of work and has taken substantial time to complete. It was not possible\nto perform this analysis in the brief time between Ms. Maxwell’s arrest and the initial bail\nhearing, especially with Ms. Maxwell detained follouing her arrest.\n\nThe Macalvins report was also reviewed by i. a Certified Fraud Examiner\nand a former IRS Special Agent with over 4o years of experience in complex financial fraud\ninvestigations. As a Special Agent, f | investigated numerous financial fraud and criminal\ntax cases, including several in this District. Dl reviewed the Macalvins report and the\nunderlying documents and determined that it presents a complete and accurate summary of the\nassets held by Ms. Maxwell and her spouse, as well as assets that were, or are currently, held in\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo35\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020045.jpg": "Caesast:2o-8oo8GoHAENt ISACUMENT/ID2 FileebBA3A/ Pag Page SiL26lo45\nIndeed, the discovery reflects that it was not hard at all for the government to locate Ms.\nMaxwell when they wanted to find her by tracking her primary phone.\n\nIn sum, the cellphone clearly shous that Ms. Maxwell was not “good at” hiding or\nthat she was avoiding arrest, as the government claimed. (Tr. 3l-32). She was trying to\nprotect herself as best as she could from harassment by the press, not capture by law\nenforcement. Moreover, this should not be a bar to granting bail. The proposed conditions\nensure her presence at home in plain sight of i” (and the security guards), GPS-\nmonitored, and under strict Pretrial supervision.\n\nD. Ms. Maxwell Has Waived Her Extradition Rights and Could Not Seek\n\nRefuge in the United Kingdom or France\n\nAt the initial hearing, the government argued that Ms. Maxwell, a naturalized U.S. citizen\nwho has lived in the United States for almost 3o years, might flee to the United Kingdom or\nFrance if granted bail, despite the fact that she did not leave the country for nearly a year after\nEpstein’s arrest. (Dkt. 22 at 6.) The government asserted in its reply brief that France “does not\nextradite its citizens to the United States pursuant to French law.” (/d.) At the bail hearing, the\ngovernment represented that “France will not extradite a French citizen to the United States as a\nmater of law, even if the defendant is a dual citizen of the United States,” and that extradition by\nthe United Kingdom would be “lengthy” and “uncertain” with bail “very likely” pending the\nextradition proceeding. (Tr. 27.) These assertions are incorrect, particularly given Ms.\nMaxwell’s irrevocable waiver of her extradition rights with respect to both the United Kingdom\nand France.\n\nAs we noted for the Court at the initial hearing, the concern that Ms. Maxwell would\natempt to flee the United States is entirely unfounded given that Ms. Maxwell had every motive\nand opportunity to flee after the arrest and death of Jeffrey Epstein, but chose to remain in this\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo45\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020046.jpg": "Caesast:2o-8oo8RoHAEN ISSCUMENT/OD2 FileebBA3A/ Pag Page G226lo45\ncountry. (Dkt. l8 at l2-l4, Tr. 52-53). It is even more unfounded in light of the daily avalanche\nof media coverage of Ms. Maxwell. She is nou one of the most recognizable and infamous\npeople in the world. She is being pursued relentlessly by the press, which would no doubt be\ncamped out by her front door every day if she were granted bail. The notion that Ms. Maxwell\ncould somehou flee to a foreign country during a worldwide pandemic (presumably, by plane),\nwhile being supervised and monitored 24 hours a day and with the eyes of the global press corps\non her every minute, without being caught, is absurd.\n\nTo the extent the Court is concerned that her calculus may have changed since her arrest\nbecause the threat of prosecution has nou crystallized into concrete charges (Tr. 85-86), Ms.\nMaxwell has addressed that concern head-on—she will execute irrevocable waivers of her right\nto contest extradition in both the United Kingdom and France. (Ex. T). These waivers\ndemonstrate Ms. Maxwell’s firm commitment to remain in this country to face the charges\nagainst her. Moreover, as discussed more fully in the atached expert reports, because of these\nwaivers and other factors, it is highly unlikely that Ms. Maxwell would be able to successfully\nresist an extradition request from the United States to either country, in the extremely unlikely\nevent she were to violate her bail conditions. (Exs. U-V). Moreover, any extradition\nproceedings in either country would be resolved promptly. (/d.).\n\nCourts have addressed concerns about a defendant’s ties to a foreign state that enforces\nextradition waivers by requiring the defendant to execute such a waiver as a <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> of\nrelease—including in cases where the defendants, unlike Ms. Maxwell, were not U:S. citizens.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Cirillo, No. 99-l5l4, l999 WL l456536, at *2 (3d Cir. July l3, l999)\n(vacating district court’s detention order and reinstating magistrate’s release order, which\nrequired foreign citizen and resident to sign an “irrevocable waiver of extradition” as a <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo46\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020047.jpg": "Caesast:2o-8oo8RoHAENt ISSCUMENT D2 FileebB23o/ Pag Page SB2GIo45\nof release); United States v.

Cal. l992) (ordering as a\n<span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> of release that defendants “execute waivers of challenges to extradition from any\nnation where they may be found’’). Moreover, a defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal an\nextradition order has been recognized as an indication of the defendant’s intent not to flee. See,\ne.g., United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48, lo52 (S.D.N.Y. l989) (Judge Keenan found\ndefendant’s extradition appeal waiver “manifests an intention to remain here and face the\ncharges against him’’).\n\nIn response to the government’s assertions, Ms. Maxwell has obtained the accompanying\nreports of experts in United Kingdom and French extradition law, who have analyzed the\nlikelihood that Ms. Maxwell, in the event she were to flee to the United Kingdom or France,\nwould be able to resist extradition to the United States after having executed a waiver of her right\nto do so. Both have concluded that it is highly unlikely that she would be able to resist\nextradition successfully.\n\nUnited Kingdom. With respect to the United Kingdom, submited herewith is a report\nfrom David Perry (“Perry Rep.”), a U.K. barrister who is widely considered one of the United\nKingdom’s preeminent extradition practitioners.

(/d. at 2). Mr. Julie bases his opinion largely on (i) Ms.\nMaxwell’s U.S. citizenship; (ll) her irrevocable waiver of her extradition rights with respect to\nthe United States; (i) the fact that the issue would arise only if Ms. Maxwell had fled to France\nin violation of strict bail conditions in the United States: (iv) the fact that a failure to extradite\nwould obligate French authorities to try Ms. Maxwell in French courts for the same 25-year-old\nconduct alleged in the indictment, which did not take place in France; and (v) France’s\ndiplomatic interest in accommodating an extradition request from the United States. (/d.). Mr.\nJulie adds that the extradition process would likely be “disposed of expediently”; where the\nrequesting state emphasizes the urgent nature of the extradition request, “the extradition decree is\ngenerally issued in only a few weeks.” (/d. at 2-3). And in any event, while the extradition\nproceedings are pending, “the French judicial authorities would most certainly decide that |Ms.\nMaxwell] has to remain in custody given her flight from the USA and the violation of her bail\nterms and conditions in this requesting State.” (/d. at l2).\n\nMs. Maxwell has no intention of fleeing the country and has relinquished her nights to\ncontest extradition. She has always maintained her innocence and will continue to fight the\nallegations against her here in the United States, as she has in the past. Even if she were to flee\nafter being granted bail (which she will not), it is likely that Ms. Maxwell would be extradited\nexpeditiously from France or the United Kingdom. Accordingly, the Court should give no\nweight in the bail analysis to the fact that Ms. Maxwell is a dual citizen of these countries. ®\n* Ms. Maxwell would also have very litle incentive to flee to France. According to recent press reports, French\nauthorities recently broadened their existing criminal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein to include Ms. Maxwell.

Ms. Maxwell is not obligated to rebut every theoretical possibility that the government\nmight raise that may contribute to a potential flight risk in order to be granted bail. That is not\nthe standard. Cf United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 888 n.4, 892-93 (8th Cir. l985) (“The\nlegal standard required by the |Bail Reform] Act is one of reasonable assurances, not absolute\nguarantees.”). Ms. Maxwell has no intention of fleeing. If she did, then under the proposed bail\nconditions she would lose everything and destroy the family she has been fighting so hard to\nprotect since Epstein’s arrest. Ms. Maxwell will not do that, and should be granted bail.\n\nG. The Alternative to Bail Is Confinement Under Oppressive Conditions\n\nthat Impact Ms. Maxwell’s Health and Ability to Prepare Her Defense\n\nGranting bail to Ms. Maxwell is all the more appropriate and necessary because the past\nfew months have shoun that Ms. Maxwell cannot adequately participate in her defense and\nprepare for trial from the inside the MDC. The alternative to release is her continued\nconfinement under extraordinarily onerous conditions that are not only unjust and punitive, but\nalso meaningfully impair Ms. Maxwell’s ability to review the voluminous discovery produced by\nthe government and to communicate effectively with counsel to prepare her defense.\n\nMs. Maxwell has spent the entirety of her detention nou over five months in de facto\nsolitary confinement, under conditions that rival those used at USP Florence ADMAX to\nsupervise the most dangerous inmates in the federal system and are tantamount to imprisonment\nas a defendant convicted of capital murder and incarcerated on death rou. In fact, multiple\nwardens and interim wardens have remarked that in their collective years of experience they\nhave never seen anything like her current regime. The restrictive regulations to which Ms.\nMaxwell is subjected are not reasonably related to a legitimate goal to ensure the security of Ms.\nMaxwell or the MDC. Instead, it seems clear that the overly restrictive conditions are an\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo55\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020056.jpg": "Caseasb:2o-O8oo88oHAEN ISAC UMENT/ D2 FileebRa3o/PtagPage a2267o45\nexaggerated response to Epstein’s death, effectively punishing Ms. Maxwell for the BOP’s oun\nnegligence with respect to Epstein.\"\n\nCounsel has atempted to address the restrictions in numerous leters, emails and calls to\nthe MDC warden, the MDC legal department, and the prosecutors, but to no avail. Rather than\nrepeating these points here at length, we refer the Court to our leter to the MDC warden, dated\nOctober 29, 2o2o, which details the most serious and extraordinarily restrictive conditions of\nconfinement.’ These include:\n\n« De Facto Solitary Confinement\n\n= Excessive Surveillance\n\n= Excessive Scanning and Strip Searching\n\n« Deprivation of Food\n\n= Deprivation of Sleep\n\n# Deprivation of Communication with Family and Friends\n\n= Compromised Communication with Legal Counsel\nThe conditions of Ms. Maxwell’s detention are uterly inappropriate, and totally disproportionate\nfor a non-violent pretrial detainee with no prior criminal history facing non-violent charges a\nquarter-century old. Moreover, they adversely impact her ability to prepare her defense and\ncompromise her physical health and psychological wellbeing.\n\nIn addition to these intolerable conditions, Ms. Maxwell has had to contend with\nnumerous unacceptable delays and technical problems with the discovery that the government\nhas produced to her thus far. We have raised these issues with the prosecutors on numerous\noccasions. As we advised the Court in our leter of October 23, 2o2o, defense counsel first\n'! These conditions are especially inappropriate because Ms. Maxwell has been an exemplary inmate and has not\nreceived any disciplinary infractions since her arrest. In fact, she has been made a suicide watch inmate, which is\nthe highest and most trusted responsibility that an inmate can have. It is the height of irony that Ms. Maxwell is\nbeing constantly surveilled as if she were a suicide risk when she, herself, is trusted enough (if she were ever\nreleased from isolation) to monitor inmates who are truly at risk of suicide.\n\n2 The Warden never responded to the leter. In our response to the government’s 9o-day status report concerning\nMDC conditions, counsel requested that the Warden provide a first-hand report to the Court and counsel. Follouing\nCourt directive for a report from the MDC, MDC Legal submited a leter that recited BOP policy but failed to\naddress a number of concerns.\n36\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo56\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020058.jpg": "Caesast:2o-8oo8RoHAEN ISACUMENT D2 FileebB23o/ Pag Page aH426lo45\n\nMs. Maxwell’s quarantine period also resulted in cancellation of weekly in-person legal\nvisits.

She is determined to ensure that her sureties and her\nfamily do not suffer because of any breach of the terms of her bond. We have presented a\nsubstantial bail package that satisfies the concerns of the Court and the government, which\ncontains more than ample security and safeguards to reasonably assure that Ms. Maxwell\nremains in New York and appears in court.

In short, the defendant poses an extreme\nflight risk, no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions can reasonably ensure her appearance in this\nDistrict, and the Court should not alter its prior finding to that effect.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAs detailed in the Indictment, the defendant is charged with facilitating the sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims by Jeffrey Epstein between approximately l994 and l997. The defendant\nplayed a critical role in the scheme by helping to identify, entice, and groom minor girls to engage\nin sex acts with Epstein. The defendant’s presence as an adult woman normalized Epstein’s\nabusive behavior, and she even took part in at least some acts of sexual abuse. Together, the\ndefendant and Epstein conspired to entice and cause minor victims to travel to Epstein’s residences\nin different states, which the defendant knew and intended would result in their grooming for and\nsubjection to sexual abuse. Then, in an effort to cover up her crimes, the defendant lied under oath\nduring a civil deposition, including when asked about her interactions with minor girls.\n\nBased on that conduct, the Indictment charges the defendant in six counts. Count One\ncharges the defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage\nin illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Count Two charges the defendant with enticing\na minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2. Count\nThree charges the defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minors to\nparticipate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Count Four charges the defendant\nwith transporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2423 and 2.\nCounts Five and Six charge the defendant with perjury, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l623.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo65\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020066.jpg": "Caseabe? o-cs6o 8B GHANA DEMME? loo2 Filed6R238/7HgPAge Boat 36\n\nOn July 2, 2o2o, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) arrested the defendant.\nFollouing extensive briefing, on July l4, 2o2o, the Court held a lengthy bail hearing. In its writen\nand oral submissions, the defense urged the Court to release the defendant on bail.\n\nAmong other things, the defense emphasized the defendant’s family ties and residence in\nthe United States (Dkt. l8 at 2, 3, l2), offered to hire a private security company to monitor the\ndefendant (/d. at 2o), noted that the defendant remained in the country and was in touch with the\nGovernment through counsel follouing Epstein’s arrest (Dkt. l8 at l2-l3; Tr. 49, 52-55), argued\nthat the defendant went into hiding to avoid a media frenzy (Dkt. l8 at l4-l6; Tr. 55-56), and\nargued that detention would hamper the ability to prepare a defense (Tr. 42, 67-69). Responding\nto the Government’s concerns about the lack of transparency about the defendant’s finances and\nsix proposed co-signers, the defense specifically asked the Court to keep the proceedings open if\nthe Court believed additional information or a more fulsome bond would be useful to the bail\ndetermination. (Tr. 52 (“And if the court determines that the conditions that we have proffered are\ninsufficient or need further verification, as long as we can have some assurance of safety and\nconfidentiality, we would recommend that the court keep the proceeding open, and we should be\nable to get whatever the court needs to satisfy it.”); Tr. 59 (“Even if the court were to assume for\npurposes of today’s proceeding that she has the means that the government claims she does, it does\nnot affect the analysis. That is to be addressed in conditions, to be addressed if the court requires\nit, through verifications and further proceedings before the court.”); Tr. 66 (“If the court desires to\nleave the proceeding open for a week and allou us to come back, if the court has concerns about\nthe number of suretors, for example, verification information, information about financial issues,\nwe think that, nou that we have some ability to breathe a litle bit, that we should be able to pull\nthis together for the court’s consideration.”); Tr. 7o (“And if the court needs more information\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo66\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020067.jpg": "Caseabe? o-cs6o 8B GHANA DEcuMe? loo2 Filed6R238/7tHgPage Test 36\nfrom us, we would respectfully request that the court leave the proceeding open for a week so that\nwe can try to satisfy the court because we want to.”)).\n\nThe Court declined the defense’s request and instead concluded that the defendant posed a\nserious flight risk and that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance. First, the\nCourt found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense here weigh in favor of detention,”\ngiven the statutory presumption of detention triggered by charges involving minor victims and the\npotential penalties those charges carry. (Tr. 82). Second, the Court determined that “[t]he\ngovernment’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong” based on the “multiple\nvictims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in serious crimes,” as well\nas corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Jd.).\nThird, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics demonstrate that the\ndefendant poses a risk of flight. (Tr. 83).\n\nIn addressing that third factor, the Court emphasized the defendant’s “substantial\ninternational ties,’ which “could facilitate living abroad,’ including “multiple foreign\ncitizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least one foreign property of\nsignificant value.” (Tr. 83). The Court also noted that the defendant “is a citizen of France, a\nnation that does not appear to extradite its citizens.” (/d.). The Court further found that the\ndefendant “possesses extraordinary financial resources” and that “the representations made to\nPretrial Services regarding the defendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid\npicture of the resources available.” (Tr. 83-84).\n\nAlthough the Court recognized that the defendant “does have some family and personal\nconnections to the United States,” the Court highlighted “the absence of any dependents,\nsignificant family ties or employment in the United States” in support of the conclusion that “flight\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo67\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020068.jpg": "Caseabe? o-c6o8BG+ANt DEcuMEr? loo2 Filed6R238/7tHgPage Boat 36\n\nwould not pose an insurmountable burden for her.” (Tr. 84). The Court recognized the defense\narguments that the defendant did not leave the United States after Epstein’s arrest and was in\ncontact with the Government through counsel, but emphasized that the defendant may have\nexpected that she would not be prosecuted. (Tr. 84-85). The Court also noted that the defendant\n“did not provide the government with her whereabouts,” and that the “[c]ircumstances of her arrest\n... may cast some doubt on the claim that she was not hiding from the government, a claim that\nshe makes throughout the papers and here today, but even if true, the reality that Ms. Maxwell may\nface such serious charges herself may not have set in until she was actually indicted.” (Tr. 85).\nBased on all of those factors, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of\ndemonstrating that the defendant “poses a substantial actual risk of flight.” (Tr. 86).\n\nThe Court then concluded that “even the most restrictive conditions of release would be\ninsufficient” to ensure the defendant’s appearance. (/d.). Acknouledging that the defense’s initial\nbail package represented only a fraction of the defendant’s assets, the Court found that “even a\nsubstantially larger package would be insufficient.” (/d.). Although the defendant “apparently\nfailed to submit a full accounting or even close to full accounting of her financial situation,” the\nCourt implicitly rejected the defense’s offer to provide additional information by determining that\n““/e/ven if the picture of her financial resources were not opaque, as it is, detention would still be\nappropriate.” (Tr. 86-87 (emphasis added)). That conclusion was informed not only by the\ndefendant’s “significant financial resources,” but also her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (Tr. 87). “Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nfrom the press and the public,” the Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent conduct\nunderscores her extraordinary capacity to evade detection, even in the face of what the defense has\nacknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.). Given that sophistication,\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo68\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020069.jpg": "CaSedeZ2ot ep C33ouAUNIt Bescutrentl loo2 lF iG 422o8/2 o9g Pagel I ob 36\n\nthe Court concluded that electronic monitoring and home security guards “would be insufficient”\nbecause the defendant could remove the monitor and evade security guards. (Tr. 87-88). Finally,\nthe Court rejected the defense’s arguments about the risks of COVID-l9 and the difficulty of\npreparing a defense with an incarcerated client. In so doing, the Court noted that the defendant\nhas no underlying conditions that place her at heightened risk of complications from COVID-l9\nand emphasized that the defendant had many months to prepare for trial. (Tr. 89-9o).\n\nViewing all of these factors together, the Court ordered the defendant detained pending\ntrial. (Tr. 9l).\n\nAPPLICABLE LAW\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant detained pending trial upon a determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). When seeking detention on this ground, “[t]he Government bears the\nburden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence both that the defendant ‘presents an actual\nrisk of flight’ and that ‘no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions could be imposed on the\ndefendant that would reasonably assure his presence in court.’” United States v. Boustani, 932\nF.3d 79, 8l (2d Cir. 2ol9) (quoting United States v. Sabhani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7)). The\nBail Reform Act lists three factors to be considered in the detention analysis when the Government\nseeks detention based on flight risk: (l) the nature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2)\nthe weight of the evidence against the person; and (3) the history and characteristics of the\ndefendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and] financial resources.” See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(¢g). If a judicial officer concludes that “no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions will\nreasonably assure the appearance of the person as required . . . such judicial officer shall order the\ndetention of the person before trial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo69\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020070.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o BROAN DEctIMert loo2 Filed6Ra38/FHgPagetl Oost 36\n\nAdditionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with commiting an offense involving\na minor victim under l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, it shall be presumed, subject to rebutal, that no\n<span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as\nrequired and the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). In such a case, “the\ndefendant ‘bears a limited burden of production—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut\nthat presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose . . . a risk of flight.’”\nUnited States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting United States v. Mercedes,\n254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool)). The act of producing such evidence, houever, “does not\neliminate the presumption favoring detention.” /d. Rather, the presumption “remains a factor to\nbe considered among those weighed by the district court,’ while the Government retains the\nultimate burden of demonstrating that the defendant presents a risk of flight. Mercedes, 254 F.3d\nat 436.\n\nWhen the Court has already issued a detention order, the Bail Reform Act provides that the\ndetention hearing “may be reopened . . . if the judicial officer finds that information exists that was\nnot knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue of\nwhether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the appearance” of the\ndefendant. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f). Accordingly, “[a] court may properly reject an atempt to reopen\na detention hearing where the new information presented is immaterial to the issue of flight risk.”\nUnited States v. Petrov, l5 Cr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26,\n2ol5). Although courts in this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered\neven where the evidence proffered on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the\noriginal hearing,” United States v. Roue, o2 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y.\nMay 2l, 2oo3), generally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo7o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020071.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o BROAN BEciuMert loo2 Filed6Ra38/FgPagetlisef 36\nreconsideration” by, for example, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or\nincorrectly applied the law,” or that failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.”\nPetrov, 2ol5 WL llo2286 at *3.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nHaving already raised numerous arguments in its briefing and oral argument at the initial\nbail hearing in this case, the defense nou asks this Court to reverse itself based on virtually the\nsame arguments it already rejected. The Renewed Bail Application largely reiterates the same\nclaims regarding the defendant’s ties to the United States and her behavior after Epstein’s arrest\nthat the Court already found unpersuasive. To the extent the Renewed Bail Application presents\nnew information, it consists primarily of financial data that was certainly knoun to the defendant\nat the time of her initial bail application and that the Court already assumed could be made\navailable (and thus rejected as immaterial) when ordering detention. Ultimately, nothing in the\nRenewed Bail Application alters the analysis that led this Court to conclude that the defendant\n“poses a substantial actual risk of flight,” and that no combination of conditions could assure her\nappearance. (Tr. 86). All three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors still weigh heavily in favor\nof detention, and the defense claims to the contrary do not warrant a revisiting of this Court’s well-\nreasoned and thorough prior decision.\n\nA. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense\n\nThe first Bail Reform Act factor indisputably weighs in favor of detention in this case. The\negregious conduct charged in the Indictment gives rise to a statutory presumption of detention, and\nthe Renewed Bail Motion makes no effort to challenge this Court’s prior conclusion that the nature\nand circumstances of the offense support detention. The charges in the Indictment describe\nhorrendous conduct involving the sexual abuse of multiple minor victims. If convicted, the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo7l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020078.jpg": "Caseab2 o-6o 8RGHANAt BEctIMert loo2 Filed6RaI38/7tgPagetlB6af 36\ndemonstrated ability to live in hiding—numerous courts have recognized that purported waivers\nof extradition are unenforceable and effectively meaningless.

In the cases cited by the defendant, the courts approved\nthe release of the defendants based on the particular facts, but did not address at all the question of\nwhether a waiver of extradition is enforceable. See United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48,\nlo5o-52 (S.D.N.Y. l989) (noting, among other things, that the Government’s case was “novel,”\nand presented an “untried theory of liability” and that the defendant not only waived his right to\nappeal extradition in Switzerland but that he traveled immediately to the United States for\narraignment, and that his country’s government commited to ensuring his appearance at trial);\nUnited States v. Salvagno, 3l4 F. Supp. 2d ll5, ll9 (N.D.N.Y. 2oo4) (denying Government\nmotion to remand after trial where court found defendant not likely to flee); United States v. Chen,\n82o F.

Sept. 22, 2oo8) (distinguishing Cirillo on the facts and\nnoting that “defense counsel concedes that a waiver of extradition may not be enforceable in\nCanada, a fact the court in Ciri//o did not mention in its opinion”).\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo78\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020082.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o BROAN DEctMert loo2 Filed6R238/?tgPagel 26st 36\nto authorities in the United States would not be binding in the United Kingdom, and the defendant\ncould easily decide not to consent to extradition once found abroad.\n\nFurther, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on extradition\nbased on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the passage of\ntime, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>. See, e.g., id. at\n§§ 82, 83A, & 9l. Even if a final order of extradition has been entered by a court, the Secretary\nof State still has the discretion to deny extradition. See id. at § 93. The Government understands\nfrom OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently extensively litigated, uncertain,\nand subject to multiple levels of appeal. Moreover, even where the process is ultimately\nsuccessful, it is lengthy and time-consuming.\n\nUltimately, although the defendant purports to be willing to waive her right to challenge\nbeing extradited to the United States, she simply cannot do so under the laws of France and the\nUnited Kingdom, and she would be free to fight extradition once in those countries. And, of\ncourse, the defendant could choose to flee to another jurisdiction altogether, including one with\nwhich the United States does not have an extradition treaty. The defendant’s writen waivers of\nextradition from France and the United Kingdom certainly provide no guarantee that the defendant\nwill not flee to a third country from which, even if she can be located, extradition may be\nimpossible. Courts have recognized that lack of an effective means of extradition can increase a\ndefendant’s flight risk, and have cited such facts as a relevant consideration in detaining defendants\npending trial. See, e.g., United States v. Namer, 238 F.3d 425, 2ooo WL l872ol2, at *2 (6th Cir.\nDec. l2, 2ooo); Cilins, 2ol3 WL 38o2ol2 at *2; United States v. Abdullahu, 488 F. Supp. 2d 433,\n443 (D.N.J. 2oo7) (“The inability to extradite defendant should he flee weighs in favor of\ndetention.”). Beyond being impossible to guarantee, extradition is typically a lengthy,\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo82\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020086.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o8RGlANAt DEctIMeri loo2 Filed6R2a38/?HgPaAgeG6af 36\nthis Court already weighed in favor of detention, and confirmation of that deception only\nreemphasizes that this defendant cannot be trusted to comply with bail conditions.\n\nNou, the defense has submited a financial report that reflects the defendant has\napproximately $22 million in assets—far more than the figure she initially reported to Pretrial\nServices. (Def. Ex. O). Accepting the financial report at face value, it is clear that the defense’s\nproposed bail package would leave the defendant with substantial resources to flee the country.\nNot only would she have millions of dollars in unrestrained assets at her disposal,° but she would\nalso have a $2 million tounhouse in London, which she could live in or sell to support herself. In\nother words, even with the proposed bond—which is only partially secured—the defendant would\nstill have millions of dollars at her disposal. She could absolutely afford to leave her friends and\nfamily to lose whatever they may pledge to support her bond, and then repay them much of their\nlosses. In fact, the defendant could transfer money to her proposed co-signers immediately\nfollouing her release,’ given the large sums of money that would be left unrestrained by her\nproposed bail package.\n\nMoreover, the schedule provided by the defense is notably silent regarding any future\nrevenue streams to which the defendant may have access. The financial report only addresses the\ndefendant’s assets without detailing her income at all. The defendant has similarly provided the\nCourt with no information about what resources her spouse might have access to on a prospective\n® In particular, according to the report, the defendant would have more than $4 million in\nunrestrained funds in accounts, in addition to hundreds of thousands of dollars of jewelry and other\nitems. Moreover, the Government presumes the defendant has not yet spent all $7 million of the\nretainer paid to her atorneys, which would still belong to the defendant if she fled.\n\n7 The Government notes that two of the defendant’s proposed co-signers are citizens and residents\nof the United Kingdom, against whom the Government could not realistically recover a bond\namount. These co-signers have not offered to secure this bond with any cash or property, and as\na result, such a bond would effectively be worthless if the defendant were to flee.\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo86\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020087.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o8RGANAt BEctuMert loo2 Filed6R298/PtagPagel Tost 36\nbasis, in addition to their substantial assets. The financial report submited by the defense is also\ncareful to note that it does not account for any possible income from inheritances. (Def. Ex. O at\na\n\nThe financial report further shous that the defendant apparently spent the last five years\nmoving the majority of her assets out of her name by funneling them through trusts to her spouse.\nThat patern suggests the defendant has used the process of transferring assets as a means to hide\nher true wealth. As the Renewed Bail Application points out, the defendant currently has\napproximately $3.4 million worth of assets held in her oun name, which is close to the amount of\nwealth she told Pretrial Services she possessed in July 2o2o. Importantly, though, that number\nomits the millions of dollars of assets that she has transferred from her name through trust accounts\nto her spouse, including funds that were used to purchase the New Hampshire property where the\ndefendant was residing when she was arrested. This confirms that the Government was right to\nbe concerned that the defendant had refused to identify her spouse or his assets to Pretrial Services.\nThat practice further demonstrates the defendant’s sophistication in hiding her assets and\nmaintaining assets that are under her control in other names.\n\nIn this vein, the financial report suggests that the defendant originally brought more than\n$2o million to her marriage, but that her husband brought only $2oo,ooo.? (See Def. Ex. O at lo).\n8 On this score, it bears noting that that defendant told Pretrial Services that the property was ouned\nby a corporation, and that she was “just able to stay there.” (Pretrial Services Report at 2). The\ndefendant’s lack of candor does not inspire confidence that she can be trusted to comply with bail\nconditions.\n\n° The Government has not been able to verify this financial information—in part because the\ndefense has declined to provide the Government with the spouse’s current banking information—\n24\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo87\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020088.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o8BGHANt DEctIMe ri loo2 Filed6R238/?tgPage staf 36\nSeting aside whether the defendant’s spouse has additional assets beyond those included in the\nfinancial report, the vast majority of the assets contained in the report itself apparently originated\nwith the defendant. (See Def. Ex. O at lo). Based on the report, it seems clear that the defendant\nslouly funneled the majority of her wealth to trusts and into her husband’s name over the last five\nyears. As a result, if the Court were to grant the defendant’s proposed bail package and the\ndefendant were to flee, her spouse would primarily lose the money that the defendant gave him\nrather than his oun independent assets. In other words, were the defendant to flee, she would\nlargely be sacrificing her oun money and assets, thereby limiting the moral suasion of her spouse\nco-signing the bond. In sum, the defendant’s submission does not change the Government’s\nposition at the original bail hearing that the defendant has considerable financial resources, and\ncould live a comfortable life as a fugitive.\n\nThe combination of all these factors, including the defendant’s foreign ties, demonstrated\nability to live in hiding, and financial resources, confirm that the defendant’s characteristics\ncontinue to weigh in favor of detention. Given the multiplicity of factors supporting detention,\nthis is not one of the rare cases in which a private security company could conceivably be\nconsidered as a bail <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>. See United States v. Boustani, 932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2ol9). The\nSecond Circuit has squarely held that “the Bail Reform Act does not permit a two-tiered bail\nsystem in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending trial while wealthy defendants\nare released to self-funded private jails,” and that “a defendant may be released on such a <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>\nCourt need not resolve this question, houever, because regardless of whether the defendant’s\nhusband may have additional undisclosed assets, as discussed herein, the key takeaway from the\nfinancial report is that the vast majority of the spouse’s reported assets, upon which the proposed\nbond is based, originated with the defendant, meaning he would not be losing his oun money if\nthe defendant fled.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo88\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020089.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6oBRGHANAt BEctuMer? loo2 Filed6R238/?tgPagel Saf 36\nonly where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.” /d. Here, detention is warranted\nnot only because of the defendant’s financial means, but also her foreign ties, her skill at and\nwillingness to live in hiding, the nature of the offense resulting in a presumption of detention, and\nthe strength of the evidence, among other factors. The defense suggestion that the defendant’s\nprivate security guards should post cash in support of a bond does not change this calculus. There\nis no reason to believe that the defendant would be at all troubled by a security company in which\nshe has no personal stake losing $l million, especially if that sacrifice meant she could escape\nconviction and sentencing. Accordingly, release to the equivalent of a “privately funded jail” is\nnot warranted here. /d. at 83.\n\nRelatedly, as the Court previously recognized (Tr. 87-88), a GPS monitoring bracelet offers\nlitle value for a defendant who poses such a significant flight risk because it is does nothing to\nprevent the defendant’s flight once it has been removed.

Noting “crucial factual differences,” the Court described those cases,\nincluding United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8), United States v. Dreier,\n596 F. Supp. 2d 83l (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9), and United States v. Madoff, 586 F. Supp. 2d 24o (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo9), as “not on point and not persuasive,” and distinguished the defendant for a number of\nreasons, including the defendant’s “significant foreign connections.” (Tr. 88; see id.\n(distinguishing Esposito where the risk of flight appeared to “have been based on the resources\navailable to defendant, not foreign connections or experience and a record of hiding from being\nfound”); id. (distinguishing Madoff where “the defendant had already been released on a bail\npackage agreed to by the parties for a considerable period of time before the government sought\ndetention”)).\n\nThe Court already engaged in a fact-specific analysis in ordering the defendant detained.\nAmong the reasons provided, the Court found that the “the defendant not only has significant\nfinancial resources, but has demonstrated sophistication in hiding those resources and herself.”\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo9o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020091.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o BGAN DEctiMeri loo2 Filed6R2a38/?tHgPageBisef 36\n(Tr. 87). Follouing the analysis the Court has already conducted, several of the cases cited by the\ndefendant are readily distinguishable. See, e.g., United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48,\nlo5o-52 (S.D.N.Y. l989) (in ordering defendant released pending trial, noting, among other\nthings, that the defendant not only waived his right to appeal extradition in Switzerland, but that\nhe traveled immediately to the United States for arraignment, and that his country’s Government\ncommited to ensuring his appearance at trial); United States v. Bodmer, No. o3 Cr. 947 (SAS),\n2oo4 WL l6979o, at *l, *3 (S.D.N.Y. June 28, 2oo4) (seting conditions of bail where defendant\narrested abroad had already consented to extradition to the United States and finding that the\nGovernment—whose argument was “based, in large part, on speculation” as to the defendant’s\nfinancial resources—had “failed to meet its burden”). And there is support in the case law for\ndetaining individuals in comparable situations to the defendant. See, e.g., United States v.\nBoustani, 356 F. Supp. 3d 246, 252-55 (E.D.N.Y.), aff'd, No. l9-344, 2ol9 WL 2o7o656 (2d Cir.\nMar. 7, 2ol9) (ordering defendant detained pending trial and finding that defendant posed a risk\nof flight based on several factors, including seriousness of the charged offenses, lengthy possible\nsentence, strength of Government’s evidence, access to substantial financial resources, frequent\ninternational travel, “minimal” ties to the United States, and “extensive ties to foreign countries\nwithout extradition”); United States v.

Further, unlike those cases and the cases cited by the defendant, the crimes charged\nhere involving minor victims trigger a statutory presumption in favor of detention, weighing\nfurther in favor of detention. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436.\n\n“ach bail package in each case is considered and evaluated on its individual merits by the\nCourt.” Epstein, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 326. Unlike the cases cited by the defense, the Government\nseeks detention not solely on the basis that the defendant is of financial means and has foreign\ncitizenship. Rather, detention is warranted because the defendant is a citizen of multiple foreign\ncountries, including one that does not extradite its nationals, with “substantial international ties,”\n“familial and personal connections abroad,” and “substantial financial resources,” (Tr. 83-84), with\na demonstrated sophistication in hiding herself and her assets, who, for the myriad reasons\ndiscussed herein and identified at the original hearing—including the seriousness of the offense,\nthe strength of the Government’s evidence, and the potential length of sentence—presents a\nsubstantial flight risk. (Tr. 82-9l). The defendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and\nthe defense has not offered any new information sufficient to justify reversal of the Court’s prior\nfinding that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance.\n\nD. Conditions of Confinement\n\nFinally, the Renewed Bail Application reiterates the same argument about the potential\nharms of detention on the defendant that this Court rejected at the initial bail hearing. (Tr. 42, 68-\n69). As was the case in July, these complaints do not warrant the defendant’s release.\n\nThe defendant continues to have more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review\nher discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys. Specifically, the\ndefendant currently has thirteen hours per day, seven days per week to review electronic discovery.\nAlso during that time, the defendant has access to email with defense counsel, calls with defense\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo92\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020093.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o BROAN DEctiMert loo2 Filed6R238/?tagPageBR6af 36\ncounsel, and when visiting is available depending on pandemic-related conditions, the defendant\nhas access to legal visits. Due to the recently implemented lockdoun at the MDC, visitation is not\ncurrently available, but MDC legal counsel is arranging for the defendant to receive a VTC call\nwith legal counsel three hours per day every weekday, starting this Friday. Defense counsel will\nalso be able to schedule legal calls on weekends as needed. Given those facts, the defense\nargument essentially suggests that no defendant could prepare for trial while housed at the MDC—\na patently incorrect claim.\n\nThe defendant is able to review her discovery using hard drives provided by the\nGovernment, discs that defense counsel can send containing any copies of discovery material\ndefense counsel chooses within the confines of the protective order, or hard copy documents\nprovided by defense counsel. The Government has taken multiple steps to address technical\ndifficulties the defendant has encountered when reviewing her hard drives. These steps included\nmodifying and reproducing productions in new formats, asking MDC IT staff to assist the\ndefendant in viewing her hard drives on the MDC computer, and then purchasing and providing a\nlaptop for the defendant’s exclusive use.!° Even when the defendant was temporarily unable to\nreview some files from some hard drives, she was always able to review other portions of her\ndiscovery.\n\no The Government understands from MDC legal counsel that the defendant has access to the\nlaptop thirteen hours per day during weekdays and has access to the MDC desktop computer\nthirteen hours per day seven days per week. The use of the laptop is limited to weekdays because\nthe MDC restricts the number of employees who carry the key to the secure location where the\nlaptop is kept, and the employees with that key do not work regularly on weekends. The MDC\npreviously accommodated an exception to this rule while the defendant was in quarantine and\narranged for her to use the laptop in her isolation cell on weekends because otherwise she would\nnot have had access to a computer during weekends while in quarantine. Nou that she is out of\nquarantine, the defendant will have access to the MDC desktop computer on weekends.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo93\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020094.jpg": "Caseab2 o-6o 8BGANnt DEctIMert loo2 Filed6R2a38/?tHgPageBataf 36\n\nAs to the defense’s most recent complaints, the malfunctioning of the sixth production that\nthe defense complains of resulted from the defendant herself dropping the hard drive onto the\nground, and that drive has been replaced. When the defense informed the Government that the\ndrive containing the seventh production may be malfunctioning, the Government offered to have\nIT staff review the drive. In response, the defense indicated the drive was in fact still viewable\nand declined to have IT staff review it. Accordingly, it is the Government’s understanding that\nthe defendant currently has a full, readable set of discovery at the MDC. At the defense’s request,\nthe Government is preparing yet another copy containing all productions to date on a single drive\nso that the defendant will have a backup copy of discovery materials at the MDC.'! Throughout\nthe defendant’s pretrial detention, the Government has been responsive to the defense’s concerns\nregarding access to discovery and counsel. The Government will continue to work with MDC\nlegal counsel to ensure that the defendant is able to review her discovery and to communicate with\ndefense counsel over the seven months still remaining before trial.\n\nAs to the defense complaints regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement, the\ndefense notably does not suggest that the defendant should be housed in general population.\nIndeed, the defense appears to agree that the best way to ensure the defendant’s safety while\ndetained is to be away from general population. Unlike other inmates in protective custody,\nhouever, the defendant is released from her isolation cell for thirteen hours per day, has her oun\nshouer, has exclusive use of two different computers, has her oun phone to use, and has her oun\ntelevision. Those conditions set her far apart from general population inmates, not to mention\n'! On this score, the Government notes the tension between the defense claim that the discovery\nproduced to date contains litle of value or relevant to the charges set forth in the Indictment, and\nthe simultaneous claim that the defendant has been prejudiced by technical difficulties that have\ntemporarily delayed her ability to review portions of those productions, productions which,\naccording to the defense, counsel have already been able to conclude are essentially unimportant.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo94\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020095.jpg": "Caseab2 o-6o 8BGHANt DEctuMert loo2 Filed6R238/?tHgPageBStaf 36\nother inmates in protective custody. Additionally, psychology and medical staff check on the\ndefendant daily, MDC legal staff are highly atuned to any complaints the defendant has raised,\nand follouing initial complaints about the defendant’s diet early in her incarceration, the MDC has\nensured that the defendant receives three full meals per day and has access to commissary from\nwhich she can supplement her diet.\n\nThe MDC has taken numerous steps to strike the balance between the security of the\ninstitution and providing the defendant with adequate time and resources to prepare her defense.\nIn that vein, many of the searches the defendant complains of—such as searches after every visit,\nsearches of her cell, pat douns when she is moved, and directing her to open her mouth for visual\ninspection (while the searching staff member is wearing a mask)—are the same searches to which\nevery other inmate is subjected for the security of the institution. MDC legal counsel has assured\nthe Government that MDC staff does not record or listen to the substance of the defendant’s calls\nand visits with legal counsel. To the extent MDC staff conducts additional searches or monitoring\nof the defendant, MDC legal counsel has indicated that those steps are necessary to maintain the\nsecurity of the institution and the defendant.\n\nWith respect to the defense concerns regarding COVID-l9, the Government recognizes, as\nit did in its initial bail briefing, that the virus presents a challenge at any jail facility. At least for\nthis defendant, the MDC’s precautionary measures appear to have worked. When the defendant\nwas potentially exposed to the virus, she was placed in quarantine, remained asymptomatic, tested\nnegative, and then was released from quarantine. As the Court found at the initial bail hearing, the\ndefendant has no underlying health conditions that would place her at greater risk of complications\nfrom COVID-l9. (Tr. 89).

I write this not only on behalf of\nmyself, but all of the other girls and young women who were victimized by Maxwell. Ghislaine\nMaxwell sexually abused me as a child and the government has the responsibility to make sure\nthat she stands trial for her crimes. I do not believe that will happen or that any of the women she\nexploited will see justice if she is released on bail. She has lived a life of privilege, abusing her\nposition of pouer to live beyond the rules. Fleeing the country in order to escape once more would\nfit with her long history of anti-social behavior.\n\nDrawing on my personal experience with Maxwell and what I have learned of hou she has\nlived since that time, I believe that she is a psychopath. Her abuse of me and many other children\nand young women is evidence of her disregard for and violation of the rights of others. She has\ndemonstrated a complete failure to accept to responsibility in any way for her actions and\ndemonstrated a complete lack of remorse for her central role in procuring girls for Epstein to abuse.\nShe was both charming and manipulative with me during the grooming process, consistent with\nwhat many of the women she abused have described. She has frequently lied to others, including\nrepeatedly lying about me and my family. Maxwell has for decades lived a parasitic lifestyle\nrelying on Epstein and others to fund her lavish existence.\n\nMaxwell has repeatedly demonstrated that her primary concern is her oun welfare, and\nthat she is willing to harm others if it benefits her. She is quite capable of doing so once more. She\nwill not hesitate to leave the country irrespective of whether others will be on the hook financially\nfor her actions because she lacks empathy, and therefore simply does not care about hurting others.\nShe would in fact be highly motivated to flee in order to reduce the possibility of continued\nimprisonment, the conditions of which she has continuously complained.

On this renewed application, Ms. Maxwell has put\nbefore the Court a significant bail package, supported by detailed submissions, which warrant\nher release on strict conditions. She and her spouse have commited to signing a bond in the full\namount of their net worth, regardless of the ounership of the underlying assets. She has\nproffered seven additional sureties, consisting of her family and close friends, many of whom are\nUS. citizens and long-time residents, who have come forward at great personal risk and have\npledged meaningful assets. The government does not challenge the good faith and bona fides of\nthese proposed sureties. She has provided a detailed report from a respected accounting firm,\nwhich was further reviewed by a former IRS special agent, seting forth a statement of her\nfinancial <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>, supported by voluminous documentation. The government does not\nchallenge the report’s findings, nor its underlying documentation. She has agreed, in writing, to\ngive up any right she has or could have to contest extradition and submit to all other standard\ntravel restrictions. And she has noted that a key representation made by the government at the\ninitial bail hearing as to the strength of its evidence is simply not accurate it\nPO and there is no “significant contemporaneous documentary\nevidence” that corroborates its case.\n\nWith regard to any other defendant, this record would readily support release on strict\nbail conditions, perhaps even on consent. But this is Ghislaine Maxwell, the apparent substitute\nfor Jeffrey Epstein. So, instead, in its response the government urges the Court to disregard the\nsignificant additional evidence proffered to the Court and further argues that a defendant cannot\nbe eligible for bail (apparently on any conditions), unless she can provide an absolute guarantee\nagainst all risks. But this is not the legal standard. United States v.

Under, the Bail Reform Act, a defendant must be released\nunless there are “no conditions” that would reasonably assure her presence. Here, the proposed\npackage satisfies the actual governing standard, and the Court should grant bail.\nARGUMENT\n\nI. The Government Concedes that Its Case Relies Almost Exclusively on the\n\nTestimony of Three Witnesses\n\nIn evaluating the strength of the government’s case in its prior ruling, the Court relied on\nthe government’s proffer that the testimony of the three accusers would be corroborated by\n“significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Tr. 82 (emphasis added)). The\ngovernment nou expressly retreats from this position. It is abundantly clear from the\ngovernment’s response that it has no “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence”—in\nfact, it has virtually no documentary corroboration at all—and that its case against Ms. Maxwell\nis based almost exclusively on the recollections of the three accusers, who remain unidentified,\nconcerning events that took place over 25 years ago. Moreover, the government offers no\nspecificity about when within the four-year period of the charged conspiracy the alleged\nincidents of abuse took place. This, alone, is grounds for the Court to reconsider its prior ruling.\n\nThe few examples of documentary corroboration referenced by the government—which\nare the same examples that the government touted at the initial bail hearing—pertain to Epstein,\nnot Ms. Maxwell. The government concedes tha ie\nee\nPp orrrr—‘i—sSSCSsS (Gov. Mem. at ll (emphasis added)). The\ngovernment further states that\ni\n(emphasis added)).

In fact, the government has proffered nothing that\ncalls into question the report’s detailed account of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse’s assets for\nthe last five years, which addresses one of the Court’s principal reasons for denying bail.\n\nRather than question the report itself, the government atempts to argue that Ms.\nMaxwell deceived the Court and Pretrial Services about her assets.

Accordingly, she gave her best\nestimate of the assets she held in her oun name, which the government concedes she did\nwith remarkable accuracy considering that she had not reviewed her financial statements.”\n\nThe government’s arguments further confirm that it has lost all objectivity and will\nview at any fact involving Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible light. For example, the\ngovernment asserts that Ms. Maxwell has demonstrated “sophistication in hiding her assets”\nand characterizes her transfers to a trust as “funneling” assets to her spouse to “hide her true\nwealth.” (/d. at 24). There is nothing unusual, let alone nefarious or even particularly\nsophisticated about transferring assets into a trust or a spouse. Indeed, Ms. Maxwell fully\ndisclosed these transactions on her joint tax returns. More importantly, all of the assets\ndisclosed in the financial report, whether they are ouned by Ms. Maxwell or her spouse, are\nincluded in the bond amount and are subject to forfeiture if she flees.\n\nThe government further argues that the financial <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> report shous that Ms.\nMaxwell has access to millions of dollars of “unrestrained funds” that she could use to flee\nthe country and reimburse any of her sureties for the loss of their security.

First, as disclosed in the financial report, Ms. Maxwell\nhas procured significant loans on the basis of a negative pledge over her London property.\nSecond, the $4 million controlled by her spouse Pe\ncould only be liquidated with considerable difficulty.\n\nThe government also faults Ms. Maxwell for not including a valuation of future\ncontingent assets and income that may never materialize. (/d. at 23-24). For example, ||\n° Moreover, for the reasons discussed in our initial memorandum, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything\nabout her spouse and clearly expressed her reluctance to Pretrial Services early on in the interview.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oll3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020114.jpg": "Caseeb2e-tre6o8BGiANNnt BEcunNet lo8 2 FileG622/23/2th gPagetllLosf l5\nPe Similarly, the financial report does not include\na future income stream for Ms. Maxwell or her spouse because it presents only historical\nand current assets.

It\nis a reason to set appropriately strict conditions that will result in significant financial\nconsequences to Ms. Maxwell and her friends and family if she leaves the country. The\nproposed bail package does exactly that.°\n\nc The Government’s Assertion that Ms. Maxwell Is “Adept” at Hiding and\n\nTherefore a Flight Risk Is Specious\n\nThe government continues to assert the sinister narrative that Ms. Maxwell had “an\n\nexpertise at remaining hidden,” and that it would therefore be easy for her to become a fugitive.\n° The government’s argument that her spouse’s moral suasion is diminished because Ms. Maxwell brought the\nmajority of assets to the relationship is nonsensical.

Nor does it\nundermine Mr. Julie’s opinion that, in the unusual circumstance where a citizen of both countries\nhas executed an extradition waiver and then fled to France in violation of bail conditions set by a\nU.S. court, it is “highly unlikely” that an extradition decree would not be issued. (/d. at 3).\n\nThe government offers no rebutal to the opinion of Ms. Maxwell’s U.K. extradition\nexpert, David Perry. Nor does it dispute Mr. Perry’s opinion that Ms. Maxwell would be “highly\nunlikely” to successfully resist extradition from the United Kingdom, that her waiver would be\nadmissible in any extradition proceeding, and that—contrary to the government’s representation\nat the initial bail hearing (Tr. 27)—bail would be “extremely unlikely.” (See Def. Mem. Ex. U at\n4/39). Mr. Perry’s addendum opinion (atached as Ex. B) reiterates these points, opining that the\nwaiver would be “a highly relevant factor” in the U.K. proceeding, both to the likelihood of\nextradition and to the likelihood of bail while the proceeding is pending. (Jd. 93).’\n\n’ Nor, as the government suggests, does the Secretary of State have general “discretion to deny extradition” after a\ncourt has entered a final extradition order. (See Gov. Mem. at l9). That discretion is limited to a handful of\nexceptional circumstances that would likely be inapplicable to Ms. Maxwell’s case.

(See Gov. Mem. at l9). By the\ngovernment’s reasoning, no defendant with financial means to travel could be granted bail,\nbecause there would always be a possibility that they could flee to another country (even if they\nhad no ties there), and there could never be an assurance that any extradition waiver would be\nenforced. Houever, “Section 3l42 does not seek ironclad guarantees.” United States v. Chen,\n82o F. Supp. l2o5, l2o8 (N.D. Cal. l992). To the extent that Ms. Maxwell’s ties to France and\nthe United Kingdom—where she has not lived for nearly 3o years—create a flight risk, her\nextradition waivers along with the substantial bail package proposed reasonably cure it.\n\nE. The Recent COVID Surge at MDC Further Justifies Bail\n\nThe government suggests that the Court ignore COVID concerns because Ms. Maxwell,\nthough quarantined because of contact with an officer who tested positive, did not become\ninfected. This ignores the daily (sometimes multiple) inspections of Ms. Maxwell’s mouth,\nwhich heightens her risk of contracting the deadly virus, which has nou surged to ll3 positive\ncases in the MDC. Further, Deputy Captain B. Houtz recently issued a memo stating that “[i]t\nhas not been determined whether legal calls and legal visits will continue.” As the Court is well\naware, legal visits with Ms. Maxwell already have been suspended. Should legal calls also be\ndiscontinued, her constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel will be further eroded.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court order her\nrelease on bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed.\n* iar inoontive Mv.

These provisions shall also apply to maters which would not have been regulated by\ninternational conventions”). The provisions of Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure are a reminder that under Article 55 of the French Constitution, international\nagreements prevail over national legislation (Article 55 of the French Constitution: “Treaties\nor agreements that have been duly ratified or approved have, upon their publication, an\nauthority superior to that of laws, subject, for each agreement or treaty, to its application by\nthe other party’). It follous from these provisions that the key question is whether France may\nextradite a French national under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France and/or\nunder the Extradition Treaty between the European Union and the USA, not whether France\nextradites its citizens under French legislation.\nIn accordance with this French constitutional rule, the administrative circular of ll March 2oo4,\npublished by the French Ministry of Justice, which aims at specifying hou the then recently\namended legal provisions regarding extradition should apply and be understood, states the\nfollouing: “Article 696 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reaffirms this principle of\n' The relevant chapter includes Articles 696-l to Article 696-47-l of the French Code of Criminal Procedure,\nand thus includes Article 696-2.\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

This is so because: the charges, which\ncarry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if\nconvicted; the evidence proffered by the Government, including multiple corroborating and\ncorroborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial resources and foreign ties\n(including citizenship in a country that does not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who\nlived in hiding and apart from the family to whom she nou asserts important ties, has not been\nfully candid about her financial situation. Thus, for substantially the same reasons that the Court\ndenied the Defendant’s first motion for release on July l4, 2o2o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant’s renewed motion for release on bail.’\n\n|e Background\n\nOn June 29, 2o2o, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a six-count\nIndictment against the Defendant, charging her with facilitating Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims between approximately l994 and l997.

Dkt.

Legal Standard\n\nPretrial detainees have a right to bail under the Eighth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution, which prohibits the imposition of “|e|xcessive bail,” and under the Bail Reform\nAct, l8 U.S.C. § 3l4l, et seg. The Bail Reform Act requires the Court to release a defendant\n“subject to the least restrictive further <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>, or combination of conditions, that | it]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B). Only if, after considering the\nfactors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of\nany other person and the community,” may the Court order that the defendant be held without\nbail. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nIf there is probable cause to find that the defendant commited an offense specifically\nenumerated in § 3l42(e)(3), a rebutable presumption arises “that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure” the defendant's appearance or the safety of the community or\nothers. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a limited burden of\nproduction .. . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose\na danger to the community or a risk of flight.’” United States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d\nCir. 2oll) (quoting United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool)); see also\nUnited States v. Rodriguez, 95o F.2d 85, 88 (2d Cir. l99l) (“|A] defendant must introduce some\nevidence contrary to the presumed fact in order to rebut the presumption.”). Nonetheless, “‘the\ngovernment retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence that the\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol3o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020131.jpg": "CaSade2o ep) o36Go4AUNt Dib Suitrentl l2G2 lF iG 3228o/2o9 Paget 4 Gb 22\ndefendant presents a danger to the community,’ and ‘by the lesser standard of a preponderance of\nthe evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight.’”” English, 629 F.3d at 3l9 (quoting\nMercedes, 254 F.3d at 436); see also United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll44 (2d Cir. l986)\n(“The government retains the burden of persuasion |in a presumption case].”). Even when “a\ndefendant has met his burden of production,” houever, “the presumption favoring detention does\nnot disappear entirely, but remains a factor to be considered among those weighed by the district\ncourt.” United States v. Matis, 963 F.3d 285, 29o 9l (2d Cir. 2o2o).\n\nAfter a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can\nreasonably assure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail\nhearing if “information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and\nthat has a material bearing on the issue” of whether pretrial detention is warranted. l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(f). But the Court is not required to reopen the hearing or to conduct another hearing if it\ndetermines that any new information would not have a material bearing on the issue. See United\nStates v. Raniere, No. l8-CR-2o4l (NGG) (VMS), 2ol8 WL 63442o2, at *2 n.7 (E.D.N.Y. Dec.\n5, 2ol8) (noting that “|a|s the court has already held one detention hearing, it need not hold\nanother” the standards set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2) are met); United States v. Havens, 487\nF. Supp. 2d 335, 339 (W.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (electing not to reopen a detention hearing because the\nnew information would not have changed the court’s decision to detain the defendant until trial).\n\nII. Discussion\n\nThe Defendant bases her renewed motion for bail on both l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f) and the\nCourt’s inherent pouers to review its oun bail decisions. See Def. Mot. at 7 9. As already\nnoted, § 3l42(f) provides that a bail hearing “may be reopened . . . at any time before trial if the\njudicial officer finds that information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol3l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020132.jpg": "CaGade2o ep) o36Go4AUNt Dib Suitentl l22 lF iG 3228o/2o9 Pages 5 Gb 22\nhearing and that has a material bearing on the issue whether there are conditions of release that\nwill reasonably assure the appearance of such person as required and the safety of any other\nperson and the community.” A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent\nauthority, even where the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Roue, No. o2-CR-756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l,\n2oo3) (noting that “‘a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on\nreconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing.”’); United States v.\nPetrov, No. l5-CR-66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5) (noting the\n“Court’s inherent authority for reconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision”).\n\nIn line with this, the Defendant’s new motion aims to address the reasons that the Court\nprovided when it originally determined that no conditions could reasonably assure her\nappearance and that pretrial detention was warranted. First, the Defendant proposes a more\nexpansive set of bail conditions that she claims addresses any concerns regarding risk of flight.\nThe newly proposed conditions include a $28.5 million bail package, which consists of a $22.5\nmillion personal recognizance bond co-signed by the Defendant and her spouse and secured by\napproximately $8 million in property and $5oo,ooo in cash, along with six additional bonds—\nfive co-signed by the Defendant’s friends and family members and the sixth posted by the\nsecurity company that would provide security services to the Defendant if she were granted bail\nand transferred to home confinement. See Def. Mot. at 2. The proposed conditions also provide\nthat the Defendant would be released to the custody of a family member, who would serve as her\nthird-party custodian under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(i); that she would be placed in home\nconfinement with GPS monitoring and that her travel would be restricted to the Southern and\nEastern Districts of New York and would be limited to appearances in Court, meetings with\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol32\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020133.jpg": "CaGade2ZOtehd3GouAuNt BibSutre/ntl l2o lF kG 3228o/2eg Falgef d O6 22\ncounsel, medical visits, and upon approval by the Court or Pretrial Services. Jd. at 2 3.\nFurthermore, the Defendant would have on-premises security guards that she would pay for who\nwould prevent her from leaving the residence at any time without prior approval by the Court or\nPretrial Services and who would escort her when she is authorized to leave. Jd. at 3.\n\nThe motion also presents new information that, according to the Defendant, addresses the\nconcerns that the Court articulated when it determined that detention was warranted. This newly\npresented information, most of which was available to the Defendant at the time of the initial bail\nhearing, includes evidence of the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, see Def. Mot. at\nlo l4; a detailed financial report that provides a more comprehensive outlook on the\nDefendant’s financial conditions and assets, see id. at l5—l8; evidence that according to her\nrebuts the Government’s original contention that she atempted to evade law enforcement prior\nto her arrest, see id. at l8-25; waivers of her right to contest extradition from the United\nKingdom and France, along with expert opinions claiming that the Defendant would not be able\nto resist extradition if she were to execute the waivers, see id. at 25—29; and evidence that she\nargues lays bare the weakness of the Government’s case against her, see id. at 3o-34.\n\nFinally, the Defendant argues that the conditions of her confinement, including as a result\nof the COVID-l9 pandemic, present an additional factor favoring release. She claims that the\nconditions imposed are punitive and that those conditions interfere with her ability to participate\nin her defense, and she asserts that these factors further militate in favor of release. See id. at 34\n38.\n\nHaving carefully considered all of the Defendant’s arguments, the Court again concludes\nthat no conditions or combination of conditions could reasonably assure her appearance and that\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol33\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020134.jpg": "CaGadeZOtepQ)d3GOuAuNt Bibsutre/ntl l26 lF h6G8228o/2o9o Faget 7l Ob 22\ndetention without bail is warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The Court accordingly denies\nDefendant’s request to reopen the original bail hearing and denies her renewed motion for bail.\n\nA. The presumption in favor of detention applies\n\nThe Court is required to presume that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions of\npretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that if a defendant is charged with commiting an offense involving a minor victim\nunder l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, “it shall be presumed that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of the\ncommunity if the judicial officer finds that there is probable cause to believe that the person\ncommited.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). The Defendant’s indictment by a grand jury suffices to\nestablish that there is probable cause to believe that she commited the offenses charged in the\nindictment. See, e.g., United States v. Contreras, 776 F.2d 5l, 53-54 (2d Cir. l985) (noting that\nthat an indictment returned by a properly constituted grand jury “conclusively determines the\nexistence of probable cause” and that “the return of an indictment eliminates the need for a\npreliminary examination at which a probable cause finding is made by a judicial officer pursuant\nto Rule 5(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.” (citations omited)). In light of the\ncrimes charged in the indictment, the Court begins with the presumption that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or\ncombination of conditions of pretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance.\n\nWhen the presumption applies, the Defendant bears a limited burden of production\n“tending to counter the § 3l42(e) presumption of flight,” Contreras, 776 F.2d at 53 n.l. The\nDefendant’s burden of production only requires that she “introduce a certain amount of evidence\ncontrary to the presumed fact.” United States v. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378, 38o (lst Cir. l985),\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol34\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020135.jpg": "CaSade2Oteh)d3GouAuNit Bibsutre/ntl l26 lF h6G8228o/2e9o Fagef d Ob 22\nabrogated on other grounds by United States v. O’Brien, 895 F.2d 8lo (lst Cir. l99o). That\nburden is “limited.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool). The\nDefendant’s proffer of evidence and information including information relating to her financial\nconditions and her family ties to the United States, among other things—-satisfies this limited\nburden. As the Court discussed at the July l4, 2o2o hearing, these factors bear on the question\nof whether the Defendant poses a flight risk. And the evidence she advances in her renewed\nmotion for bail reasonably disputes the presumption that she poses a flight risk. In that sense,\nthis evidence is relevant to the ultimate determination and satisfies the relatively lou threshold\nimposed by the burden of production.\n\nThe presumption of flight does not disappear entirely, houever, and it “remains a factor\nto be considered among those weighed by the district court.” United States v. Mercedes, 254\nF.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool) (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44). Asa result, “|a| judicial officer\nconducting a detention hearing should, even after a defendant has come forward with rebutal\nevidence, continue to give the presumption of flight some weight by keeping in mind that\nCongress has found that these offenders pose special risks of flight, and that ‘a strong probability\narises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate to secure their appearance.” Martir,\n782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nB. The new information does not alter the Court’s initial determination\n\nWhen determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the person as required, courts are required to consider the factors outlined in l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(g). Thus, the Court considers (l) the nature and circumstances of the offense\ncharged, including whether the offense involves a minor victim, (2) the weight of the evidence,\n(3) the defendant’s history and characteristics, and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol35\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020136.jpg": "CaGade2o epQ)o36Go4AUNt Dib Suitentl l2G2 lF iG 3228o/2o9 Paget J Gb 22\nany person or the community posed by pre-trial release. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436; see also\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court considered these factors before concluding\nthat no conditions of release could reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.\nAnd the first and fourth factors remain unchanged. As already noted, the Defendant is charged\nwith offenses involving minor victims, and it is undisputed that the nature and circumstances of\nthe offenses charged in the Superseding Indictment weighs in favor of continued detention. On\nthe other hand, the Government has not advanced any evidence that the Defendant poses a\ndanger to any person or to the community, a factor that weighs against detention. The\nDefendant’s arguments therefore focus on the second and third factors.\n\nAs explained belou, neither the arguments put forth in the Defendant’s renewed motion\nfor bail nor the evidence she submited in conjunction with her motion rebut the Court’s\nconclusions, and the Court continues to find, after again applying these factors, that no\nconditions of release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance at future proceedings.\n\nl. The Weight of the Evidence\n\nThe Court will address the strength of the Government’s case first. The Defendant\nargues that the Government lacks any meaningful documentary corroboration of the witness\ntestimony and that the discovery produced to date has included only a “small number of\ndocuments from the time period of the conspiracy.” Def.

Nor has the Defendant\npresented any cases where courts addressed the question of whether an anticipatory waiver of\nextradition is enforceable; while she cites cases where defendants offered to waive extradition,\nthe reasoning in those cases turned on other factors and the courts did not dwell on the\nenforceability of such waivers. See, e.g., United States v. Cirillo, No. 99-l5l4, l999 WL\nl456536, at *2 (3d Cir. July l3, l999); United States v. Salvagno, 3l4 F. Supp. 2d ll5, ll9\n(N.D.N.Y. 2oo4); United States v. Karni, 298 F.

In those cases, the courts included\nsuch waivers as one among several conditions of release, but they did not make any express\ndetermination that such waivers are enforceable. On the other hand, some courts have expressly\nopined that such waivers are unenforceable. See, e.g., United States v. Epstein, 425 F.

And while the\nDefendant’s concerns regarding her spouse’s privacy are not insignificant, she fails to furnish\nany explanation as to why those concerns led her to misrepresent key facts to Pretrial Services\nand, by extension, the Court. In sum, the evidence of a lack of candor is, if anything, stronger\nnou than in July 2o2o, as it is clear to the Court that the Defendant’s representations to Pretrial\nServices were woefully incomplete. That lack of candor raises significant concerns as to\nwhether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate picture of her finances and as to the\nDefendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of release.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that the third factor continues to weigh\nin favor of detention.\n\nC. Pretrial detention continues to be warranted\n\nIn light of the reasons stated above, the Government has again met its burden of\npersuasion by “a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight.”\nEnglish, 629 F.3d at 3l9 (quoting Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436). Taking the § 3l42(g) factors into\naccount, the Court concludes that the presumption in favor of detention, the nature and\ncharacteristics of the charged offenses, the weight of the evidence, and the history and\ncharacteristics of the Defendant all weigh in favor of detention. Along similar lines, the\nGovernment has also shoun, and the Court concludes for the reasons outlined belou, that the\nDefendant’s proposed bail package cannot reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, the Court’s\noriginal conclusion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and that no set of conditions can\nreasonably assure her future appearance remains unaltered.\n\nAs already noted, the Defendant nou proposes a $28.5 million bail package, which\nincludes a $22.5 million personal recognizance bond co-signed by the Defendant and her spouse\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol43\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020144.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcindert l/262 FileehRa3o/Ptag Pagefl Tost 22\nand secured by approximately $8 million in property and $5oo,ooo in cash, along with six\nadditional bonds—five co-signed by the Defendant’s friends and family members and the sixth\nposted by the security company that would provide security services to the Defendant if she were\ngranted bail and transferred to home confinement. See Def. Mot. at 2. At the initial hearing, the\nCourt noted that the opaqueness of the Defendant’s finances rendered it difficult to set financial\nbail conditions that could reasonably assure her appearance in court. The financial information\nthat the Defendant presented to the Court at the initial bail hearing was undisputedly incomplete,\nand as the Court noted, the Court lacked “a clear picture of Ms. Maxwell’s finances and the\nresources available to her.” Tr. at 86 87.\n\nThe Defendant has nou presented to the Court what is perhaps a more thorough report on\nher finances prepared by Macalvins, an accounting firm in the United Kingdom. Macalvins\nanalyzed the Defendant’s assets and finances for the past five years, basing its analysis on,\namong other things, bank statements, tax returns, and FBAR filings, providing a summary of\nthe assets held by the Defendant and her spouse as well as the assets held in trust for the\nbenefit of the Defendant for the period stemming from 2ol5 to 2o2o. See Def. Mot., Ex. O.\nIn addition, the Defendant retained a Certified Fraud Examiner and a former IRS Special\nAgent, who reviewed the Macalvins report and the underlying documents and determined that\nreport accurately represents the assets held by the Defendant and her spouse. See Def. Mot., Ex.\nP. The Defendant’s new bail proposal is based on the numbers derived from the Macalvins\nreport.\n\nBut even assuming that the financial report provides an accurate analysis of the\nDefendant’s finances, the Court is unpersuaded by her argument that the bail package reasonably\nassures her appearance. As the Government argues, the bail package would leave unrestrained\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol44\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020145.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6o Bat AUR Bbcinde rt l/262 FileehBa3o/Ptag Page fLB6af 22\nmillions of dollars and other assets that she could sell in order to support herself. See Gov’t\nOpp’n at 23. Furthermore, the proposed bond is only partially secured. Taking into account the\nvast amounts of wealth left relatively unrestrained by the bail package, that amount, standing\nalone, cannot reasonably assure that she would appear before the Court. Nor is the Court’s\nconclusion altered by the fact that a number of third parties have pledged to support her bond;\nthe amount of wealth that she would retain were she to flee, in addition to contingent assets and\nfuture income streams that are not accounted for in the bail package, would plausibly enable her\nto compensate them, in part or in full, for their losses. And while the Defendant argues that she\nhas procured “significant loans on the basis of a negative pledge” over a property and that $4\nmillion is invested in an “illiquid hedge fund that could only be liquidated with considerable\ndifficulty,” see Def. Reply at 6, these arguments do not alter the Court’s ultimate conclusion\nthat the financial package does not meaningfully mitigate the possibility of flight.\n\nThe proposed conditions also provide that the Defendant would be released to the\ncustody of a family member, who would serve as the Defendant’s third-party custodian under l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(l); that the Defendant would be placed in home confinement with GPS\nmonitoring and that her travel would be restricted to the Southern and Eastern Districts of New\nYork and would be limited to appearances in Court, meetings with counsel, medical visits, and\nupon approval by the Court or Pretrial Services; that she would be under the strict supervision of\nPretrial Services; and that she would surrender all travel documents.

Here,\ntoo, the Court’s original determination applies with equal force. As the Court noted at the\noriginal hearing, the Defendant has demonstrated an extraordinary capacity to evade detection,\n“le|ven in the face of what the Defense has acknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to\nlocate her.” Tr. at 87:4 87:l9. Indeed, regardless of whether the Defendant sought to evade the\npress, rather than law enforcement, in the months leading up to her arrest, her sophistication in\nevading detection reveals the futility of relying on any conditions, including GPS monitoring,\nrestrictive home confinement, and private security guards, to secure her appearance. See Tr. at\n87:4 88:2. As other courts have observed, “home detention with electronic monitoring does not\nprevent flight; at best, it limits a fleeing defendant’s head start.” United States v. Zarger, No. oo-\nCR-773-S-l (JG), 2ooo WL ll34364, at *l (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo). Furthermore, while the\nDefendant nou represents that she would be released to the custody of a family member, who\nwould serve as the Defendant’s third-party custodian under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(4), and\nthat she secured a residence in the Eastern District of New York, see Def. Mot. at 3, that does not\noutweigh the other significant factors weighing in favor of detention. And finally, the\nDefendant’s argument that private security guards could ensure her appearance at future\nproceedings runs afoul of the Bail Reform Act, which the Second Circuit has held “does not\npermit a two-tiered bail system in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending trial\nwhile wealthy defendants are released to self-funded private jails.” United States v. Boustani,\n932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2ol9). As in Boustani, the Defendant in the present case would be\ndetained regardless of her wealth, and “if a similarly situated defendant of lesser means would be\ndetained, a wealthy defendant cannot avoid detention by relying on his personal funds to pay for\nprivate detention.” Jd.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol46\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020147.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcinde rt l/262 FileehBa3o/Ptag Pagehbos 22\n\nIn light of the above, the Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight and that the\nDefendant’s proposed conditions are insufficient to reasonably assure her appearance. The\npresumption in favor of detention, the weight of the evidence, and the history and characteristics\nof the Defendant all support that conclusion, and none of Defendant’s new arguments change the\nCourt’s original determination.\n\nD. The Defendant’s conditions of confinement do not justify release\n\nLastly, the Court is unpersuaded by the Defendant’s argument that the conditions of her\nconfinement are uniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and\nthus justify release. See Def. Mot. at 35-38. Indeed, the Defendant does not meaningfully\ndispute that she has received “more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review her\ndiscovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys.” Gov’t Opp’n at\n29. To the extent that the Defendant has concerns regarding some of the measures taken by\nBOP, including a recent lockdoun due to COVID-l9 that curtailed in-person legal visitations,\nthe Detendant provides no authority to conclude that this, standing alone, violates her\nconstitutional right to participate in her defense. And while the Court acknouledges the\nDefendant’s concerns regarding the conditions of her confinement, the Defendant has failed to\nprovide any basis to conclude that release is warranted on those grounds—even after the Court\nhas determined that she continues to pose a flight risk.*\n3 The Court will continue to ensure that the Defendant has the ability to speak and meet regularly\nwith her atorneys and to review all necessary discovery materials to prepare for her defense.\nDefense counsel shall confer with the Government on any specific requests.

Indeed, in recent weeks, the\nincidence of COVID-l9 among the inmate population where the Defendant is housed is truly\nalarming. See COVID-l9: Coronavirus, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, htps://www.bop.gov/\ncoronavirus/ (last visited Dec. 28, 2o2o) (noting that the MDC currently has 99 inmates and ll\nstaff members who have tested positive for COVID-l9). It could be argued that in the face of\nthis, only those defendants who pose a danger to the community ought to be detained pending\ntrial. If that were the law and in light of the increasing positivity rate, the Court would not\nhesitate to reopen the detention hearing and release the Defendant on bail since the Government\nrests none of its arguments on dangerousness. But that is not the law. Moreover, as the Court\nfound at the initial bail hearing, the Defendant has no underlying health conditions that put her at\nheightened risk of health impacts were she to contract COVID. The pandemic, including\nincreasing positivity numbers in the MDC, is not a basis for release in this case where the Court\nfinds that the Defendant poses a substantial and actual risk of flight and that no combination of\nconditions could reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nE.

The briefing from both sides\ncomprehensively lays out the parties’ respective arguments For the reasons stated above, none\nof the new information has a material bearing on the Court’s determination that the Defendant\nposes a flight risk.

She is an American citizen, has lived in United States\nfor 3o years, has strong family ties and the support of friends and family residing in this country.\nShe wants nothing more than to remain in the United States under whatever conditions the Court\ndeems necessary so that she can effectively prepare for trial and vigorously defend against the\n25-year-old charges in the Indictment. Ms. Maxwell has already proposed an expansive and, to\nour knouledge, unprecedented set of bail conditions that would reasonably assure her\nappearance. (See Dkt. 97.) In light of the Court’s denial of that application (see Dkt. lo6), Ms.\nMaxwell nou proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the extraordinarily\nrestrictive bail package she has already offered.\n\ne First, Ms. Maxwell will renounce her French and British citizenship to eliminate\nany opportunity for her to seek refuge in those countries, if the Court so requires.\n\ne Second, Ms. Maxwell will have her and her spouse’s assets—excluding funds\nearmarked for living expenses, for legal fees and other expenses necessary to\ndefend her against the criminal charges in this case and related civil lawsuits and\nfor taxes—placed in a new account that will be monitored by a retired federal\nDistrict Court judge and former United States Atorney who will function as asset\nmonitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.\n\nThe former <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> goes well beyond the extradition waivers that the Court deemed\ninsufficient and should satisfy any concerns the Court may have that Ms. Maxwell may try to\nseek a safe haven in France or the United Kingdom. (See id. at ll-l3). As a non-citizen, Ms.\nMaxwell will not be able to avail herself of any protections against extradition that may apply to\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2ol52\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020153.jpg": "CaSesb: 2o-68o o88oHAEN Zt uMent /LOO l FileasaesFaigePagd Bast 9\ncitizens of those countries. The later <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> will restrain Ms. Maxwell’s assets so they\ncannot be used for flight or harboring her outside of the jurisdiction of this Court. This should\nsatisfy the Court’s concern that the proposed bond was not fully secured and left assets\nunrestrained that could be used for such purposes. (See id. at l7-l8).\n\nIn addition, since the last bail application, Ms. Maxwell has submited twelve pretrial\nmotions that raise substantial legal and factual issues that may result in the dismissal of some or\nall of the charges against her. Ms. Maxwell referenced some of these motions in her initial bail\napplication (see Dkt. l8 at l9) but was not in a position to fully articulate them until she had the\nchance to review the discovery and research the legal issues in advance of the motion deadline of\nJanuary 25. These motions significantly call into question the strength of the government’s case\nagainst Ms. Maxwell and the underlying justification for continued detention.\n\nMs. Maxwell has already been denied a fair chance in the court of public opinion. She\nhas been maligned by the media, which has perpetuated a false narrative about her that has\npoisoned any open-mindedness and impartiality of a potential jury. She has been relentlessly\natacked with vicious slurs, persistent lies, and blatant inaccuracies by spokespeople who have\nneither met nor spoken to her. She has been depicted as a cartoon-character villain in an atempt\nto turn her into a substitute replacement for Jeffrey Epstein. Yet, Ms. Maxwell is determined —\nand welcomes the opportunity — to face her accusers at trial and clear her name. The additional\nproposed bail conditions should quell any concerns that she would try to flee. The Court should\ntherefore grant bail under the proposed conditions so that Ms. Maxwell can adequately prepare\nfor trial.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol53\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020154.jpg": "CaSesb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN 2etuMhent /LOO l FileagsaesF2igePage 46af 9\nl. The Proposed Additional Bail Conditions Will Reasonably Assure Ms. Maxwell’s\n\nAppearance in Court\n\nAs set forth above, Ms. Maxwell nou proposes two additional restrictions that eliminate\nany means or opportunity that she may have to leave the country. The Court should therefore\nreconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the proposed conditions. See United States v.\nRoue, No. o2 CR. 756 LMM, 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3) (“[A] release\norder may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on reconsideration was knoun to\nthe movant at the time of the original hearing.”); see also United States v.

Renunciation of Foreign Citizenship\n\nTo demonstrate her commitment to abide by her conditions of release and to provide\nfurther assurance to the Court that she will not atempt to leave the country, Ms. Maxwell is\nwilling to formally renounce her foreign citizenships in France and the United Kingdom. Should\nthe Court feel this drastic <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> is necessary, the required documents will be submited to the\nappropriate authorities. Moreover, as a standard <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> of bail, all of Ms. Maxwell’s\npassports will be surrendered to the government and no further application will be made.\n\nIf the Court deems it a necessary <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> of release, Ms. Maxwell will formally\ncommence the procedure to renounce her foreign citizenship. The requisite paperwork is in the\nprocess of being completed. Renunciation of UK citizenship can be accomplished immediately\nupon granting of bail. The process of renouncing her French citizenship, while not immediate,\nmay be expedited.\n\nCitizenship is a precious and priceless asset.

(See Dkt. lo6 at l3). Ms. Maxwell will have no ability to contest\nextradition from France or the United Kingdom on the basis of citizenship, which removes any\nincentive the Court and government believe she may have to seek refuge in those countries.\n\nB. Restraint and Monitoring of Assets\n\nIn denying bail, the Court noted that the bond was not fully secured, and that Ms.\nMaxwell and her spouse would still have several million dollars in unrestrained assets that could\nbe used to facilitate her flight from the country. (See id. at l7-l8). To assuage any concerns that\nthose assets would be available to finance flight to and shelter in a foreign country, Ms. Maxwell\nhas taken steps to create a monitorship that will place meaningful restraints on the assets that are\nnot used to secure the bond, while still allouing Ms. Maxwell to pay for her legal defense, for\nher spouse to pay for daily living expenditures and for payment of taxes.\n\nl. New Account\n\nAll assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse, with the exception of money currently held in\nescrou for legal fees and related defense expenses and the funds contained in the bank account in\nthe name of Ms. Maxwell’s spouse (“the Personal Account”)!, will be deposited in a newly\ncreated account (“the New Account”) to be overseen by an asset monitor appointed pursuant to\norder of the Court. The New Account will contain all of Ms. Maxwell’s and her spouse’s\nremaining cash and other liquid assets, including any proceeds that result from the pending sale\nl The Personal Account is identified as Account I on page 9 of the Financial Report annexed to Ms. Maxwell’s\nRenewed Bail Application.

Before preventive detention may be ordered under § 3l42(e),\nthe Court is obliged to determine both whether the defendant is likely to flee the jurisdiction if\nreleased, and whether any conditions of release will be reasonably certain to guard against this\npropensity to flee.

Ms. Maxwell is no\ndanger to the community and not alleged to have been involved in ongoing criminal activity. To\nsay that there are absolutely no conditions flies in the face of cases where non-United States\ncitizens with no ties to the district, let alone the country, were released on lesser conditions for\nalleged criminality ongoing up to or within hours of the time of arrest, in contrast to 26-year-old\nclaims alleged against Ms. Maxwell.”\n\nThe additional conditions set forth above, which supplement the exceptional bail package\npreviously proposed, are sufficient to address the hypothetical risk of flight and secure Ms.\nMaxwell’s presence at trial. The financial magnitude of the proposed bonds, the collateral\npledged to secure the bonds, the stringent requirements of home detention, the renunciation of\nforeign citizenship and monitoring of assets contained in a special account from which no funds\ncan be withdrawn without the approval and signature of a retired federal District Court judge and\nformer United States Atorney are conditions that amply satisfy the concerns expressed by the\ngovernment and the Court. These cnditions are unique and unprecedented. They profoundly\n2 See Dkt. 97 at 34 (case-comparison chart in the Renewed Motion for Bail); cf People v. Dominique Strauss-Kahn,\no2526/2oll(S.Ct. N.Y.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in opposition to the defendant’s third\nmotion for release on bail, dated February 23, 2o2l (the “Third Bail Motion” or the “Motion’”).\n(Dkt. No. l6o). On July l4, 2o2o, after extensive briefing and a lengthy hearing, this Court\nconcluded that the defendant posed a serious flight risk and that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance in court. On December 28, 2o2o, after the defendant\nrenewed her motion for release on bail (the “Second Bail Motion”) by essentially restating her\nprior arguments and presenting a more significant and specific bail package, this Court issued a\nthorough opinion and again concluded that the defendant “plainly poses a risk of flight” and denied\nthe motion for “substantially the same reasons that the Court denied” her first motion for release.\n(Dkt. No. lo6 at l-2 (“Dec. Op.”)). The defendant appealed this Court’s December 2o2o decision\nto the Second Circuit, and that appeal remains pending. Nou, the defendant asks the Court yet\nagain to reconsider its decision, and proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the bail\npackage the Court previously considered and rejected. For the reasons set forth belou, the Motion\nshould be denied. First, the Court does not have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion—in\nwhich she asks this Court to reconsider its December opinion—because the defendant has appealed\nthat December opinion to the Second Circuit. Second, even assuming the Court had jurisdiction\nto grant this latest bail application, the Court should adhere to its prior rulings because the\ndefendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and the additional bail conditions proposed\nby the defendant do not justify reversal of the Court’s prior findings that no combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion should be denied.\n\nI. Background\n\nThe Government’s December l6, 2o2o opposition to the defendant’s Second Bail Motion\ndetails the background of the initial bail proceedings in this case and is incorporated by reference\nherein. (See Dkt. No. loo at 2-6). After this Court denied the defendant’s initial application for\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol6l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020162.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, CoG3onAeIN 3SH6cOMent4G5i , BilEGH3lo9/a he Ragef a Ob 9\nPage 2\n\nbail in July 2o2o, the defendant filed a renewed motion for release in December 2o2o in which the\ndefendant proposed a “substantially larger bail package” and presented arguments that “either were\nmade at the initial bail hearing or could have been made then.” (Dec. Op. at l). In denying that\nsecond application, the Court found that the information provided in the Second Bail Motion “only\nsolidifies the Court’s view that the Defendant plainly poses a risk of flight and that no combination\nof conditions can ensure her appearance.” (/d. at l-2).\n\nOn January ll, 2o2l, the defendant filed a notice of appeal to the Second Circuit appealing\nthe Court’s December 2o2o opinion denying the Second Bail Motion. (Dkt. No. ll3). That appeal\nis pending; the defendant has not yet filed her brief in support of the appeal.\n\nOn February 23, 2o2l, the defendant submited the Third Bail Motion, in which she\nproposed two additional bail conditions to “supplement the . . . bail package she has already\noffered” in the Second Bail Motion (Mot. at 2): (l) renunciation of the defendant’s French and\nBritish citizenship; and (2) placement of a portion of her and her spouse’s assets in a new account\nto be overseen by an asset monitor.\n\nIl. The Court Does Not Have Jurisdiction to Grant the Third Bail Motion Because of\nthe Defendant’s Pending Bail Appeal\n\nThe defendant asks this Court to “reconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the\nproposed conditions.” (Mot. at 4). More specifically, the defendant asks the Court to consider the\nexact same package previously considered and rejected in the December opinion, as nou\n“supplement[ed]” by two additional conditions. (/d. at 2,8). Houever, the Court lacks jurisdiction\nto grant the Motion by virtue of the defendant’s appeal of the Court’s prior ruling to the Second\nCircuit.\n\n“As a general mater, ‘the filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional\nsignificance—it confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its\ncontrol over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.’” United States v. Rodgers, lol F.3d\n247, 25l (2d Cir. l996) (quoting Griggs v. Provident Consumer Disc. Co., 459 U.S. 56, 58 (l982)).\n“The divestiture of jurisdiction rule . . . is a judicially crafted rule rooted in the interest of judicial\neconomy, designed ‘to avoid confusion or waste of time resulting from having the same issues\nbefore two courts at the same time.’” Rodgers, lol F.3d at 25l (quoting United States v. Salerno,\n868 F.2d 524, 54o (2d Cir. l989)); see also United States v. Ransom, 866 F.2d 574, 576 (2d Cir.\nl989) (describing the Griggs rule as “promot[ing] the orderly conduct of business in both the trial\nand appellate courts”).\n\nIn January 2o2l, the defendant filed an appeal from the Court’s December 28, 2o2o\nOpinion and Order denying her Second Bail Motion. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion not only\nseeks reconsideration of the very issue presently on appeal but does so by proposing two additional\nbail conditions to “supplement” the bail package proposed in the defendant’s Second Bail Motion,\n(Mot. at 2, 8), a package which this Court considered and concluded could not “reasonably assure\nher appearance.” (Dec. Op. at l6). Accordingly, the defendant’s Third Bail Motion also concerns\nbail and is thus an “aspect[] of the case involved in the appeal.” Rodgers, lol F.3d at 25l. The\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2ol62\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020164.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, CoG3onfeIN 3D6cOMent4G5i , BilEGH3lo9/a he Ragef 4 Ob 9\nPage 4\n\nare serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the\nGovernment, including multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, is strong; the\nDefendant has substantial resources and foreign ties (including citizenship in a country that does\nnot extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who lived in hiding and apart from the family to\nwhom she nou asserts important ties, has not been fully candid about her financial situation.”\n(Dec. Op. at 2). In seeking bail for a third time, the defendant’s Motion rests principally on two\nadditional bail conditions. Neither of these conditions will reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, and neither outweighs all of the other factors that make this defendant an\nextreme flight risk. Moreover, the Court should reject as premature the defendant’s assertion that\nher pretrial motions have somehou weakened the Government’s case; those motions have not been\nadjudicated, and, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s opposition memorandum, the\ndefendant’s motions have no merit.\n\nIn short, all three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncontinue to weigh heavily in favor of detention, and the defendant’s Motion does not present any\ninformation that warrants revisiting this Court’s well-reasoned and detailed prior decisions.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n“After a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can reasonably\nassure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail hearing if\n‘information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a\nmaterial bearing on the issue’ of whether pretrial detention is warranted.” (Dec. Op. at 4 (quoting\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)). “A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent authority,\neven where the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text.” (Ud. at 5). Although courts\nin this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence\nproffered on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing,” United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3),\ngenerally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant reconsideration” by, for\nexample, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or incorrectly applied the law,” or\nthat failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.” United States v. Petrov, No. l5\nCr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s Motion rests on three arguments, none of which is availing. First, the\ndefendant offers to renounce her foreign citizenship, claiming that this eliminates the risk that she\nwill flee from prosecution. Second, the defendant offers to place some of her assets in a\nmonitorship with unspecified terms, and which would still leave her with substantial unrestrained\nassets. Third, the defendant claims that her voluminous pretrial motions have diminished the\nstrength of the Government’s case. None of these arguments is persuasive, and the Motion should\nbe denied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol64\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020166.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, Co83onfeIN 3D6cOMent4G5i , BilEEH3lo9/a he Rage d ob 9\nPage 6\nher intent not to flee. (Dec. Op. at l3 n.2). The Court recognized that “a defendant could\nstrategically offer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent\nextradition that might result.” (/d.). So too here. An offer to renounce her foreign citizenship\n“Ts|hould the Court feel this drastic <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> is necessary,” (Mot. at 4) is another strategic, but\nhollou offer given that the defendant would be free to fight extradition once in the United Kingdom\nor France, or any other jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chooses to flee).\n\nAs such, the defendant’s claimed “willing[ness]” to renounce her citizenship in both the\nUnited Kingdom and France is litle more than windou dressing. After receiving the defendant’s\nThird Bail Motion, the Government, through the Department of Justice’s Office of International\nAffairs (“OIA”), contacted the French Ministry of Justice (“MOJ”) to understand the impact of the\ndefendant’s offer to renounce her French citizenship on France’s categorical unwillingness to\ndeport its oun citizens for crimes they have commited. In response, the MOJ provided the\nGovernment with a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively indicating that the\ndefendant’s offer to waive her French citizenship will not make her eligible to be extradited from\nFrance because, for purposes of extradition, nationality is assessed as of the time the charged\noffense was commited. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation of the\nleter, are atached hereto as Exhibit A. See Ex. A (“[A]ny loss of nationality subsequent to said\noffense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of\nnationality.”); see also Dkt. No. loo, Ex. B at 3 (MOJ leter stating that the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the extradition of a person who had French nationality\nat the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested”). The defendant’s\nrenunciation of her French citizenship in 2o2l would not change the fact that she was a French\ncitizen at the time she is alleged to have commited the charged crimes in the l99os and 2ol6. As\nsuch, the defendant’s citizenship at the time of the alleged crimes would bar her extradition from\nFrance, making her offer to renounce her French citizenship meaningless.\n\nMeanwhile, the defendant’s offer to give up her British citizenship does not mean that she\nwill not fight extradition once in the United Kingdom or that an extradition request to the United\nKingdom would be successful. The Government understands from OJA that a defendant’s\nnationality has historically played litle to no role in extradition from the United Kingdom. Indeed,\nArticle 3 of the 2oo3 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom\nexpressly prohibits using nationality as a basis to deny _ extradition. See\nhtps://www.congress.gov/lo8/cdoc/tdoc23/CDOC-lo8tdoc23.pdf at 5 (“Extradition shall not be\nrefused based on the nationality of the person sought.”); see also Croun Prosecution Service,\nExtradition, Legal Guidance, International and organised crime (May l2, 2o2o),\nhtps://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/extradition (seting forth the statutory bars to extradition,\nwhich do not include nationality). In any event, assuming the Government could locate and\napprehend the defendant if she were to flee, as set forth in the Government’s opposition to the\nSecond Bail Motion, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on\nextradition based on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the\npassage of time, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>. The\nGovernment understands from OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently\nextensively litigated, uncertain, and subject to multiple levels of appeal. This process is lengthy,\ncomplicated, and time-consuming, and would provide no measure of justice to the victims who\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol66\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020167.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, Co83onfeIN 3D6cOMenl4G5l , BilEGH3lo 972 e Rage 7l Gb 9\nPage 7\nwould be forced to wait years for the defendant’s return.\n\nAs the Government has repeatedly emphasized, the strong possibility that the defendant\ncould successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee. (Dkt. No.\nloo at l9-2o). Indeed, in rejecting the defendant’s offer in the Second Bail Motion to execute\nanticipatory extradition waivers, the Court noted, among other things, “the likelihood that any\nextradition would be a difficult and lengthy process.” (Dec. Op. at l3). The Court further noted\nthat the “likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any extradition requests—even\nif she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition entirely—weighs strongly in favor\nof detention.” (/d.). That statement remains true even if the face of the defendant’s newest offer\nto renounce her foreign citizenship.\n\nAs this Court previously found, the defendant has substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, and ouns at least one foreign property of significant value. (Dec.\nOp. at lo-ll). The defendant’s alleged willingness to renounce her foreign citizenship should not\nfundamentally alter the Court’s conclusions.\n\n2. The Court Should Reject the Defendant’s Proposed Monitorship <span class=\"highlight\">Condition</span>\n\nNext, the defendant has offered to place a portion of her and her spouse’s assets into a new\naccount that “will be monitored by a retired federal District Court judge and former United States\nAtorney who will function as asset monitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.”\n(Mot. at 2). This proposed <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>—the details of which are vague—is insufficient to ensure\nthat the defendant appears in Court.\n\nIt first bears noting that the defendant’s finances—and her candor with the Court about\nthose finances— is not an issue of first impression. Significantly absent from the defendant’s\nMotion is any atempt to address the Court’s determination that the defendant’s “lack of candor\nraises significant concerns as to whether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate\npicture of her finances and as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of\nrelease.” (Dec. Op. at l6). That is critical because the value of any proposed monitorship would\ndepend entirely on the monitor having a completely accurate picture of the defendant’s finances\nand access to all of her accounts and sources of wealth. Given the Court’s concerns about the\ndefendant’s candor, the Court should hesitate before trusting the defendant to be transparent with\na monitor under her employ.\n\nIn any event, even if the Court were to accept the defendant’s representations about her\nassets at face value, the defendant’s proposal would leave the defendant with significant assets\nunrestrained. In particular, the defendant’s proposal does not in any way restrain her $2 million\ntounhouse in London, which she could live in or sell to support herself. Although the defendant\nasserts that the monitor would oversee any account into which the proceeds of the sale of the\ndefendant’s properties were deposited, the defendant does not explain hou the monitor—or this\nCourt—would have the authority to force the defendant to deposit foreign assets in a domestic\naccount. As the Government has previously explained, the Government cannot realistically\nrecover assets abroad. Accordingly, the defendant’s proposal would leave her with access to at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol67\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020168.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, CoG3onfeIN 3SH6cOMent4G5i , Bil€GH3lo9/a he Rage ds ob 9\nPage 8\nleast $2 million. In addition, the defendant proposes that she retain an additional half a million\ndollars in liquid assets in an unrestrained account, as well as any future income.” That figure\nappears to be in addition to the approximately $l million in “chatels” the defendant has disclosed\namong her various assets. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. In short, the defendant’s proposal would leave\nher with ample resources to fund her flight from prosecution.\n\nFurther still, the defendant’s Motion provides only cursory details of the monitorship\nprogram she proposes, and it offers no legal precedent to explain what, if any, authority this Court\nhas to establish and oversee such a monitorship. Aside from defense counsel’s assertions, the\nMotion offers nothing that would enable the Court to meaningfully consider the details of such a\nmonitorship. Among other things, it is unclear from the defendant’s Motion whether such a\nprogram would require the defendant’s voluntary compliance with the monitorship, or whether the\nfunds would be placed in a bank account that the defendant could not access. Given that the\ndefendant’s Motion suggests that atorney’s fees could be disbursed without approval, it appears\nthat the defendant’s proposal would provide her latitude to engage in financial transactions, subject\nonly to a review that would require her voluntary compliance.\n\nFinally, although the defendant does not provide any detail about the amount of money she\nwould pay the monitor, presumably the monitor would not undertake this responsibility for free.\nAs a result, the tension between the monitor’s obligation to review the defendant’s finances and\nthe monitor’s employment relationship with the defendant creates a conflict of interest. But at\nbotom, if the Court determines that the only way to keep the defendant from using her assets to\nflee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too great a flight risk to release.\n\nIn sum, in light of this Court’s determination that the defendant “has not been fully candid\nabout her financial situation,” the Court should reject the defendant’s vague proposal. (Dec. Op.\nat 2). Nothing in the defendant’s Motion should alter the Court’s determination that the defendant\nposes a significant risk of flight, and that she has the resources and skills to flee prosecution. The\nCourt should reject the proposed bail conditions.\n\n3. The Defendant’s Pending Pretrial Motions Have Not Diminished the Strength\nof the Government’s Case\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that the “numerous substantive pretrial motions nou\nbefore the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.” (Mot. at 7).\nBut the defendant cannot merely point to the sheer volume of briefing she has filed to suggest that\nthe strength of the Government’s case has diminished. To the contrary, as the Government has set\nforth in detail in its memorandum in opposition, the defendant’s pretrial motions are entirely\nwithout merit. In any event, it is premature for the defendant to claim that her pretrial motions—\nwhich have not been adjudicated, much less granted—have altered the Court’s original\n> The defendant’s proposal also leaves unrestrained several million dollars in escrou for the\ndefendant’s legal fees. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9 (listing approximately $7.6 million in retainer fees);\nsee also Mot. at 6. If the defendant fled the country, her counsel would presumably be required to\nreturn those funds to the defendant, who would no longer need defense counsel in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol68\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020169.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, Co83onAeIN 3H6cOMent4G5i , BilEEH3lo9/a he Piagef Fd ob 9\nPage 9\ndetermination that the Government’s case is strong.\nIV. Conclusion\nThe defendant continues to represent a “plain[]” risk of flight. (Dec. Op. at l). Even\nassuming the Court has jurisdiction to grant this third bail motion, the two new bail conditions\noffer insufficient protection against the “substantial and actual risk of flight” this Court has already\nfound that the defendant poses.

Here, it is unclear whether interlocutory appeal of a\ndistrict court’s decision regarding bail “divests the court of its control over aspects of the case\ninvolved in the appeal.” United States v. Rodgers, lol F.3d 247, 25l (2d Cir. l996). Were it so, a\ndistrict court would have no authority to remand or modify bail conditions of a defendant\nreleased while the government appeals the grant of bail. Such a rule would detract from, rather\nthan promote, judicial economy and would be unworkable in practice.\n\nShould the Court believe it does not have jurisdiction to decide the present bail\nmotion, Ms. Maxwell will move the Circuit to withdraw her notice of appeal without\nprejudice and thereby remove any theoretical bar to this Court’s jurisdiction over the\npresent bail motion.

The leter asserts that the loss of\nFrench nationality subsequent to the criminal act which the person is alleged to have commited\ndoes not affect the rule against the extradition of nationals, as nationality must be assessed at the\ntime of commission of the offense and not at the time of the extradition request. As discussed in\nthe opinion from William Julie, French legal counsel (atached as Exhibit A), the\ngovernment’s assertion is entirely incorrect for the follouing reasons:\n\n= The government’s argument goes against the leter of the law.\n= The government’s argument goes against the spirit of the law.\n= The government’s argument is contradicted by precedent and case law.\n(Julie Opinion {ff 6-26).\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol76\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020177.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-68o o88oHAEN Bet uMMent/LVP l Fileasasi2 372l9 ePage@6 l65l8\n\nThe language of the extradition treaty between the United States and France and the\napplicable French statues are clear that anyone seeking to contest extradition on the basis of\nFrench citizenship must be a French national at the time of the extradition request. Ud. § ll).\nThe provisions on which the government relies were not intended to apply in cases where the\nperson whose extradition is sought had lost French citizenship. To the contrary, it was\ndesigned to apply to individuals who had acquired French citizenship subsequent to the\ncommission of the alleged crime “in order to avoid fraudulent nationality applications of\noffenders seeking to escape extradition.” (Ud. 4§ l5-l6). Ifthe person is no longer a French\nnational at the time of the request, the provision does not apply. The government cites no case\nwhere the relevant statute was applied to protect a formerly French national from extradition,\nand we have found none ourselves. (/d. {] l9-2l). By contrast, there are numerous examples\nof French courts deporting individuals who have lost French nationality follouing the\ncommission of an offense. (/d. 4 2l). Accordingly, Mr. Julie concludes: “[I]t cannot have been\nthe intention of French lawmakers that Article 696-4 be construed as meaning that a person\nwho has lost French nationality would still be entitled to be protected from extradition.” (/d.\n\n4] 26).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s agreement to give up both British and French citizenship and waive\nany and all right to contest extradition is a formidable challenge to the assertion that Ms.\nMaxwell would likely flee if released from custody and goes above and beyond the\n“reasonable assurances” that the Bail Reform Act requires to grant bail. While we\nmaintain that Ms. Maxwell’s writen waivers of the right to challenge extradition should\nsuffice, her willingness to forfeit citizenship birthrights exceeds what is necessary and\nprofoundly demonstrates her commitment to abide by conditions of release and appear at\ntrial.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol77\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020178.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN A6tuPMent/LVP l FileGsas2 372l9 ePage@6blG5l8\nMonitoring of Assets is a Valid and Significant <span class=\"highlight\">Condition</span> of Release\n\nTo address the Court’s concern about Ms. Maxwell’s access to assets, the bail\nmotion proposed another extremely significant and restrictive bail <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> — the\nimposition of a monitor to supervise the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse and\napprove expenditures. Rather than suggest conditions to satisfy its concerns, the\ngovernment urges the Court to summarily reject the proposed monitorship.\n\nWilliam S. Duffey, Jr., a retired federal district court judge and the former United\nStates Atorney for the Northern District of Georgia, has agreed to undertake appointment by\nthe Court as asset monitor. Judge Duffey has extensive experience evaluating and monitoring\nfunds held in and disbursed from financial accounts. He has agreed to serve by appointment of\nthe Court in a capacity similar to other trustees and receivers who serve as officers of the Court\nand are entrusted, pursuant to court order, with oversight authority to restrain, monitor, and\napprove disbursement of assets requiring his signature. Similar to others who have been\nappointed by courts to oversee financial maters, Judge Duffey will be compensated at the same\nhourly rate billed for his services as an ADR panelist for Federal Arbitration (FedArb).\n\nThe proceeds from the sale of Ms. Maxwell’s London home will be restrained and\nmonitored by Judge Duffey. As required by court order, documentation concerning the\nproceeds of the sale will be provided to Judge Duffey and the funds will be deposited in the\nfinancial account approved by Judge Duffey.\n\nThe government tries to steer the Court’s atention to allegations of Ms. Maxwell’s lack\nof candor to dissuade the Court from considering the proposed monitorship as a meaningful\nrestraint on the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse.

Since then, financial documents - collected and\nprofessionally veted by a highly respected accounting firm — have been submited to the\ngovernment and the Court and provide full details and supporting documentation concerning\nMs. Maxwell’s personal assets and those jointly held with the spouse. Further, no valid\nchallenge has been made to those submissions.\n\nThe government challenges the Court by inanely stating that if “the only way to keep\nthe defendant from using her assets to flee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too\ngreat a risk to release.” (Dkt.l65 at 8.) This statement is fundamentally illogical as it\nundermines most conditions of release. For example, the same could be said of electronic\nmonitoring — l.e., if the only way to keep a defendant from fleeing the jurisdiction is to place\nhim on home confinement with electronic monitoring, then he is too great a flight risk to\nrelease.* The Court should readily dismiss this frivolous argument. Under the Bail Reform Act,\nif there are appropriate conditions for release, bail should be granted. The conditions\ncollectively proposed in the previous and present bail applications provide ample assurance that\nMs. Maxwell will be present at trial.\n\n3 Moreover, in an effort to further obfuscate the merits of Ms. Maxwell’s bail application, the government\ndesperately argues that funds for legal services, presently held in atorney escrou accounts, would be\nreleased and made available to support Ms. Maxwell as a fugitive. To suggest that defense counsel would\nbecome accomplices to a violation of a court order shous uter disrespect for Ms. Maxwell’s defense team.\nIn particular, New York counsel, who have spent the entirety of their legal careers practicing in this district\nand establishing well-respected reputations among the bench and bar, take umbrage at the government’s\ncallous assertion.\n\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol79\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020182.jpg": "CaSedeZot epQ)C3GouAUNt Besutrent! l7o2 lF ib 83228/2 49 Piageoid Ob l8\nReform Act, Ms. Maxwell must be released unless there are \"no conditions\" that would\nreasonably assure her presence. Here, the proposed bail package - uniquely strengthened\nby Ms. Maxwell’s agreement to renunciate her foreign citizenship and have assets\nmonitored by a retired federal district court judge - satisfies the actual governing standard.\n\nTo find there are absolutely no conditions to satisfy flight risk of a 59-year-old\nwoman with no criminal history, who poses no danger to the community, who has made\nAmerica her home for the past 3o years, and who has established strong roots and forged\nimportant connections with family and friends who reside here, is incredulous. The\nconcerns regarding foreign citizenship and restraint of assets have been addressed. To say\nthat renunciation of foreign citizenship and strict monitoring of assets by a retired federal\ndistrict court judge does not suffice when combined with an eight-figure bond secured by\nreal property and cash and the strictest terms of home confinement and electronic\nmonitoring strains credulity. The government gains a strategic advantage each day Ms.\nMaxwell remains in custody — her case is tried daily in the court of public opinion based\non allegations that are inadmissible in a court of law; the likelihood of seating jurors who\nare not implicitly biased against her is being severely jeopardized; her physical strength\nand concentration are becoming increasingly impaired by the conditions of her\nconfinement; and she is being denied a full and fair opportunity to prepare her case for\ntrial.®\n8 Ms. Maxwell continues to experience difficulty reviewing electronic discovery, including discs that can only be\nreviewed on the MDC computer but are not readable on that computer, and thousands of pages still not readable on\neither the MDC computer or the laptop.

Third, the French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation is contradicted by precedents\nand case law\n\nl9. The French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation finds no support in case law, as no case\ncan be found where Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure was applied\nto protect a formerly French national from extradition.\n\n2o. Instead, precedents exist in which Article 696-4,l° of the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure was relied on by French authorities to execute an extradition request against\nan individual who had acquired French nationality after commiting an offence, which\nis the natural use of this provision (for example, a ruling issued by the Criminal Chamber\nof the French Cour de cassation on 4 January 2oo6, n°o5-86.258).\n\n2l. Although we have found no precedent where French authorities were faced with the\nextradition of a person who had lost French nationality, we have found cases where\nFrench authorities were faced with the deportation of a person who had lost French\nnationality. Both extradition and deportation allou for the removal of a person from\nFrench territory by the police and its surrender to the authorities of a third State, with\nthe consent and cooperation of the authorities of that State.\n\n22.

The\nDefendant has been incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center since that time.\n\nThe Defendant renewed her motion for release on bail on December 8, 2o2o. The Court\nagain denied the Defendant’s motion. In doing so, the Court explained that none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments materially impacted its conclusion that the Defendant posed a risk of\nflight. It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry\nlengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the Government,\nincluding multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant’s\nsubstantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol93\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020194.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN A6tuPMheht/LOP l Filecsas2 2729 ePageBlGhl2\nescape; and that the Defendant’s lack of candor regarding her family ties and financial situations\nraised serious doubts as to her willingness to comply with any conditions imposed by the Court.\nSee Dkt.

The Court may order that the defendant be held without bail only if, after\nconsidering the factors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>\nor combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and\nthe safety of any other person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nAfter a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can\nreasonably assure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Bail Reform Act allous the\nCourt to reopen the bail hearing if “information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the\ntime of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue” of whether pretrial detention is\nwarranted. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f). The Court is not required to do so if it determines that any new\ninformation would not have a material bearing on the issue. See United States v. Raniere, No.\nl8-CR-2o4l (NGG) (VMS), 2ol8 WL 63442o2, at *2 n.7 (E.D.N.Y.

Supp. 2d 335, 339 (W.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (electing not to reopen a detention hearing\nbecause the new information would not have changed the court’s decision to detain the defendant\nuntil trial). In addition, the Court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent\nauthority, even when the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text. See, e.g., United\nStates v.

The Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the Defendant presents a risk of flight and that there are no\nset of conditions, including the Defendant’s third set of proposed conditions, that are sufficient to\nreasonably assure her appearance. The presumption in favor of detention, the weight of the\nevidence, and the history and characteristics of the Defendant all continue to support that\nconclusion. The Defendant’s proposed conditions do not alter the Court’s determination.\n\nA. The Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors has not changed\n\nTo begin with, the presumption in favor of detention continues to apply with equal force.\nSee Dkt. No. lo6 (“Dec. Op.”) at 7-8. And though the Court again concludes that the Defendant\nhas met her burden of production, the presumption “remains a factor to be considered among\nthose weighed by the district court.” Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436 (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at\nll44). The Court is mindful “that Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of\nflight, and that ‘a strong probability arises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate\nto secure their appearance.” Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nThe Court’s analysis of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors also remains unchanged.\n\nBecause the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged include crimes involving a minor\nvictim, the first l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factor continues to weigh strongly in favor of detention.\nAnd the Court remains of the opinion that the Defendant does not pose a danger to any person or\nto the community. The fourth § 3l42(g) factor thus weighs against detention.\n\nWith respect to the second § 3l42(g) factor, none of the Defendant’s new arguments alter\nthe Court’s conclusion as to the weight of the evidence. The Defendant argues that the pre-trial\nmotions “raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of charges, if not the entire\nindictment,” and she contends that “[t]hese motions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol97\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020198.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN A6tuPMeht/LOP l Filecsas22F2I9 ePagei7 l6l2\nof the government’s case and warrant granting bail on the conditions proposed.” Def. Mot. at 7.\nThose motions became fully briefed one week ago and are nou pending before this Court. The\nGovernment strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated\nthem. Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the\npresumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the proffered strength\nand nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention. See Dec.\nOp. at 9-lo.\n\nThe Court’s assessment of the Defendant’s history and characteristics has not changed.\nSee Dec. Op. at lo-l6. The Defendant continues to have substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\ndetection. /d. at lo-ll. And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor\nregarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor. See Dec. Op.\nat l6. There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\nconditions of release. Jd. While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors. While the fourth factor continues to\nfavor release, the first three factors and the presumption of detention all support the conclusion\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2ol98\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020199.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN A6tuPMeht/LOP l Filecsas2 272l9 ePageBlGhl2\nthat the Defendant poses a significant risk of flight. Thus, the Court again concludes that there\nare no conditions of release that will reasonably assure her appearance in future proceedings.\n\nB. Pretrial detention continues to be warranted\n\nThe thrust of the Defendant’s argument in her third motion for bail is that the two new\nproposed conditions vitiate the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight. The Defendant first\noffers to renounce her French and British citizenship. Def. Mot. at 2. And she also proposes to\nhave most of her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be monitored by a\nretired federal judge, who would function as an asset monitor and will have co-signing authority\nover the account. /d. Those conditions are offered in addition to the bail package she proposed\nin December. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7; see also Def. Mot. at 2. The new bail package does not\ndisturb the Court’s conclusion that the Government has carried its burden of shouing that these\nconditions are insufficient to mitigate the flight risks, and the Court again determines that no set\nof conditions—including the two new ones—can reasonably assure her future appearance.\n\nThe Court begins with the Defendant’s offer to renounce her French and United Kingdom\ncitizenship. She notes that she can renounce her UK citizenship “immediately upon granting of\nbail,” and she informs the Court that “[t]he process of renouncing her French citizenship, while\nnot immediate, may be expedited.” Def. Mot. at 4. As the Government notes, the offer is of\nunclear validity, and the relevance and practical impact of the renunciations is, at best, unclear.\nSee Gov’t Opp’n at 5. With respect to her offer to renounce her French citizenship, the Court is\nagain confronted with dueling opinions on the correct interpretation of French law. The\nGovernment relies on the position of the head of the International Criminal Assistance Bureau of\nthe French Ministry of Justice, who argues that “the fact that the wanted individual is a French\nnational constitutes an insuperable obstacle to his/her removal,” and that “[a]s long as said\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol99\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020201.jpg": "CaSede2ol ep) o33o4ATNt Dib cute l682 lFikeG 83222 /249 Padgeol d Ob l2\nparallel those that the Court articulated when the Defendant proposed signing an extradition\nwaiver. See Dec. Op. at l2-l3.\n\nSimilar doubts exist as to the Defendant’s offer to renounce her UK citizenship. The\nCourt is persuaded by the Government’s arguments that even if the Defendant were to renounce\nher UK citizenship, she would still likely be able to delay or resist extradition from the UK. See\nGov’t Opp’n at 6-7. And for largely similar reasons, the Court again concludes that the\nproposed conditions do not meaningfully diminish the Court’s concerns regarding the\nDefendant’s ability to flee and to frustrate or impair any subsequent extradition atempts. The\npossibility that the Defendant could successfully resist or forestall extradition heightens the\nDefendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nTo summarize, the Defendant’s willingness to renounce her French and UK citizenship\ndoes not sufficiently assuage the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight that the Defendant\nposes. Considerable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the\nrenunciations cloud whatever relevance they might otherwise have to the Court’s assessment of\nwhether the Defendant poses a risk of flight. See United States v. Cohen, No. C lo-oo547 (SD,\n2olo WL 5387757, at *9 n.ll (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2o, 2olo). And that same uncertainty—and the\npossibility that she will be able to successfully resist, or at least delay, extradition—incentivizes\nflight, particularly because of the Defendant’s substantial international ties.\n\nNor does the second proposed <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> materially alter the Court’s determination that no\n<span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions can reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The\nDefendant proposes to have a retired federal judge provide oversight authority over her financial\naffairs, and, if granted, he would have the authority to restrain, monitor, and approve\ndisbursement of assets requiring his signature. See Reply at 5. The Court continues to have\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2o2ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020202.jpg": "CaSede2ol ep) o33o4AUNt Dib cute l682 lFikeG 83222 /249 Plageoct l Ob l2\nconcerns about whether the full extent of the Defendant’s assets have been disclosed in light of\nthe lack of transparency when she was first arrested. But the Court assumes, for purposes of\nresolving this motion, that the financial report that it reviewed in December is accurate and that it\naccounts for all of the Defendant’s and her spouse’s assets. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7.\n\nThe monitorship <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> does not reasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance,\neven when viewed in combination with the rest of the Defendant’s bail package. The Defendant\nwould continue to have access to substantial assets—certainly enough to enable her flight and to\nevade prosecution. These include the $45o,ooo that the Defendant would retain for living\nexpenses and any future salaries for her or her spouse, along with other assets, including jewelry\nand other chatels, that are potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. See Def. Mot. at\n5-6; see also Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. While those amounts may be a small percentage of the\nDefendant’s total assets, they represent a still-substantial amount that could easily facilitate\nflight. When combined with the Court’s weighing of the § 3l42(g) factors and the presumption\nof detention, the Court concludes that the proposed restraints are insufficient to alter its\nconclusion that no combination of conditions can reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nIf the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could reasonably assure the\nDefendant’s future appearance, it would order her release. Yet while her proposed bail package\nis substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable assurances. As a result, the Court again\ndetermines that “no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the\nappearance of” the Defendant, and it denies her motion for bail on this basis. l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(l).\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2o2o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020204.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 39-3, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Pagel45 of l65\nExhibit M\nDoe. l59\nGhislaine Maxwell’s Leter Regarding MDC Conditions\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020205.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8; Co68osAeIN 3D6cOrhernit 453l , Bled 52ol G/ahe Pagef l Ob 3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Ghislaine Maxwell\n2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe government’s recent leter regarding MDC conditions (Dkt.l58) essentially repeats\nthe same points it made in defense of the MDC’s request that the Court vacate its order directing\nthe MDC to permit Ms. Maxwell to use a laptop on weekends and holidays. We appreciate the\nCourt’s concern regarding Ms. Maxwell’s opportunity to review discovery and the extent to\nwhich she is required to undergo searches. The government’s leter, houever, does not include\nthe concerns defense counsel has reported to MDC Legal during the past couple of months. In\naddition, the leter incorrectly states that legal calls are available on Saturdays. Such requests by\ncounsel have been denied.\n\nBy ignoring the myriad other issues reported by counsel, the government’s leter\nmisrepresents Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement. Ms. Maxwell does not have access to\ndaily discovery review for the entirety of the l3 hours. The vagaries and delays of moving her\nthe 5o feet or so from the isolation cell to the day room are a large part of the challenge.\n\nThe number of searches is also not correct. Ms. Maxwell is searched on every move,\nincluding to the empty concrete space, adjacent to the day room, used for recreation. Currently,\nshe is subject to a minimum of four pat doun searches a day if she goes to rec, and five pat doun\nsearches on the day of her weekly body scan. Since July 6\", Ms. Maxwell has been physically\nsearched approximately l4oo times, including pat doun searches, metal wand searches, mouth,\nhair and ear searches (posing additional health risks during COVID), and upwards of 6o body\nscans. In addition, there have been hundreds of physical searches of her isolation cell, locker,\nlegal papers, and personal effects. No contraband has ever been found.\n\nWe take issue with MDC’s assessment that “the searches are all necessary for the safety\nof the institution and the defendant.” Ms. Maxwell is under 24-hour surveillance by two to six\nguards and approximately l8 cameras, not including the hand-held camera, focused on her\nthroughout the areas in which she is moved and confined. Ms. Maxwell poses no danger to\nanyone. Her restrictive conditions, searches, and constant surveillance correlate directly to BOP\nnegligence resulting in the death of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020207.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, Co838onseIN 3SD6cOMenl45Hl , Bil€GH2ol 6/24 e Pagef 3 Ob 3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIA\\\n\nIt is impossible to overstate the deleterious effect of the conditions under which Ms.\nMaxwell is detained. Upon arrival at the MDC seven months ago, she was placed on suicide\nwatch though no competent medical professional deemed her in any manner suicidal, nor has any\npsychologist or medical staffer ever found her to be suicidal at any time during her detention.\n\nFor weeks she was deprived of legal material, the ability to use a telephone to make personal\ncalls, and the opportunity to exercise and shouer. Clearly, this was an effort to avoid a\nrecurrence of the BOP’s negligence regarding Jeffrey Epstein’s death. Contrary to the way she is\nhyper-monitored, Ms. Maxwell is classified with the standard CCl-Mh designation: inmate with\nno significant mental health care.\n\nThe overall conditions of detention have had a detrimental impact on Ms. Maxwell’s\nhealth and overall well-being; and she is withering to a shell of her former self — losing weight,\nlosing hair, and losing her ability to concentrate. In addition to the many difficulties impacting\nher review of electronic discovery materials, the over-management and stress are impacting her\nstamina and effectiveness in preparing her defense and conferring with counsel.\n\nHaving been incarcerated in de facto solitary confinement for 225 days and monitored by\ntwo to six guards 24 hours a day with a handheld camera dedicated to capturing her every move,\nexcept when it would record improper conduct on the part of the guards, it is not surprising that\nMs. Maxwell feels she is detained under the control of the Bureau of “Pretrial Punishment.”\n\nVery truly yours,\nBOBBI C.

Mr. Robertson pled not guilty to the charges at an arraignment held on December\nll, 2ol7 [Doc. 9] and a trial in the case will be set for April 5, 2o2l, about two months from today.\n\nAlthough presumed innocent of all charges, Mr. Robertson has been in pretrial detention\nin this case for over three years. He was arrested on December ll, 2ol7 and was ordered detained\nthe same day by Magistrate Judge B.

The government opposes the requested reconsideration. Doc. 282.\n\nDISCUSSION\nl. Reconsideration is Proper on the Basis of New Evidence Previously Unavailable.\n\nAs an initial mater, Mr. Robertson has raised legitimate reasons for the Court to reconsider\nits earlier release decision. As the Court has previously explained, it is well-established in this\nCircuit that although the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure do not expressly authorize a motion\nfor reconsideration, such motions are proper in criminal cases. See United States v. Christy, 739\nF.3d 534, 539 (loth Cir. 2ol4). A district court thus may amend its interlocutory orders prior to\nentry of final judgment. See, e.g., Van Skiver v. United States, 952 F.2d l24l, l243 (loth Cir.\n' All references to the transcript are to the draft copy.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020214.jpg": "Casse :27-o8,o284orMMt DoesumePAtl BOR l FROG O22o6 24g Aagee t6l6\nRobertson release in September of last year, it believed that he would only remain in pretrial\ndetention for three additional months until a December 7, 2o2o trial date. Doc. l94. As bad as\nthe pandemic had been to that point, the Court did not expect the federal judiciary to remain in a\nstate of near total suspension for another six months, requiring the trial to be continued twice more\nto the current April 5, 2o2l trial date. Second, when the Court denied Mr. Robertson release last\nSeptember, it was under the impression that he would be able to meet with his atorneys in person\nin conference rooms at the Albuquerque courthouse, mitigating the Court’s concerns about the\ndefense team’s ability to effectively prepare for trial. See supra at 4. The Court’s impression on\nthat point turned out to be incorrect: due to concerns about inmates meeting with atorneys and\nthen bringing COVID-l9 back into the jails, the idea of unrestricted atorney-client meetings at\nthe Albuquerque courthouse was ultimately rejected. Third, the Court is nou able to impose\nsignificantly stricter conditions of release because of its ability to release Mr. Robertson to La\nPasada Halfway House, an option with which it was not presented last September.\n\nI. Mr. Robertson’s Release to La Pasada Halfway House Under Extremely Strict\nand Carefully Tailored Conditions Will Reasonably Assure His Appearance and\nthe Safety of the Community Under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e).\n\nOn the merits, the Court has thoroughly considered the parties’ arguments, the UPSO’s\nrecommendations, Mr. Robertson’s Form l3 Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) and the\ninformation contained therein about his criminal history and prior performance on release, and the\napplicable law. Although the government’s concerns are understandable, the Court ultimately\nbelieves that it can reasonably assure Mr. Robertson’s appearance and the safety of the community\nby releasing him to La Pasada Halfway House under a number of extremely strict and carefully\ntailored conditions.\n\nUnder l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e), a defendant must be released pending trial unless, after a\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020215.jpg": "Cased 27-o8,o284orMMt DoesutPAtl BU l FROG O22o6/2agFAageo’ 6l6\n\nhearing, a judicial officer finds that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions will reasonably\nassure the defendant’s appearance as required and the safety of any other person and the\ncommunity. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The government bears the burden of proving flight risk by\na preponderance of the evidence and dangerousness to any other person or the community by clear\nand convincing evidence. United States v. Cisneros, 328 F.3d 6lo, 6l6 (loth Cir. 2oo3). A district\ncourt’s review of a Magistrate Judge’s order of detention is de novo. See Cisneros, 328 F.3d at\n6l6.\n\nSection 3l42(e)(2) creates a rebutable presumption that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combinations of\nconditions exist to reasonably assure a defendant’s appearance or the safety of the community\nwhere there is probable cause to believe the defendant violated l8 U.S.C. § 924(c). See l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(e)(3)(B). As the Tenth Circuit has held:\n\nOnce the presumption is invoked, the burden of production shifts to the defendant.\n\nHouever, the burden of persuasion regarding risk-of-flight and danger to the\n\ncommunity always remains with the government. The defendant’s burden of\n\nproduction is not heavy, but some evidence must be produced. Even if a\n\ndefendant’s burden of production is met, the presumption remains a factor for\n\nconsideration by the district court in determining whether to release or detain.\nUnited States v. Stricklin, 932 F.2d l353, l354-55 (loth Cir. l99l).\n\nHere, although Mr. Robertson is subject to a presumption of detention due to his § 924(c)\ncharge, see Doc. 86 at l—2, the Court finds that he has successfully rebuted the presumption. He\nhas produced evidence, for example, that he is not a danger to the community nor a flight risk\nbecause he voluntarily turned himself in on the instant offense, despite consistently maintaining\nhis innocence and knouing the extremely long prison sentence he faced if convicted. Doc. 274 at\n5. He has also produced evidence that he will not flee the jurisdiction due to his family’s presence\nhere. Jd. And he has produced evidence that his placement at La Pasada Halfway House is a\n<span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> of release that could reasonably assure his appearance and the safety of the community.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020216.jpg": "Cass4 27-o8,o284orMMt DoesutPAt BO l FROG o22o6 /2agFages8 6l6\nDoc. 284 at 2-3. Mr. Robertson has met his burden of production and has rebuted the presumption\nin § 3l42(e)(3)(B) that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions could meet the requirements for\nhis release.\n\nSection 3l42(g) then lays out the follouing factors for courts to consider: (l) the nature\nand circumstances of the offense charged, including whether the offense is a crime of violence, a\nviolation of § l59l, a Federal crime of terrorism, or involves a minor victim or a controlled\nsubstance, firearm, explosive, or destructive device; (2) the weight of the evidence against the\ndefendant; (3) the history and characteristics of the defendant; and (4) the nature and seriousness\nof the danger to any person or community that would be posed by the defendant’s release. l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nThe Court finds that although some of these factors weigh against Mr. Robertson’s release,\nthey do not foreclose relief under the strict conditions the Court has imposed. With regard to the\nnature and circumstances of the offenses charged, they are extremely serious and involve Mr.\nRobertson allegedly shooting a victim, D.S., in retaliation for his cooperation with the government\nin an earlier criminal case. As the Court stated at the November 4, 2o2l pretrial conference, it\ntakes Mr. Robertson’s charges extremely seriously because the ability of witnesses to come\nforward and safely provide information to the government, and to the Court, is at the core of our\ncriminal justice system.\n\nWith regard to the weight of the evidence against Mr. Robertson, it is mixed. On the one\nhand, D.S. positively identified Mr. Robertson as the person who shot him and at least one other\nwitness, N.F., has testified that Mr. Robertson made incriminating statements in the weeks prior\nto the shooting. On the other hand, it appears that there were many people present at the time and\nplace of the shooting and there is evidence that D.S.’s identification of Mr. Robertson could have\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020217.jpg": "Cased :27-o8,o284orMMt DoesutPAtl BO l FROG O22o6 24g Fagecd F6l6\nbeen influenced by the suggestion of others, including his girlfriend at the time and the police who\ncame to question him in the hospital.\n\nWith regard to Mr. Robertson’s history and characteristics, his history of violating past\nconditions of release is a source of concern, as the Court noted when denying him release last\nSeptember. See supra at 4. More specifically, Mr. Robertson’s Form l3 PSR notes several\ninstances in which his probation was revoked for failure to comply with conditions of release.\nDoc. l88 at 8-lo. Mr. Robertson also has several prior convictions. /d. Houever, as the defense\nhas pointed out, none of Mr. Robertson’s probation revocations appear to have involved him\nabsconding; although he has convictions for illegal firearm possession, he does not have any\nconvictions for violent offenses; and he turned himself after being charged in the instant case. /d.;\nsee also Doc. 274 at 4-5.\n\nFinally, with regard to the nature and seriousness of the danger that would be posed to any\nperson or the community by Mr. Robertson’s release, the Court understands the government’s\nconcerns given the frightening allegations in this case. Mr. Robertson is presumed innocent on all\ncharges until proven guilty, houever. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42() (“Nothing in this section shall be\nconstrued as modifying or limiting the presumption of innocence.”). Presuming Mr. Robertson’s\ninnocence in this case, while he is someone who has been convicted of gun and drug offenses and\nhas failed to comply with conditions of release in the past, he is not someone with a proven history\nof violent behavior.” Nor is the Court persuaded by the government’s vague suggestions that Mr.\nRobertson might have tried to contact or intimidate witnesses in this case because it has provided\nno concrete or specific evidence to substantiate any such claims. For example, the government’s\ncryptic report that witness N.F. was allegedly contacted by an unnamed individual about this case\n* While Mr. Robertson does have prior arrests for violent offenses, these charges were all dismissed and are\ntherefore unproven allegations. See Doc. l88 at ll-l5.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020218.jpg": "Cdsest P7-creo 2atauivient DecuMdl BA62 Filkeh62/o6/Phg Pao diol66l6\nis not a valid reason to deny Mr. Robertson release because the government has not come forward\nwith any details to corroborate N.F.’s account or to link Mr. Robertson to the alleged contact.\n\nMore importantly, the Court has imposed a number of extremely strict and carefully\ntailored conditions of release that it believes will be more than sufficient to reasonably assure Mr.\nRobertson’s appearance and the safety of the community. Mr. Robertson will be placed at La\nPasada Halfway House, where he will be on home incarceration with active GPS tracking, the\nstrictest form of location monitoring available to the Court. Doc. 3ol at 2. He will not be alloued\nto leave La Pasada for any reason other than to meet with his atorneys, and he will not be alloued\nto transport himself to those meetings; his atorneys will have to transport him. /d. He will not be\nalloued any visitors at La Pasada except for his atorneys. /d. He will not be alloued to use or\npossess a cellphone, nor to borrou anyone else’s cellphone. /d. He will not be alloued to use the\nlandline at La Pasada, except to speak to his atorneys. /d. He will not be alloued to have contact\nwith anyone other than his Pretrial Services officer and his atorneys. /d. That includes no contact\nwith his family members until he shous the Court that he is fully compliant with all of his\nconditions of release. /d. He will not be alloued to use or possess drugs or alcohol. /d. He will\nbe alloued to participate in counseling at La Pasada to help him cope with the stress of his looming\ntrial. Jd. He will be required to abide by all rules and regulations of the halfway house, houever\nsmall. Jd.\n\nThe Court believes that with all of these conditions, and under the close supervision of the\nstaff at La Pasada and his Pretrial Services officer, Mr. Robertson will not pose a danger to the\ncommunity or a risk of flight. The Court also cautioned Mr. Robertson at the February 4, 2o2l\npretrial conference that if he violates any of these conditions of release, the Court will not hesitate\nto reincarcerate him immediately. The Court accordingly finds that there are conditions, or a\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020219.jpg": "Cdsest P7-creo 2axtauivient DecuMdl BA62 Filke662o6/Phg Peoye dill66l6\ncombination of conditions, that will reasonably assure Mr. Robertson’s appearance and the safety\nof any person and the community. His pretrial release is therefore required by l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e).\n\nlil. Mr. Robertson’s Release is Necessary for the Preparation of His Trial Defense\nUnder l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i).\n\nThe Court additionally finds that Mr. Robertson’s release is necessary for the preparation\nof his trial defense under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i). That section allous a judicial officer who issued an\norder of detention to, by subsequent order, “permit the temporary release of the person, in the\ncustody of a United States marshal or another appropriate person, to the extent that the judicial\nofficer determines such release to be necessary for preparation of the person’s defense or for\nanother compelling reason.” § 3l42(i).2 The defendant bears the burden of establishing their\nentitlement to temporary release under § 3l42(i). United States v. Clark, 448 F. Supp. 3d ll52,\nll55 (D. Kan. 2o2o) (citation omited). Courts considering whether pretrial release is necessary\nfor the preparation of the person’s defense have considered: “(l) [the] time and opportunity the\ndefendant has to prepare for the trial and to participate in his defense; (2) the complexity of the\ncase and volume of information; and (3) expense and inconvenience associated with preparing\nwhile incarcerated.” United States v. Boatwright, ---F. Supp. 3d---, No. 2:l9-CR-oo3ol-GMN-\nDJA, 2o2o WL l639855, at *4 (D. Nev. Apr. 2, 2o2o) (unreported) (citations omited).\n\nHere, all of those factors weigh in favor of release. Because Mr. Robertson’s trial will be\nreset for April 5, 2o2l, he and his defense team have only two months left to prepare.\n> While the Court recognizes that Magistrate Judge Briones is the judicial officer that issued Mr.\nRobertson’s initial order of detention, this mater is before the Court on Mr. Robertson’s request that the\nCourt review that detention order under l8 U.S.C. § 3l45(b). See Doc. 274 at l. The Tenth Circuit has not\nyet ruled on whether a request for temporary release under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i) can only be decided by the\nMagistrate Judge that issued the initial order of detention. See United States v. Alderete, 336 F.R.D. 24o,\n268 (D.N.M. 2o2o). But at least one other federal district court has recently considered and granted pretrial\nrelease under that section. See United States v. Stephens, 447 F. Supp. 3d 63, 66-68 (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o)\n(Nathan, J.); but see Alderete, 336 F.R.D. at 268.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020220.jpg": "Cdsest P7-creo 2axtauivient DecyuMdi BA62 Filke62o6/PhgPHye di2l66l6\nComplicating maters further is the fact that both of Mr. Robertson’s initial defense atorneys have\nrecently withdrawn from the case, and both of his current atorneys have been appointed within\nthe past six months (one in the last three weeks). The defense team therefore has a considerable\namount of catching up to do in a very short amount of time, and defense counsel need to\nimmediately begin meeting with Mr. Robertson on a regular basis. The case is also complex and\nexceedingly serious. The government has named 24 witnesses on its most recent witness list [Doc.\nlo4] and the Court has issued upwards of 3o writen orders over the past three years of contentious\npretrial litigation in this case. And if Mr. Robertson is convicted on all charges, he will be facing\ndecades in prison: according to his Form l3 PSR, Mr. Robertson’s effective guidelines range\nwould be a staggering 4l2 to 485 months of imprisonment, or approximately 34 to 4o years. See\nDoc. l88 at l5.\n\nFinally, defense counsel explained at the recent pretrial conference that it will be\nimpossible for them to effectively prepare the case for trial with Mr. Robertson in custody under\nthe current lockdoun conditions due to COVID-l9. In normal times, defense counsel can meet\nwith their clients face to face in meeting rooms at the jails, where they can review discovery and\ndo other critical trial preparation. Nou, houever, if the jails are allouing in-person client meetings\nat all, itis with the defendants separated from their counsel by a screen, making it nearly impossible\nto effectively review documentary evidence. And while defense counsel represented that the Santa\nFe County Detention Center is allouing video meetings by Zoom, it is hard to schedule Zoom time\ndue to the limited number of computer facilities at the jail and the number of parties vying for them\n(including this Court). Defense counsel also represented that while the Zoom meetings have been\nhelpful, the Detention Center has not alloued them to shou Mr. Robertson documents by sharing\ntheir screen, requiring counsel to instead hold the documents up to their computer’s camera in the\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o22o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020241.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page/ of 25\nAlthough the defense argued that Maxwell did not leave the United States after\nEpstein’s arrest and was in contact with the Government through counsel, Judge\nNathan emphasized that Maxwell “did not provide the government with her\nwhereabouts,” and, in any event, “the reality that Ms. Maxwell may face such serious\ncharges herself may not have set in until after she was actually indicted.” (/d. at 84-\n85).\n\nl4. Accordingly, Judge Nathan found that the Government had\ncarried its burden of demonstrating that Maxwell “poses a substantial actual risk of\nflight” and that “even the most restrictive conditions of release would be\ninsufficient” to ensure Maxwell’s appearance. (/d. at 86). Though the proposed bail\npackage represented only a fraction of Maxwell’s assets, Judge Nathan found that\n“even a substantially larger package would be insufficient.” (/d.). She noted that\nalthough Maxwell “apparently failed to submit a full accounting or even a close to\nfull accounting of her financial situation,” “[e]ven if the picture of her financial\nresources were not opaque, as it is, detention would still be appropriate.” (/d. at 86-\n87). That conclusion was informed by Maxwell’s “significant financial resources”\nand “demonstrated sophistication in hiding those resources and herself.” (/d. at 87).\nJudge Nathan emphasized that Maxwell’s “recent conduct underscores her\nextraordinary capacity to evade detection, even in the face of what the defense has\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o24l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020242.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page8 of 25\nacknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.).4 Judge Nathan\nconcluded that electronic monitoring and private security guards “would be\ninsufficient” because Maxwell could remove the monitor and evade private guards.\n(/d. at 87-88). She also rejected Maxwell’s comparison to certain other high-profile\ndefendants, citing “crucial factual differences” in those cases. (/d. at 88).\n\nl5. Finally, Judge Nathan rejected Maxell’s arguments about the\nrisks of COVID-l9 and the difficulty of preparing a defense with an incarcerated\nclient, noting that Maxwell had many months to prepare for trial and has no\nunderlying conditions that place her at heightened risk of complications from\nCOVID-l9.° (/d. at 89-9o). Judge Nathan found that measures in place were\nsufficient to ensure Maxwell’s access to her counsel, but also directed the\nGovernment to work with the defense “to provide adequate communication between\ncounsel and client” and stated that the defense may make specific applications to the\nDistrict Court for further relief if the process was “inadequate in any way.” (/d. at\n9o-9l).\n\n* For example, Maxwell did not leave her home but had security guards make\npurchases for her using a credit card in the name of an LLC. Before her arrest,\nMaxwell ignored FBI agents’ directions to open the door and tried to flee to another\nroom in the house. A cell phone was found wrapped in tin foil on top of a desk.

The Second Bail Application\n\nl6. On December 8, 2o2o, Maxwell renewed her request for bail,\npresenting a revised bail package with additional financial restrictions. (Ex. E). After\nconsidering multiple writen submissions (Ex. E, F, G), Judge Nathan denied\nMaxwell’s application in a writen opinion (Ex. H).\n\nl7. Judge Nathan found that the arguments presented “either were\nmade at the initial bail hearing or could have been made then” and the new\ninformation “only solidifies the Court’s view that [Maxwell] plainly poses a risk of\nflight and that no combination of conditions can ensure her appearance.” (Ex. H at\nl-2). Judge Nathan explained:\n\nthe charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are\n\nserious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if\n\nconvicted; the evidence proffered by the Government,\n\nincluding multiple corroborating and _ corroborated\n\nwitnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial\n\nresources and foreign ties (including citizenship in a\n\ncountry that does not extradite its citizens); and the\n\nDefendant, who lived in hiding and apart from the family\n\nto whom she nou asserts important ties, has not been fully\n\ncandid about her financial situation.\n\n(Ud. at 2).\n\nl8. Judge Nathan rejected Maxwell’s claim that the Government\noverstated the strength of its case at the bail hearing, finding that Maxwell “too easily\ndiscredits the witness testimony.” (/d. at 9-lo). Judge Nathan credited the\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o243\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020245.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagell of 25\nincomplete or erroneous information to the Court or to Pretrial Services bears\nsignificantly” on her assessment of Maxwell’s history and characteristics. (/d. at l5).\nJudge Nathan highlighted that in July 2o2o Maxwell represented to Pretrial Services\nthat she possessed around $3.5 million in assets, but in connection with her renewed\nrequest for bail presented a report on her finances that estimated the net worth of\nMaxwell and her spouse to be approximately $22.5 million as of October 2o2o. (/d.\nat l5). Judge Nathan found that the difference “makes it unlikely that the\nmisrepresentation was the result of the Defendant’s misestimation rather than\nmisdirection.” (/d. at l5-l6). She explained:\n\nIn sum, the evidence of a lack of candor is, if anything,\n\nstronger nou than in July 2o2o, as it is clear to the Court\n\nthat the Defendant’s representations to Pretrial Services\n\nwere woefully incomplete. That lack of candor raises\n\nsignificant concerns as to whether the Court has nou been\n\nprovided a full and accurate picture of her finances and as\n\nto the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\n\nconditions of release.\n\n(Ud. at l6).\n\n2l. Judge Nathan again concluded that Maxwell presented a risk of\nflight and that Maxwell’s proposed bail package “cannot reasonably assure her\nappearance,” as it “would leave unrestrained millions of dollars and other assets that\nshe could sell in order to support herself’ and the “proposed bond is only partially\nsecured.” (/d. at l6-l8).

Judge\nNathan also rejected Maxwell’s proposed conditions of release to a relative’s\ncustody and private security guards, reiterating her concern regarding Maxwell’s\n“extraordinary capacity to evade detection.” (/d. at l8-l9).\n\n22. Finally, Judge Nathan was “unpersuaded” by Maxwell’s\nargument “that the conditions of her confinement are uniquely onerous, interfere\nwith her ability to participate in her defense, and thus justify release.” (/d. at 2o).\nMaxwell did not “meaningfully dispute” that she has received more time than other\ninmates at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) to review discovery and as\nmuch, if not more, time to communicate with her lawyers. (/d.). Judge Nathan\nreiterated that she would continue to ensure that Maxwell is able to speak and meet\nregularly with her atorneys and review discovery to prepare her defense. (/d. at 2o\nn.3).\n\nD. = The Third Bail Application\n\n23.

She reiterated that detention was warranted\nin light of the proffered strength and nature of the Government’s case, Maxwell’s\n“substantial international ties, familial and personal connections abroad, substantial\nfinancial resources, and experience evading detection,” and Maxwell’s “lack of\ncandor regarding her assets” at the time of her arrest. (/d. at 7).\n\n25. Judge Nathan rejected Maxwell’s argument that the strength of\nthe evidence was diminished by Maxwell’s pending pre-trial motions. (/d. at 5-6).\nShe also rejected the two additional conditions proposed by Maxwell, noting the\n“Tclonsiderable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the\n[foreign citizenship] renunciations,” and finding that, despite the proposed\nmonitorship, Maxwell “would continue to have access to substantial assets—\ncertainly enough to enable her flight and to evade prosecution.” (/d. at lo-ll).

The Government most recently filed such an update on April 6, 2o2l,\nnoting, among other things, Maxwell’s extensive access to discovery and\ncommunications with counsel; her regular access to outdoor recreation; the thirteen\nhours per day during which she is brought to a day room outside of her cell with\nexclusive access to a television, a phone, two computers, and a shouer; and her\naccess to medical care, including the COVID-l9 vaccine, which she has nou\nreceived.

Judge Nathan did not clearly err when she determined that\nMaxwell is a risk of flight and that no conditions would reasonably assure her\nappearance in court. Nor did Judge Nathan abuse her discretion or clearly err by\ndenying Maxwell’s request for temporary release.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n28. In seeking pretrial detention, the Government bears the burden\nof shouing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight, and that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions would reasonably assure\nher presence in court. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f); United States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d\n63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7).\n\n29. Where the defendant is charged with certain offenses, including\noffenses involving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, a statutory\npresumption arises “that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions will reasonably\nassure the appearance of the person as required... .” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). In\nsuch a case, the defendant “bears a limited burden of production—not a burden of\npersuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he\ndoes not pose a ... risk of flight.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o249\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020251.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel7/ of 25\ndetermines such release to be necessary for preparation of the person’s defense or\nfor another compelling reason.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(l). The defendant bears the burden\nof shouing that temporary release is necessary. See United States v. Scarborough,\n82l F. App’x 598, 6oo (6th Cir. 2o2o); United States v. Belardo, No. 2o Cr. l26\n(LTS), 2o2o WL l689789, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 7, 2o2o). This Court has not\nresolved whether it reviews a district court’s temporary release decision for abuse of\ndiscretion or clear error. See United States v. McCloud, 837 F. App’x 852, 853 n.3\n(2d Cir. 2o2l).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nl. The District Court Did Not Clearly Err By Denying Bail\n\n33. Judge Nathan did not commit clear error in finding, three times,\nthat the Government established by a preponderance of the evidence that Maxwell\nis a risk of flight and no bail conditions could reasonably assure her appearance in\ncourt. In three detailed, thorough decisions, rendered after hearing lengthy argument\nand receiving multiple rounds of briefing, Judge Nathan explained that detention\nwas appropriate in light of the nature and circumstances of the offense, which carry\na presumption of detention; the strength of the Government’s proffered evidence,\nwhich was based on multiple victims and contemporaneous documentary\ncorroboration; and Maxwell’s history and characteristics, including her substantial\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o25l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020254.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page2o of 25\n\nconcerns about her foreign citizenship or substantial assets (Br. 24-25), but Judge\nNathan thoroughly analyzed these assertions and, after multiple rounds of briefing\nregarding the efficacy of Maxwell’s proposed package, was not persuaded. (Ex. H\nat ll-l4; Ex. L at 8-ll). Maxwell atempts to compare herself to other high-profile\ndefendants (Br. 25), but Judge Nathan rejected the comparison, noting “crucial\nfactual differences” in several of these cases (Ex. D at 88) and making extensive\nfindings about the particular facts and circumstances of this case that make detention\nappropriate. None of this was clear error.\n\n2. The District Court Did Not Clearly Err or Abuse Its Discretion by\n\nDenying Temporary Release\n\n37. Maxwell also argues that she should be temporarily released—\nthough she specifies no end date—because she cannot effectively prepare her\ndefense under the conditions of her confinement. (Br. l3-l9). Judge Nathan did not\nabuse her discretion or clearly err by concluding otherwise.° To the contrary, Judge\nNathan has gone to significant lengths to ensure that Maxwell has adequate access\nto her counsel and opportunity to prepare her defense.\n° As noted, this Court has not resolved which standard of review applies to such an\napplication. The Government submits that the decision of whether temporary release\nis “necessary” is a mixed question of law and fact which, like the district court’s bail\ndetermination, should be reviewed for clear error. See United States v. Matis, 963\nF.3d 285, 29l (2d Cir. 2o2o). The Court need not resolve the mater here, houever,\nas Maxwell’s claim fails under either standard of review.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o254\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020255.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page2l of 25\n\n38. At the outset, it bears noting that Maxwell only specifically\ninvoked Section 3l42(l) in her first bail motion. (Ex. B at 5-9). Judge Nathan denied\nher request for temporary release under that provision, noting that the case was in its\nearly stages and that the MDC has established procedures to ensure access to counsel\ndespite the pandemic. (Ex. D at 89-9o). Nevertheless, Judge Nathan ordered the\nGovernment to work with the defense to ensure adequate access to counsel and\ninvited Maxwell to make further applications if the accommodations were\n“inadequate in any way.” (/d. at 9o-9l). Maxwell did not appeal Judge Nathan’s first\ndetention order. Instead, she repeatedly availed herself of the invitation to raise\nconcerns about her access to counsel, and Judge Nathan responded with significant\noversight of Maxwell’s conditions of confinement. (See Gov’t Ex. A). Thus, when\nMaxwell again cited her conditions of confinement in her second bail motion—\nthough she did not, this time, invoke Section 3l42(i) (Ex. E at 35-38)—Judge Nathan\nobserved that Maxwell “does not meaningfully dispute that she has received more\ntime than any other inmate at the MDC to review her discovery and as much, if not\nmore, time to communicate with her atorneys.” (Ex. H at 2o). And, again, Judge\nNathan made clear that she would “continue to ensure” that Maxwell has such\naccommodations as are necessary to prepare her defense and invited Maxwell to\nmake further applications. V/d. at 2o n.3). Judge Nathan continued to oversee\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o255\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020256.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page22 of 25\nMaxwell’s access to counsel, and Maxwell did not renew her request for temporary\nrelease in her third bail motion.’\n\n39. Under these circumstances, Judge Nathan can hardly be said to\nhave abused her discretion by finding that temporary release is not “necessary” for\nMaxwell to prepare her defense. “Temporary release is not warranted when a\ndefendant has had ample time to prepare his defense.” Scarborough, 82l F. App’x\nat 6ol. That is the case here. Maxwell is represented by a team of highly qualified,\nretained counsel, and has resources to prepare her defense far beyond those of the\naverage defendant. Maxwell has access to a desktop computer provided by the MDC\nand a laptop provided by the Government for Maxwell’s exclusive use to review\ndiscovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. (Ex. F at 29-3o; Gov’t Ex. A\nat l7-l8). Also during that time, Maxwell has access to email with defense counsel,\ncalls with defense counsel, and legal visits (depending on pandemic-related\nconditions). (Ex. F at 29-3o; Gov’t Ex. A at l8-l9). Maxwell currently receives\n7 Thus, to the extent Maxwell’s arguments about her ability to prepare for trial are\ntied to any developments since the time of her first bail motion—such as, for\nexample, the imminency of trial (see Br. l7)—this Court need not address such\narguments in the first instance. Cf. United States v. Hochevar, 2l4 F.3d 342, 344 (2d\nCir. 2ooo).\n\n8 In-person visitation at the MDC resumed on or about February l6, 2o2l. Atorney\nvisits are permited seven days per week. (Ex.

(Gov’t Ex.\nA at l8).\n\n4o. Given these accommodations, Maxwell’s argument amounts to a\nsuggestion that any defendant in a case with voluminous discovery must be released\non bail to prepare for trial, regardless of flight risk or danger to the community. That\ncannot be the law. Rather, “[i]n considering whether there is a ‘compelling reason’\nfor a defendant’s release under [Section 3l42(l)], a court must balance the reasons\nadvanced for such release against the risks that were previously identified and\nresulted in an order of detention.” United States v. Chambers, No. 2o Cr. l35 (JMF),\n2o2o WL l53o746, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 3l, 2o2o). Here, that balance emphatically\nfavors detention, given Judge Nathan’s repeated findings about risk of flight and the\nsubstantial accommodations made to ensure Maxwell’s ability to prepare her\ndefense.\n\n4l. The risks presented by COVID-l9 do not alter this conclusion.\nNot only does Maxwell have no underlying conditions that place her at heightened\nrisk of complications from COVID-l9 (Ex. D at 89-9o; Ex. H at 2l), but she nou\nhas been fully vaccinated (Gov’t Ex. A at l9, 2l).

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter to provide an update regarding the\ndefendant’s conditions of confinement at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) pursuant to\nthe Court’s Order dated August 25, 2o2o. (Dkt. No. 49). Over the past three months, the\nGovernment has had multiple conversations with MDC legal counsel regarding the defendant’s\nconditions of confinement. This update is based on information provided to the Government by\nMDC legal during those conversations.\n\nLast week, a staff member who was assigned to work in the area of the MDC where the\ndefendant is housed tested positive for COVID-l9. In response, the MDC implemented the same\nquarantine protocols that apply whenever an inmate has potentially been exposed to the virus.\nSpecifically, on November l8, 2o2o, the defendant was tested for COVID-l9 using a rapid test,\nwhich was negative. That same day, the defendant was placed in quarantine. As with any other\nquarantined inmate, the defendant will remain in quarantine for fourteen days, at which point she\nwill be tested again for COVID-l9. If that test is negative, she will then be released from\nquarantine. To date, the defendant has not exhibited any symptoms of COVID-l9.\n\nDuring her time in quarantine, the defendant will be housed in the same cell where she was\nalready housed before she was placed in quarantine, and medical staff and psychology staff will\ncontinue to check on the defendant every day. Like all other MDC inmates in quarantine, the\ndefendant will be permited out of her cell three days per week for thirty minutes. During that\ntime, the defendant may shouer, make personal phone calls, and use the CorrLinks email system.\nIn addition, the defendant will continue to be permited to make legal calls every day for up to\nthree hours per day. These calls will take place in a room where the defendant is alone and where\nno MDC staff can hear her communications with counsel.\n\nOn November l8, 2o2o, the Government provided the MDC with a laptop for the defendant\nto use to review discovery. During quarantine, the defendant has been and will continue to be\npermited to use that laptop in her isolation cell to review her discovery for thirteen hours per day,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o26o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020261.jpg": "CaSede2ol ep) o33o4AUNt SieeutreriZ72o 2Ailed l4/23/26 aragef 2 af 2\nPage 2\nseven days per week. Accordingly, the defendant is receiving the same amount of time to review\nher discovery and the same amount of time to speak with her lawyers as she received before\nentering quarantine. The defendant will not, houever, be permited to meet in person with her\nlawyers until she tests out of quarantine.\n\nAfter the defendant tests out of quarantine, she will resume the same schedule that the\nMDC implemented approximately three months ago. Specifically, from 7am to 8pm every day,\nthe defendant will be permited out of her isolation cell. During those thirteen hours, the defendant\nwill have access to a computer on which to review her discovery outside of her cell. Also during\nthe day, the defendant will be permited to, among other things, make legal calls, make personal\ncalls, access CorrLinks, and shouer. From 8pm to 7am, the defendant will remain in her isolation\ncell. The defendant will also be permited to have in-person visits with her atorneys up to three\ndays per week for multiple hours per visit. On days when the defendant does not have in-person\nlegal visits, she will have access to legal calls for up to three hours per day.\n\nAs was the case three months ago, the defendant continues to have more time to review her\ndiscovery than any other inmate at the MDC, even while in quarantine. The defendant also has as\nmuch, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to communicate with her atorneys, even while\nin quarantine.\n\nAs noted above, over the past three months, the Government has repeatedly communicated\nboth with MDC legal counsel and defense counsel regarding the defendant’s conditions of\nconfinement. Whenever the defense has raised a concern on this topic, the Government has\nimmediately contacted MDC legal counsel to inquire about and, where appropriate, to address the\nconcern. The Government will continue to keep those lines of communication open and will\nremain responsive to any concerns raised by the defense regarding the defendant’s conditions of\nconfinement.

(Dkt. No. 76). Over the past week, the Government has\nspoken with MDC legal counsel regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement and has tried\nto gather additional information regarding the concerns raised by the defendant, which the\nGovernment has shared with defense counsel. The Government has also conferred with defense\ncounsel three times regarding the same, as well as the defense’s request relating to MDC Warden\nHeriberto Tellez. The parties have been unable to reach agreement. Our respective positions\nfollou.\n\nThe Government respectfully submits that the Court should allou MDC legal counsel to\nrespond directly in writing to the Court and defense counsel regarding the concerns defense\ncounsel has raised relating to the defendant’s conditions of confinement. The Government\nunderstands that MDC legal counsel is prepared to submit a leter by this Friday, December 4,\n2o2o. Such a leter is the appropriate next step at this time, as it will allou the Court to hear\ndirectly from MDC legal counsel who can address the defendant’s conditions of confinement. The\nleter will allou the Court to ascertain whether further inquiry, including a personal appearance by\nthe Warden or other MDC personnel, is necessary. Moreover, the Government does not\nunderstand the concerns raised by the defense to implicate the defendant’s access to legal materials\nor her ability to communicate with her counsel. As noted in the Government’s leter dated\nNovember 23, 2o2o, the defendant continues to have more time to review her discovery than any\nother inmate at the MDC. The defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC\ninmate to communicate with her atorneys. (Dkt. No. 74).\n\nThe defense disagrees. As communicated to the Government, the defense’s position is as\nfollous: Warden Heriberto Tellez should appear before the Court to directly address concerns\nregarding Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement, which specifically target her.

Specifically, the defendant is permited to review her discovery thirteen hours per\nday, seven days per week.

Also during those thirteen hours per day, the defendant may use the MDC desktop computer\nto send and receive emails with her atorneys.\n\nThe defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to\ncommunicate with her atorneys. Due to the elevated number of COVID-l9 cases within the MDC,\nin-person visits have been suspended since in or about December 2o2o. While in-person visits are\nsuspended, the defendant has had regular video-teleconference (“VTC”) calls with her counsel. In\nparticular, the defendant has VTC calls with her counsel every weekday for three hours per call.\nIf defense counsel requires additional time to speak with the defendant, counsel may request to\nschedule an additional phone call on Saturdays as needed. All of these VTCs and telephone calls\ntake place in a room where the defendant is alone and where no MDC staff can hear her\ncommunications with counsel.\n\nThe defendant’s legal mail is processed in the same manner as mail for all other inmates at\nthe MDC.

(Dkt. No. 92). This update is based on information\nprovided to the Government by MDC legal counsel regarding the conditions of the defendant’s\nconfinement over the last two months.\n\nThe defendant continues to receive more time to review discovery than any other inmate\nat the MDC. Specifically, the defendant is permited to review her discovery thirteen hours per\nday, seven days per week. During the entirety of that time, the defendant has access to both a\ndesktop computer provided by the MDC and a laptop computer provided by the Government on\nwhich to review discovery. Also during those thirteen hours per day, the defendant may use the\nMDC desktop computer to send and receive emails with her atorneys.! This discovery review\n' Per BOP policy, all inmate emails are routinely purged every six months. In response to\ncomplaints from the defendant and defense counsel regarding prematurely deleted emails, MDC\nstaff examined the defendant’s inmate email account. That examination revealed that the\ndefendant had herself deleted some of her emails and had archived others. That examination\nrevealed no evidence to suggest that MDC staff deleted any of the defendant’s emails.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o276\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020292.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 76, o4/l9/2o2l, 3o8o288, Page2 of 3o\nAppellant Ghislaine Maxwell’s Reply in Support of Her\nMotion for Pretrial Release\n\nThe Government’s Response underscores why this Court should\norder bail for Ghislaine Maxwell so that she can prepare for trial.

This past weekend there\nwas a pervasive stench of sewage in Ms. Maxwell’s unit necessitating guards to flush pipes by\npouring water doun open drains in an effort to trap and disperse gaseous emissions. As guards\nexplained to Ms. Maxwell, there are three drains in the day area, and when the plumbing system\ngoes unused, gases escape from the drains and cause the stench. At times the stench in Ms.\nMaxwell’s isolation cell has been overwhelming due to overflouing of toilets in the cellblock\nabove. Due to lack of privacy, Ms. Maxwell refrains from using the toilet in the isolation cell\nand, as directed by the guards, she flushes frequently to avoid plumbing problems.

She is weighed while\nclothed on scales that are erratic and not set to zero; on at least one occasion, the scale was set\nabove five pounds. Her eyesight is failing, and her hair is thinning. The guards are far from\nqualified to assess Ms. Maxwell’s physical <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>.\n\nReleasing any inmate’s medical information (i.e., weight, vaccinations, etc.) without\ninmate consent is a HIPAA violation.

The guard responsible for the abuse is a member of a rotating\nteam that has been the subject of complaint, yet some members were reassigned to Ms. Maxwell\nfor the past two weeks. The incident at issue occurred when Ms. Maxwell was facing forward in\nfront of an officer whose back was in front of the handheld camera. On information and belief,\nthe camera was not recording at that time. The government disputes Ms. Maxwell’s claim by\nciting a video.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nDuring oral argument of Ghislaine Maxwell’s bail appeal before the Circuit, Ms.\nMaxwell’s appellate counsel expressed concern that she was improperly deprived of sleep while\ndetained in the MDC, an issue that has been raised in filings before this Court. In its brief denial\nof her appeal, the Circuit stated: “To the extent Appellant seeks relief specific to her sleeping\nconditions, such request should be addressed to the District Court.” See Exhibit A. We press our\nconcerns regarding disruption of Ms. Maxwell’s sleep and the deleterious effect sleep\ndeprivation is having on her health, well-being, and ability to prepare for and withstand trial.\n\nMs. Maxwell continues to be disrupted throughout the night by guards shining a\nflash/strobe light into her cell, claiming that her breathing must be checked. The myth that Ms.\nMaxwell’s conditions of confinement are related to her being a suicide risk was laid to rest\nduring the oral argument: There is nothing to support that contrived claim. In fact, Ms. Maxwell\nis classified with the standard CCl-Mh designation: inmate with no significant mental health\ncare. (See Dkt. l59 at 3.)\n\nContrary to the report that Ms. Maxwell “wears an eye mask when she sleeps” (Dkt. l96\nat 4), an item neither available for purchase through MDC commissary nor provided to her, she\nresorts to using a sock or touel to cover her eyes in an awkward atempt to shield them from\ndisrupting illumination every l5 minutes. Last night, she was confronted by MDC staff due a\nvisible bruise over her left eye. The “black eye” is depicted in Exhibit B. Despite 24/7 camera\nsurveillance (except when guards elect to exert authority in an intimidating way off-camera, as\nthey did in Saturday’s bathroom incident), no guard addressed the bruise until Ms. Maxwell, who\nhas no mirror, caught a reflection of her aching eye in the glean of a nail clipper. At that point,\nMDC staff confronted Ms. Maxwell regarding the source of the bruise, threatening to place her\nin the SHU if she did not reveal hou she got it. While Ms. Maxwell is unaware of the cause of\nthe bruise, as reported to medical and psych staff, she has groun increasingly reluctant to report\ninformation to the guards for fear of retaliation, discipline, and punitive chores. Houever, there\nis concern that the bruise may be related to the need for Ms. Maxwell to shield her eyes from the\nlights projected into her cell throughout the night.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2o348\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020349.jpg": "CaSede2ot ep) o33ouAUNt Bbeutent/25@2 lFited D479 /249Fldgef 2 Of 4\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

(/d. at l5). Judge Nathan therefore again concluded that Maxwell\npresented a risk of flight and that Maxwell’s proposed bail package “cannot\nreasonably assure her appearance.” (/d. at l6). Additionally, Judge Nathan was\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o365\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020366.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page8 of 24\n“unpersuaded” by Maxwell’s argument “that the conditions of her confinement are\nuniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and thus\njustify release.” (/d. at 2o). In particular, Maxwell did not “meaningfully\ndispute” that she has received more time than other inmates at the Metropolitan\nDetention Center (“MDC”) to review discovery and as much, if not more, time to\ncommunicate with her lawyers. (/d.).\n\nl4. Third, on February 23, 2o2l, Maxwell filed yet another bail\napplication, proposing two additional bail conditions. (Ex. I). After considering\nmultiple writen submissions (Ex. I, J, K), Judge Nathan denied Maxwell’s request\nin another writen opinion (Ex. L). Judge Nathan reiterated that detention was\nwarranted in light of the proffered strength and nature of the Government’s case,\nMaxwell’s “substantial international ties, familial and personal connections abroad,\nsubstantial financial resources, and experience evading detection,” and Maxwell’s\n“lack of candor regarding her assets” at the time of her arrest. (/d. at 7). Judge\nNathan noted, “If the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance, it would order her release.\nYet while her proposed bail package is substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable\nassurances.” (/d. at ll).\n\nl5. Throughout the pendency of this case, Judge Nathan has closely\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o366\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020367.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page9 of 24\nmonitored Maxwell’s conditions of confinement, including by ordering the\nGovernment to submit regular updates regarding that topic (see Gov’t Ex. A\n(compiling update leters and relevant court orders)), and by reviewing and\naddressing defense motions regarding Maxwell’s conditions of confinement (see,\ne.g., id. at lo-ll).\n\nl6. Maxwell appealed Judge Nathan’s later two bail decisions. In\nconnection with that appeal, Maxwell also moved for pretrial release pending appeal.\nAfter receiving briefing and hearing oral argument, this Court affirmed Judge\nNathan’s bail decisions and denied Maxwell’s motion for pretrial release on April\n27, 2o2l. (Mot. Ex. A). Responding to claims about Maxwell’s sleeping\nconditions that had been raised in her briefing and at oral argument, this Court’s\norder noted that any request for “relief specific to [Maxwell’s] sleeping conditions”\nat the MDC “should be addressed to the District Court.” (/d.).\n\nl7. At no point after this Court’s bail decision did Maxwell file a\nrenewed motion for pretrial release in the District Court.\n\nl8. Follouing the issuance of this Court’s decision, on April 29,\n2o2l, Maxwell submited a leter to Judge Nathan asking the District Court “to\naddress Ms. Maxwell’s sleeping conditions by directing the MDC to cease l5-\nminute light surveillance of Ms. Maxwell or justify the need for the disruptive\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o367\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020369.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Pagell of 24\nincreased stress of a high-profile case, and her sleeping situation in a cell by herself\nwithout acellmate. (Ud. at2). Third, the Government noted that the MDC would\nnot permit Maxwell to have an eye mask because such an item is not available in\ncommissary and is not issued to inmates. (/d.). MDC staff do, houever, permit\nMaxwell to cover her eyes at night using other items that are available in commissary\nor that are issued to inmates. (/d.).\n\n2o. In response, on May 7, 2o2l, Maxwell filed a reply leter\ndisputing the MDC’s explanation for the implementation of an enhanced security\nschedule for Maxwell and raising additional concerns regarding conditions at the\nMDC beyond Maxwell’s sleeping conditions but without seeking particular relief as\nto those conditions. (Mot. Ex. E). At no point did Maxwell file an affidavit in\nsupport of her claims regarding the conditions of her confinement.\n\n2l. On May l4, 2o2l, Judge Nathan issued a writen decision\ndenying Maxwell’s request for an order directing the MDC to modify its nightime\nmonitoring schedule. (Mot. Ex. B). In reaching this decision, Judge Nathan\nnoted that Maxwell’s claim that MDC staff was shining a flashlight directly into her\neyes and disrupting her sleep was “unsupported by affidavit or other factual\nshouing.” (/d. atl). Judge Nathan emphasized that all MDC inmates are subject\nto nightime flashlight checks and found that “there are a number of neutral reasons”\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o369\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020370.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Pagel2 of 24\njustifying the MDC’s decision to monitor Maxwell more frequently at night than\nother inmates. (/d.). With respect to eye coverings, Judge Nathan noted that the\nprohibition on eye masks “is a generally applicable policy,” but Maxwell is\nnevertheless permited to “use other non-contraband items to cover her eyes” at\nnight. (Ud. at 2). Judge Nathan concluded that “nothing in the record plausibly\nestablishes that current protocols interfere with Maxwell’s ability to prepare for her\ntrial and communicate with her lawyers.” (/d.). Consistent with the atention she\nhas paid to Maxwell’s conditions of confinement throughout the pendency of this\ncase, Judge Nathan instructed the Government and the MDC “‘to continue to ensure\nthat Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols” that are “necessary for\nher safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors, and consistent\nwith the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees.” (/d.).\nARGUMENT\nMaxwell’s Motion Should Be Denied\n\n22. This Court has already affirmed Judge Nathan’s orders denying\nbail or temporary pretrial release to Maxwell and accordingly denied her motions\nseeking such relief on appeal. The instant motion, which Maxwell styles as a\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o37o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020371.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Pagel3 of 24\n“renewed motion for pretrial relief,” is both procedurally improper and substantively\nmeritless. It should be denied.\nA. Applicable Law\n\n23. When seeking pretrial detention, the Government bears the\nburden of shouing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant poses a\nrisk of flight, and that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions would reasonably\nassure her presence in court. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f); United States v. Sabhnani,\n493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7).\n\n24. Where the defendant is charged with certain offenses, including\noffenses involving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. 8§ 2422 or 2423, a statutory\npresumption arises “that no <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> or combination of conditions will reasonably\nassure the appearance of the person as required....” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E).\nIn such a case, the defendant “bears a limited burden of production—not a burden\nof persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he\ndoes not pose .. . a risk of flight.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436\n(2d Cir. 2ool).\n\n25. Where the Government seeks detention based on flight risk, the\ncourt must consider: (l) “the nature and circumstances of the offense charged”; (2)\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o37l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020374.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Pagel6 of 24\n\nthe context of post-conviction bail proceedings, “given the findings that must be\nmade in order to warrant release, it is generally more appropriate that the motion be\nmade initially in the district court.” United States v. Hochevar, 2l4 F.3d 342, 344\n(2d Cir. 2ooo) (per curiam); see Fed. R. App. P. 9(a) (providing for appeals from\ndetention orders); cf. generally Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. l, 6 (l95l) (explaining,\nbefore passage of the Bail Reform Act, that “[t]he proper procedure for challenging\nbail as unlawfully fixed is by motion for reduction of bail and appeal to the Court of\nAppeals from an order denying such motion”). The Order Maxwell annexes to her\nmotion—an Order regarding security checks at the MDC (Mot. Ex. B)—ls not a bail\ndetermination, and Maxwell has not taken an appeal from that Order. See Fed. R.\nApp. P. 9(a) (requiring that a party appealing a detention order must file “a copy of\nthe district court’s order . . . as soon as practicable after filing the notice of appeal’).\nNo bail determination is properly before this Court.\n\n3l. In any event, Maxwell’s “renewed motion” is substantively\nmeritless. This Court has already held that Judge Nathan did not commit clear error\nin finding, three times, that the Government established by a preponderance of the\nevidence that Maxwell is a risk of flight and no bail conditions could reasonably\nassure her appearance in court. This Court has also concluded that Judge Nathan\ndid not abuse her discretion or clearly err in determining that Maxwell’s conditions\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o374\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020377.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Pagel9 of 24\nnightime checks involve shining a flashlight directly into her eyes (as opposed to\nthe ceiling), that the checks in fact disturb her sleep, or that the checks prevent her\nfrom being able to prepare her defense.*\n\n36. It bears emphasis that Maxwell’s appeal ostensibly concerns a\nmotion for pretrial release, such that the conditions of her confinement are relevant\nonly insofar as they affect her ability to prepare for trial. As this Court previously\nrecognized, the appropriate avenue for Maxwell to raise concerns about her ability\nto prepare for trial is through an application to the District Court. Maxwell availed\nherself of that process, but in so doing offered no evidence that the MDC’s security\nprotocols are unjustified or interfering with her preparation for trial. Tellingly,\n3 Maxwell repeatedly accuses the Government of making misrepresentations during\nthe course of this case. It is correct that the MDC informed the Government that\nMaxwell wore an eye mask at night, when in fact she uses other non-contraband\nitems to cover her eyes. The Government conveyed the MDC’s imprecise language\nin an April 6, 2o2l leter to Judge Nathan but has since recognized and\nacknouledged the inaccuracy. The remaining accusations, houever, are\nunfounded. For example, Maxwell takes Government counsel’s statement at oral\nargument about nightime checks being “routine” out of context when claiming that\nit involved some representation that all inmates experience flashlight checks every\nl5 minutes. To the contrary, when asked whether the nightime checks were\nconducted at that interval for every inmate, Government counsel clarified, “I can’t\nspeak to what is done as to all inmates.” Only after conferring with the MDC did\nthe Government convey to Judge Nathan, and nou this Court, the MDC’s procedures\nfor nightime checks of all inmates. The Government has and will continue to\naccurately represent the information it receives from the MDC when necessary to\nrespond to Maxwell’s complaints or inquiries from the Court.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o377\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020378.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page2o of 24\n\nMaxwell did not couch her most recent request to the District Court as an application\nfor pretrial release; instead, she sought an order directing the MDC to modify its\noperations or justify its procedures. In the absence of any evidence that the MDC’s\nprotocols interfered with Maxwell’s trial preparation, Judge Nathan acted well\nwithin her discretion in declining to order the MDC to alter its security measures.\nEven in so doing, Judge Nathan reiterated her commitment to monitoring Maxwell’s\nconditions of confinement and ensuring that they do not interfere with preparation\nfor trial. This series of events simply does not suggest that Judge Nathan abused\nher substantial discretion when denying Maxwell’s prior applications for bail or\ntemporary release.\n\n37. To the extent Maxwell nou raises new complaints about\nconditions at the MDC before this Court, such issues should be presented to the\nDistrict Court and reviewed by Judge Nathan. In any event, as was the case with\nher concerns about nightime security checks, Maxwell has offered no evidence to\nsupport her claim that these additional complaints are true or prevent her from\npreparing for trial. There is simply no evidence in the record beyond the bare\nassertions of counsel that MDC’s water is undrinkable, that the MDC provides\ninadequate food, that the MDC audio records legal visits, or that sewage overflous\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o378\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020383.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 96, o6/o2/2o2l, 3ll22o7, Pagel of l\nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\nFOR THE\nSECOND CIRCUIT\nAt a Stated Term of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, held at the\nThurgood Marshall United States Courthouse, 4o Foley Square, in the City of New York, on the\n2nd day of June, two thousand twenty-one.\nBefore: Pierre N.

No. 89. The\nGovernment did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. After\ndue consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions. The\nCourt's decision to adopt those redactions is guided by the three—part test articulated\nby the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir.\n2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the documents in\nquestion are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of the common law\npresumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing considerations\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o4o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020405.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Pagel9 of 9l\nmaterials under seal and proposed narrouly tailored redactions on those materials.

The\nCourt will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions after applying the three—part test\narticulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d\nllo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the\ndocuments in question are \"judicial documents;” (i) assess the weight of the common\nlaw presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access.

Nathan on\n5/l4/2o2l) (nl) (Entered: o5/l4/2o2l)\n\no5/l4/2o2l | 282 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2o2l, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell\nwrote to the Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with\nparticular emphasis on counsel's representation, unsupported by affidavit or other\nfactual shouing, that guards are shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every l5\nminutes at night. Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance\nin Maxwell's eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to\nprepare for and withstand trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the\nGovernment to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to\ncertain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff\nconduct flashlight checks of all inmates as a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As\nreported by the Government, inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing\nUnit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes. Inmates housed with others in the\ngeneral population are checked multiple times per night at regular intervals. The\nGovernment further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights are pointed at the\nceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in distress.\nAs the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP's\nflashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates,\nincluding that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential\nstress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that\nthese factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government\nalso indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable policy, but\nthat Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover her\neyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere\nwith Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.\nDefense counsel's May 7, 2o2l leter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances\nbut makes no additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the\nCourt urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be\nreduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to\nensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines\nare necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,\nand consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees. The\nGovernment shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for\nthe MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

Maxwell moves to suppress evidence\nobtained through a grand jury subpoena to a law firm involved in earlier civil litigation\nagainst her. She contends that because the documents sought by the subpoena were\npreviously subject to a protective order, the Government obtained them in violation of\nher rights against compelled self—incrimination, against unreasonable searches and\nseizures, and to due process of law. For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the\nGovernment did not violate Maxwell's constitutional rights when it obtained evidence\ncovered by a protective order in her earlier civil case. It further finds that Maxwell is\nnot entitled to suppression of any evidence or to an evidentiary hearing. The Court thus\nDENIES Maxwell's motions to suppress (Dkt.

Amodeo (\"Amodeo II\"), 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995)). The proposed\nredactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that the Defendant's submissions are\n\"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,”\nthereby qualifying as a \"judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the\nLugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995).\nAnd the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access ataches. Id. at\nl46; see also Nixon v. Warner Comme'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 6o2 (l978). As with the\nredactions to her renewed motion for bail, the proposed redactions here are narrouly\ntailored to serve substantial interests, including, most importantly, third parties\npersonal privacy interests. See Under Seal v. Under Seal, 273 F. Supp. 3d 46o, 467\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol7). See also Dkt. No. 95.

On December 8, 2o2o, Defendant Ghislaine\nMaxwell filed a renewed motion for releaseon bail. Dkt No. 97. In an Opinion and\nOrder concurrently filed under temporary seal, the Court DENIES the Defendant's\nmotion. In light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially confidential\ninformation that should not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the\nparties 48 hours to propose any redactions to the Courts Opinion and Order and to\njustify those redactions by reference tothe Second Circuits decision in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo(2d Cir. 2oo6). After determining which, if\nany, portions of the Opinion and Order should be redacted, the Court will file the\nOpinion and Order on the public docket. As a result, the Court concludes that the\nGovernment has met its burden of persuasion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and\nthat pretrial detention continues to be warranted. On or before December 3o, 2o2o, the\nparties are ORDERED to submit a joint leter indicating whether they propose any\nredactions and the justification for any such proposal.

ENDORSEMENT:\nThe request for an extension of time until May 2l, 2o2l to respond to the Court's May\nll, 2o2l Order is GRANTED. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on\n5/l4/2o2l) (nl) (Entered: o5/l4/2o2l)\n\no5/l4/2o2l | 282 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2o2l, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell\nwrote to the Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with\nparticular emphasis on counsel's representation, unsupported by affidavit or other\nfactual shouing, that guards are shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every l5\nminutes at night. Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance\nin Maxwell's eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to\nprepare for and withstand trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the\nGovernment to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to\ncertain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff\nconduct flashlight checks of all inmates as a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As\nreported by the Government, inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing\nUnit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes. Inmates housed with others in the\ngeneral population are checked multiple times per night at regular intervals. The\nGovernment further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights are pointed at the\nceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in distress.\nAs the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP's\nflashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates,\nincluding that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential\nstress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that\nthese factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government\nalso indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable policy, but\nthat Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover her\neyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere\nwith Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.\nDefense counsel's May 7, 2o2l leter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances\nbut makes no additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the\nCourt urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be\nreduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to\nensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines\nare necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,\nand consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees. The\nGovernment shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for\nthe MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

Maxwell moves to suppress evidence\nobtained through a grand jury subpoena to a law firm involved in earlier civil litigation\nagainst her. She contends that because the documents sought by the subpoena were\npreviously subject to a protective order, the Government obtained them in violation of\nher rights against compelled self—incrimination, against unreasonable searches and\nseizures, and to due process of law. For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the\nGovernment did not violate Maxwell's constitutional rights when it obtained evidence\ncovered by a protective order in her earlier civil case. It further finds that Maxwell is\nnot entitled to suppression of any evidence or to an evidentiary hearing. The Court thus\nDENIES Maxwell's motions to suppress (Dkt. Nos. l33, l39) (Signed by Judge Alison\nJ. Nathan on 6/25/2l)(Gw) (Entered: o7/ol/2o2l)\n\no6/3o/2o2l | 3o5 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: Pursuant to the Court's order of June 25, 2o2l (Dkt.\nNo. 3o3), any proposed redactions to the Court's opinion on Maxwell's motions to\nsuppress evidence must be filed no later than today, June 3o, 2o2l.

No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance in Maxwell's eyes is\ndisrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to prepare for and withstand\ntrial. The Court sought more information by ordering the Government to confer with legal\ncounsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to certain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In\nresponse, the Government states that MDC staff conduct flashlight checks of all inmates\nas a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As reported by the Government, inmates housed with\ncell mates in the Special Housing Unit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes.\nInmates housed with others in the general population are checked multiple times per night\nat regular intervals. The Government further reports that to conduct the checks,\nflashlights are pointed at the ceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present,\nbreathing, and not in distress. As the Government explains, there are a number of neutral\nreasons why BOP's flashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those\nof other inmates, including that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and\nthe potential stress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has\ndetermined that these factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The\nGovernment also indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable\npolicy, but that Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover\nher eyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere with\nMaxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.

Maxwell moves to suppress evidence\nobtained through a grand jury subpoena to a law firm involved in earlier civil litigation\nagainst her. She contends that because the documents sought by the subpoena were\npreviously subject to a protective order, the Government obtained them in violation of her\nrights against compelled self-incrimination, against unreasonable searches and seizures,\nand to due process of law. For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the Government\ndid not violate Maxwell's constitutional rights when it obtained evidence covered by a\nprotective order in her earlier civil case. It further finds that Maxwell is not entitled to\nsuppression of any evidence or to an evidentiary hearing. The Court thus DENIES\nMaxwell's motions to suppress (Dkt.

No. l42-l at 5. Under Annabi,\nSalameh, and Gonzalez, a statement that “the United States” agrees not to prosecute implies no\nrestriction on prosecutions in other districts.\n\nTwo provisions of the NPA refer specifically to prosecution in the Southern District of\nFlorida. The first states that the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida will defer\n“prosecution in this District” if Epstein complies with the agreement. Dkt. No. l42-l at 2. The\nsecond states that no prosecution “will be instituted in this District, and the charges against\nEpstein if any, will be dismissed” after he fulfills the agreement’s conditions. Maxwell contends\nthat the lack of similar language in the co-conspirator provision must mean that it lacks any\ngeographical limitation. If anything, that language reflects that the NPA’s scope was expressly\nlimited to the Southern District of Florida. It is not plausible—let alone “affirmatively\napparent”, Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672,— that the parties intended to drastically expand the\nagreement’s geographic scope in the single sentence on the prosecution of co-conspirators\nwithout clearly so saying.\n\nWithout an affirmative statement in the NPA’s text, Maxwell turns to its negotiation\nhistory. Under Second Circuit precedent she may offer evidence that negotiations of the NPA\nbetween the defendant and the prosecutors included a promise to bind other districts. See United\nStates v. Russo, 8ol F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir. l986). She alleges that officials in the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida sought and obtained approval for the NPA\nfrom the Office of the Deputy Atorney General and communicated with atorneys in other\ndistricts. Any involvement of atorneys outside the Southern District of Florida appears to have\nbeen minimal. Maxwell has already received access to an unusually large amount of information\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o764\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020765.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel47 of 2o8\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6 of 34\n\nabout the NPA’s negotiation history in the form of the OPR report and yet identifies no evidence\nthat the Department of Justice made any promises not contained in the NPA. The OPR report\nreflects that the Office of the Deputy Atorney General reviewed the NPA, but only after it was\nsigned when Epstein tried to get out of it. OPR Report at lo3. Other documents shou that\natorneys in the Southern District of Florida reached out to other districts for investigatory\nassistance but not for help negotiating the NPA. Dkt. No. 2o4-2. Nor would direct approval of\nthe NPA by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General change the meaning of its terms. No\nevidence suggests anyone promised Epstein that the NPA would bar the prosecution of his co-\nconspirators in other districts. Absent such a promise, it does not mater who did or did not\napprove it.\n\nSecond Circuit precedent creates a strong presumption that a plea agreement binds only\nthe U.S. Atorney’s office for the district where it was signed. Maxwell identifies nothing in the\nNPA’s text or negotiation history to disturb this presumption. The Court thus concludes that the\nNPA does not bind the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of New York.\n\nB. The non-prosecution agreement does not cover the charged offenses\n\nThe NPA would provide Maxwell no defense to the charges in the Sl superseding\nindictment even against an office bound to follou it.

From that day, Maxwell was held in solitary\nconfinement in the Brooklyn Detention Center. As COVID raged, the District\nCourt denied four bail applications and dozens of applications to ameliorate\nMaxwell’s deplorable conditions of confinement. By the time of trial, Maxwell\nwas so disoriented and diminished that she was unable meaningfully to assist in her\noun defense, much less to testify.\n\nAs trial approached, the vilification of Maxwell was unprecedented in both\nscale and severity. The bipartisan political pressure to obtain a conviction was\nenormous. Judge Nathan refused to apply the NPA to Maxwell in accordance with\nits terms and refused to dismiss the case as time-barred. She precluded Maxwell\nfrom presenting a meaningful defense by excluding evidence and argument that\nwas central to her defense, such as the NPA, the 2oo6 FBI investigation, the terms\nof the VCP, and the direct involvement of the complainants’ civil atorneys in both\nthe VCP and the Government’s investigation.\n\nThe trial itself involved the testimony of four women, three of whom (Jane,\nKate, and Carolyn), were permited to testify under pseudonyms.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.2 The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “‘deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

In that email, Villafafia\nalso noted that she was considering filing charges in the federal district court in Miami, “which\nwill hopefully cut the press coverage significantly.” This email received considerable atention l2\nyears later when it was made public during the CVRA litigation and was viewed as evidence of\nthe USAO’s efforts to conceal the NPA from the victims. Villafafia, houever, explained to OPR\nthat she was concerned that news media coverage would violate the victims’ privacy. She told\nOPR, “[I]f [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into\nthe courthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper,” and that such publicity\nwas less likely to happen in Miami, where the press “in general does not care about what happens\nin Palm Beach.”\n\nLefkouitz responded to Villafafia with a revised version of her latest proposed “hybrid”\nplea agreement, in a document entitled “Agreement.” Significantly, this defense proposal\nintroduced two new provisions. The first related to four female assistants who had allegedly\nfacilitated Epstein in his criminal scheme. The defense sought a government promise not to\nprosecute them, as well as certain other unnamed Epstein employees, and a promise to forego\nimmigration proceedings against two of the female assistants:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also\n\nprecludes the initiation of any and all criminal charges which might\n\notherwise in the future be brought against [four named female\n\nassistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate\n\nentity] for any criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal\n\ninvestigation . . . . Further, no immigration proceeding will be\n\ninstituted against [two named female assistants] as a result of the\n\nongoing investigation.\n\nThe second new provision related to the USAO’s efforts to obtain Epstein’s computers:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement\n\nresolves any and all outstanding [legal process] that have requested\n\nwitness testimony and/or the production of documents and/or\n\ncomputers in relation to the investigation that is the subject of the\n\nAgreement.

Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year conspiracy\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding recommendation for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\nsentenced in the state after he is sentenced in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be sentenced after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the resolution of all criminal liability, “and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she understood\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed.\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.'l3\n\nWith regard to immigration, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on immigration issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in connection with\ntheir immigration paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status. So there wasn’t any reason\nl3 OPR understood Villafafia’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry\ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to\ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l27o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021298.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l34 3536o38, Pagel26 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l24 of 348\nthe defense “[f]irst and foremost” reaffirmed the NPA and that Epstein “has no intention of\nunwinding the agreement.”\n\nOn December 7, 2oo7— the deadline set by Acosta in his December 4, 2oo7 leter to Starr—\nthe defense transmited to the USAO a one-sentence “Affirmation” of the NPA and its addendum,\nsigned by Epstein. !**\n\nF.

In one submission, 2o pages long, Lefkouitz\naddressed the “improper involvement” of federal authorities in the investigation and criticized\nVillafafia for a number of alleged improprieties, including having engaged in “unprecedented\nfederal overreaching” by seeking to prosecute Epstein federally, “insist[ing]” that the State\nAtorney’s Office “charge Mr. Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are\nsignificantly harsher than what the State deemed appropriate,” and requiring that Epstein plead\nguilty to a registrable offense, a “harsh” <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> that was “unwarranted.”!°°\n\nLefkouitz also argued that the federal investigation relied upon a state investigation that\nwas “tainted” by the lead PBPD Detective’s misrepresentation of key facts in affidavits and\ninterview summaries, leading the USAO to make its charging decision based on flawed\ninformation that “compromised the federal investigation.” Finally, Lefkouitz criticized federal\ninvolvement in the state plea process as a violation of “the tenets of the Petite Policy.” In a second,\nl3-page submission, Lefkouitz reiterated Epstein’s complaints about the § 2255 component of the\nNPA, arguing, among other things, that federal prosecutors “should not be in the business of\nhelping alleged victims of state crimes secure civil financial setlements.”\nia The Affirmation read: “I, Jeffrey E.

He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being sentenced, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence. On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls. Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try\nto take a further appeal in order to delay resolution of the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknouledging they had reached “the\nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While I am obviously very unhappy at what I believe\nis the government’s treatment of my client, aman whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize\nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost....

JUNE 2oo8 — JUNE 2oo9: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS PLEAS AND SERVES HIS\n\nCUSTODIAL SENTENCE\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia renewed her requests to Epstein’s local atorneys\nGoldberger and Black for a copy of the state plea agreement reached with the State Atorney’s\nOffice, noting that their failure to provide it was a material breach of the NPA. After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.”'”\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\nie The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

Finally, Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s purported “supervisor’—who as the\nFoundation’s vice president was subordinate to Epstein, the Foundation’s president—had\npromised to alert the Sheriff’s Office if Epstein failed to comply with his work schedule, but the\n“supervisor” lived and worked in the New York metropolitan area and was unable to monitor\nEpstein’s activities on a day-to-day basis. The Sheriff’s Office neither acknouledged nor\nresponded to Villafafia’s leter.\n\nIn March 2oo9, Sloman met in Miami with Dershouitz for, as Dershouitz characterized it\nin a subsequent email, ‘“‘a relaxed drink and conversation,” which included a discussion of the\nEpstein case. After that encounter, Dershouitz emailed Sloman, expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “assurance that the feds will not interfere with hou the Palm Beach sheriff administers”\nEpstein’s sentence “‘as long as he is treated like any similarly situated inmate.” Sloman responded:\n\nRegarding Mr. Epstein, the United States Atorney’s Office will not\ninterfere with hou the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office administers the\nsentence imposed by the Court. That being said, this does not mean\nthat the USAO condones or encourages the PBSO to mitigate the\nterms and conditions of his sentence. Furthermore, it does not mean\nthat, if contacted for our position concerning alternative custody or\nin-home detention, we would not object. To be clear, if contacted\nwe will object. Naturally, I also expect that no one on behalf of\nMr. Epstein will use my assurance to you to affirmatively represent\nto PBSO that the USAO does not object to an alternative custody or\nhome detention.\n\nA week later, Dershouitz emailed Sloman again, this time expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “willingness to call the sheriff and advise him that your office would take no position\non hou he handled Epstein’s sentence,” as long as Epstein did not receive special treatment, but\nadding, “[L]et’s put any call off for a while.”\n\nEpstein’s sentence required that he be confined to his home for a l2-month period\nfollouing his release from prison.

POST-RELEASE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nIn the summer of 2oo9, allegations surfaced that Epstein had cooperated with the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York’s investigation of investment bank Bear\nStearns, and that he had been released early from his l8-month imprisonment term because of that\nl85 In Florida, what is commonly referred to as house arrest is actually the Community Control supervision\nprogram.

When\nopting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision\nare communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files. USAM § 9-27.27o.\n\n2. USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°? The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist.

These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\ncrime.!°°\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8 U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)G@), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\nC. Case Law\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps:/(www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l327\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021364.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l9o | 3536o38, Pagel92 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9o of 348\n\nOPR asked Villafafia about these emails and about the tenor of her interactions with\nLefkouitz during the NPA negotiations and with other defense atorneys generally. Villafafia\nacknouledged that their tone was collegial and collaborative, and explained that generally, the\ntone of these emails reflected her personality and her commitment to complete the task her\nsupervisors had assigned to her:\n\n[I]f you were to pull all my e-mails on every case, you would find\nthat that is hou I communicate with people. I’m a Minnesota girl,\nand I prefer not to be confrontational until I have to be. And I can\nbe when I need to be. But my instructions from my supervisors were\nto engage in these negotiations and to complete them. So I felt that\ngiven that task, the best way to complete them was to reach the\nagreement and, keeping in mind the terms that .. . our office had\nagreed to, and do that in a way that is civil. So... although my\nlanguage in the kind of introductory or prefatory communications\nwith Mr. Lefkouitz was casual and was friendly, when you look at\nthe terms and when he would come back to me asking for changes,\nmy response was always, “No, I will not make that change.”\n\nVillafafia denied any intention to keep the victims uninformed about the NPA or to provide\nan improper benefit for Epstein, and she explained the context of the emails in question. The email\nin which Villafafia expressed reluctance to “highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and all\nof the other persons that we could charge” was writen in response to a defense proposal to include\nin the federal plea agreement the parties were then considering a promise by the government not\nto prosecute Epstein’s assistants and other employees. Lefkouitz had proposed that the plea\nagreement state, “Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also precludes the\ninitiation of any and all criminal charges which might otherwise in the future be brought against\n[four named female assistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity] for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” Villafafia told OPR that\nthe USAO was not intending to charge Epstein’s assistants and was not aware of anyone else who\ncould be charged, and thus did not oppose the request not to prosecute third parties. Houever,\nVillafafia was concerned that an overly detailed federal plea agreement would prompt the court to\nrequire the government to provide further information about the uncharged conduct, which might\nlead Epstein to claim the government breached the agreement by providing information to the\ncourt not directly connected to the charges to which he was pleading guilty. Villafafia was not the\nonly one to express concern about hou deeply a federal court might probe the facts, and whether\nsuch probing would interfere with the viability of a plea agreement. In an earlier email, Lourie\nhad suggested charging Epstein by complaint to allou the USAO more flexibility in plea\nnegotiations and avoid the problem that a court might not accept a plea to a conspiracy charge that\nrequired dismissal of numerous substantive counts.\n\nAs to Villafafia’s offer to meet with Lefkouitz “off campus” to resolve outstanding issues\nin the NPA negotiation, she explained to OPR that she believed a face-to-face meeting at a\n“neutral” location—with “all the necessary decision makers present or ‘on call’”— might facilitate\ncompletion of the negotiations, which had dragged on for some time.\n\nl64\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l364\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021369.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON OS 3536o38, Pagel97 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l95 of 348\ninvestigation.”47 Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of” Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?*\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,” or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\nans See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\n\n24 When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l369\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021373.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l99 3536o38, Page2ol of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l99 of 348\ndepart from the Ashcroft Memo. He told OPR, houever, that he did not recall discussing the\nAshcroft Memo with his colleagues and nothing in the contemporaneous documentary record\nsuggests that he made a conscious decision to depart from it when he decided to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Instead, it appears that Acosta simply failed to consider the tension\nbetween federal charging policy and the strong federal interest in this case, on the one hand, and\nhis broad reading of the Petite policy and his general concerns about “federalism,” on the other\nhand. OPR concludes that Acosta viewed the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\ntoo narrouly and through the wrong prism.\n\nFurthermore, Acosta’s federalism concerns about intruding on the state’s autonomy\nresulted in an outcome—the NPA—that intruded far more on the state’s autonomy than a decision\nto pursue a federal prosecution would have.”*° By means of the NPA, the federal government\ndictated to the state the charges, the sentence, the timing, and certain conditions that the state had\nto obtain during the state’s oun prosecution. Acosta acknouledged during his OPR interview that\nhis “atempt to backstop the state here[] rebounded, because in the process, it... ended up being\narguably more intrusive.”\n\nAcosta’s concern about invading the state’s authority led to additional negative\nconsequences. Acosta revised the draft NPA in several respects to “soften” its tone, by substituting\nprovisions requiring Epstein to make his “best efforts” for language that appeared to dictate certain\nactions to the state. In so doing, houever, Acosta undermined the enforceability of the agreement,\nmaking it difficult later to declare Epstein in breach when he failed to comply.\n\nOPR found no indication that when deciding to resolve the federal prosecution through a\nmechanism that relied completely on state action, Acosta considered the numerous disadvantages\nof having Epstein plead guilty in the state court system, a system in which none of the subjects had\npracticed and with which they were unfamiliar. Villafafia recognized that there were “a lot of ways\nto manipulate state sentences,” and she told OPR that she was concerned from the outset of\nnegotiations about entering into the NPA, because by sending the case back to the state the USAO\nwas “giving up all control over what was going on.” Villafafia also told OPR that defense counsel\n“had a lot of experience with the state system. We did not.” Epstein’s ability to obtain work\nrelease, a provision directly contrary to the USAO’s intent with respect to Epstein’s sentence, is a\nclear example of the problem faced by the prosecutors when trying to craft a plea that depended\non a judicial system with which they were unfamiliar and over which they had no control.\nAlthough the issue of gain time was considered and addressed in the NPA, none of the subject\natorneys negotiating the NPA realized until after the NPA was signed that Epstein might be\neligible for work release. Acosta, in particular, told OPR that “if it was typical to provide that kind\nof work release in these cases, that would have been news to me.” Because work release was not\nanticipated, the NPA did not specifically address it, and the USAO was unable to foreclose Epstein\nfrom applying for admission to the program.\n\n288 The Petite policy only applies to the Department of Justice and federal prosecutions. It does not prevent state\nauthorities from pursuing state charges after a federal prosecution. See, e.g., United States v. Nichols and State v.\nNichols (dual prosecution for acts commited in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building). Houever, in\npractice and to use their resources most efficiently, state authorities often choose not to pursue state charges if the\nfederal prosecution results in a conviction.\nl73\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l373\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021394.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 35o 3536o38, Page222 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22o of 348\ninformation about available services for victims.

The 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to “provide the victim with reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding .. . that involves the crime against the victim.”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult\nwith victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea\nnegotiations, and pretrial diversion. In particular, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views\nabout, prospective plea negotiations. Nevertheless, the 2oo5 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a conviction. Depending on the agency having custody of the defendant, the U.S.\nAtorney or other agencies were responsible for victim notifications during this stage.\n\nIV. USAO AND FBI VICTIM/WITNESS NOTIFICATION PRACTICE AT THE TIME\n\nOF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. USAO Training\n\nAs US. Atorney, Acosta disseminated the May 2oo5 updated Guidelines to USAO\npersonnel with a transmital memorandum dated February 27, 2oo6, stating that he expected each\nrecipient “to read and become familiar with the [2oo5] Guidelines.” Acosta noted in the\nmemorandum that the USAO had recently held an “all office training” addressing the 2oo5\nGuidelines and that new USAO atorneys who missed the training were required to view a\nvideotaped version of the training “immediately.” Acosta further noted that the USAO’s\n2lo GAO CVRA Awareness Report at 66.\n\nl94\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l394\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021433.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Page3 of 2l7\nSA-257\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 257 of 348\n\nabout the NPA because it was “confidential” and because the case was under “investigation and\nleading touards” the filing of charges. Villafafia recalled mentioning the conversation to her\nsupervisors and the case agents because she “thought he was somebody who could be of assistance\nto us and... could perhaps persuade Alex Acosta that this was a case that was meritorious and\nshould be prosecuted.”\n\nNevertheless, when OPR asked Villafafia why she did not inform Edwards of the same\ninformation that the FBI and she had provided to Wild in October 2oo7 and January 2oo8,\nVillafafia explained that she felt “prohibited”:\n\nAt the time that I spoke with him, you knou, there had been all of\nthis . . . leter writing or all of these concerns and instructions that I\nhad been given by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose\nthings further and not to have any involvement in victim\nnotification, and so I felt like that prohibited me from telling him\nabout the existence of the NPA.\nX. JUNE 2oo8: EFFORTS TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT THE JUNE 3o, 2oo8 PLEA\n\nHEARING\n\nThe Epstein team’s appeals through the Department ended on June 23, 2oo8, when the\nDeputy Atorney General determined that “federal prosecution of this case is appropriate” and\nEpstein’s allegations of prosecutorial misconduct did not rise to a level that would undermine such\na decision. Immediately thereafter, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that\nEpstein had until “the close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the terms and\nconditions of the agreement . . . including entry of a guilty plea, sentencing, and surrendering to\nbegin his sentence of imprisonment.” That same day, Villafafia made plans to file charges on July\nl, 2oo8, if Epstein did not enter his guilty plea by the June 3o deadline.\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia received a copy of the proposed state plea agreement\nand learned that the plea hearing was scheduled for 8:3o a.m. on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8. Also on\nthat Friday, Villafafia submited to Sloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior a “final final”\nproposed federal indictment of Epstein.\n\nVillafafia and the FBI finalized the government’s victim list that they intended to disclose,\nfor § 2255 purposes, to Epstein after the plea and, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia contacted\nPBPD Chief Reiter to ask him to notify the victims of the plea hearing. Villafafia told OPR that\nSloman said, “Chief Reiter could contact the victims from the state case, and tell them about the\nplea.”3°! On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform him that PBPD Chief\nReiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”?°?\n2a Villafafia further stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\nane Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n23l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l433\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021439.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document \"SA 963 3536o39, Page of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 263 of 348\nno federal charges filed against Epstein as a result of the government’s agreement in mid-2oo7 to\ndefer prosecution to the state.*”°\nC. July 2oo8: Villafaia Prepares and Sends a Victim Notification Leter to Listed\nVictims\n\nOn July 8, 2oo8, Villafafia provided Goldberger with an updated victim list for l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 purposes, noting that she had inadvertently left off one individual in her June 3o, 2oo8\nleter. Villafafia also informed the defense that, beginning the follouing day, she would distribute\nnotifications to each of the 32 victims and their counsel informing them that Epstein’s atorney\nwould be the contact for any civil litigation, if the victim decided to pursue damages. Finally, the\nleter informed the defense that the government would consider a denial by Epstein that any “one\nof these victims is entitled to proceed under l8 U.S.C. § 2255” to be considered a breach of the\nterms of the NPA.\n\nAfter exchanging emails and leters with the defense concerning the content of the notice\nleter, Villafafia drafted a leter she sent, on July 9 and lo, to nine victims who had previously\nretained counsel. The leter informed the victims and their counsel that, “[i]n light of’ Epstein’s\nJune 3o, 2oo8 state court plea to felony solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, and his sentence of a total of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by l2\nmonths’ community control, “the United States has agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of\nthis state plea and sentence, subject to certain conditions.” The leter included a reference to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 provision of the NPA, and although the defense had never agreed to it, used\nlanguage from Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein defense atorney Sanchez clarifying\nthe damages provision. The paragraph belou was described as “[o]ne such <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> to which\nEpstein has agreed”:\n\nAny person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an\noffense enumerated in Title l8, United States Code, Section 2255,\nwill have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she\nwould have had, if Mr. Epstein had been tried federally and\nconvicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing\nthis paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s\natorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to\nname... as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any\njudicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority\ndetermining which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet,\nshall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these\nidentified victims in the same position as they would have been had\nMr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.\n\nOn July lo, 2oo8, Villafafia sent Goldberger a ‘Final Notification of Identified Victims,”\nhighlighting the defendant’s obligations under the NPA concerning victim lawsuits pursuant to\nao As described in Section XII.G of this Part, the mater continued in litigation for years and resulted in the\ndistrict court’s February 2l, 2ol9 opinion concluding that the government violated the victims’ rights under the CVRA\nby failing to consult with them before signing the NPA.\n\n237\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l439\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021454.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Page24 of 2l7\nSA-278\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 278 of 348\n\n(e) If the offender is convicted, the sentence and conditions of supervised\nrelease, if any, that are imposed.\n(6) Referrals.

Consultation With a Government Atorney\n\n(l) In General. A victim has the reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the\nGovernment in the case. The victim’s right to confer, houever, shall not be\nconstrued to impair prosecutorial discretion. Federal prosecutors should be\navailable to consult with victims about major case decisions, such as dismissals,\nrelease of the accused pending judicial proceedings (when such release is for\nnoninvestigative purposes), plea negotiations, and pretrial diversion. Because\nvictims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government, and may disclose\nwhatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only\nnonsensitive data and public information. Consultations should comply with the\nprosecutor’s obligations under applicable rules of professional conduct.\nRepresentatives of the Department should take care to inform victims that neither\nthe Department’s advocacy for victims nor any other effort that the Department\nmay make on their behalf constitutes or creates an atorney-client relationship\nbetween such victims and the lawyers for the Government.\nDepartment personnel should not provide legal advice to victims.\n(2) Prosecutor Availability. Prosecutors should be reasonably available to consult\nwith victims regarding significant adversities they may suffer as a result of delays\nin the prosecution of the case and should, at the appropriate time, inform the court\nof the reasonable concerns that have been conveyed to the prosecutor.\n(3) Proposed Plea Agreements. Responsible officials should make reasonable\nefforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about,\nprospective plea negotiations. In determining what is reasonable, the responsible\nofficial should consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving\nnotice and considering views in the context of the particular case, including, but not\nlimited to, the follouing factors:\n\n(a) The impact on public safety and risks to personal safety.\n\n(b) The number of victims.\n\n(c) Whether time is of the essence in negotiating or entering a proposed plea.\n\n252\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l454\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021455.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Page25 of 2l7\nSA-279\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 279 of 348\n\n(d) Whether the proposed plea involves confidential information or conditions.\n(e) Whether there is another need for confidentiality.\n\n(f) Whether the victim is a possible witness in the case and the effect that\nrelaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.\n\nI.

The OPR did not\ncontain a finding as to whether the co-conspirator clause of the NPA bound other\ndistricts, although it stated that “witnesses” stated that the clause provided\ntransactional immunity and “found no policy prohibiting a U.S. Atorney from\ndeclining to prosecute third parties or providing transactional immunity.” SAl65.\nPANEL DECISION\n\nOn appeal, Maxwell argued, inter alia, that the NPA barred her prosecution in the\nSDNY by its express language.

Thank you.\n\n3 I have a few responses. The first is, although I\n\n4 greatly appreciate when the parties are able to reach agreement\n5 on the terms of a defendant's release, that agreement is\n\n6 meaningful to me but it's certainly not controlling. I\n\n7 ultimately decide hou defendants should be released. And there\n8 have been occasions where I've disagreed with an agreement\n\n9 between the parties. So the fact that you and the government\nlo reached agreement on certain terms, the terms that will be\n\nll imposed may be different than that agreement. It's simply, the\nl2 way that court proceeds. And the fact of the agreement - while\nl3 very helpful and I appreciate it, and it suggests that the\n\nl4 parties are working well together - doesn't necessarily mean\n\nl5 that those are the conditions that I'm going to impose.\n\nl6 The second thing to say with respect to the issue of\nl7 firearms is that it is in fact a policy. It's not a policy of\nl8 the U.S. Atorney's Office; it's a policy of our pretrial\n\nl9 service office, because they are going to be sending officers\n2o in to enforce the terms of your client's release, and, as you\n2l said yourself, the world is crazy, and they have safety\n22 concerns, which isn't to say that they have specific safety\n23 concerns about Ms. Noel. And, as you point out, this case is\n24 not a violent case and there are not allegations that your\n25 client has engaged in violence, either in connection with this\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l967\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021968.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Documentl4 Filed l2/l6/l9 Page lo of l2 lo\nJBJKNOEN\n\nl case or in her history, but I need to be concerned about\n\n2 sending law enforcement officers who work for the Court, who\n\n3 are going to be supervising your client, and it is for their\n\n4 safety that we impose that <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>.\n\na So I am going to impose the <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span>.

Instead, Thomas seeks\nevidence of staffing shortages, working conditions, the implementation of BOP policies,\nsupervisory lapses, and instances in which other BOP employees were not prosecuted so that he\ncan engage in atempted jury nullification by arguing that those conditions “led” to the criminal\nconduct that he is charged with and are a reason to acquit him.

Significant Entities and Individuals\nJeffrey Epstein was born in l953 and, prior to his arrest, worked at various jobs in the financial industry and\nultimately developed considerable wealth. On July 2, 2ol9, a federal grand jury of the U.S. District Court for\nthe Southern District of New York returned an indictment that charged Epstein with engaging in sex\ntrafficking and a sex trafficking conspiracy, in violation of l8 U.S.C. 88 37l, l59l(a), (b)(2), and 2. These\ncharges were based on allegations that between 2oo2 and 2oo5, Epstein paid girls as young as l4 years old\nhundreds of dollars in cash each for engaging in sex acts with him at his Florida and New York residences.\nThe indictment further alleged that Epstein also paid each of these minor victims hundreds of dollars in cash\nto recruit other girls to engage in sex acts with Epstein.\nOn July 6, 2ol9, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey upon his return to the United States\nfrom France and was transported to the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) Metropolitan Correctional Center,\nlocated at l5o Park Rou in New York, New York (MCC New York). Follouing a detention hearing on July l5,\n2ol9, the court ordered that Epstein be detained pending trial based on the court's finding that he was a\ndanger to the community and a flight risk.\nMCC New York is a federal administrative detention facility operated by the BOP that primarily provides\npretrial detention services for the U.S. District Courts for the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York.\nThe BOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2o2l due to substandard conditions that are\nunrelated to this investigation. When it was operational, MCC New York housed approximately 75o inmates\nat any given time. Prior to its closure, the majority of MCC New York’s inmate residents were individuals\nwith pending criminal charges (as opposed to individuals who had been convicted of offenses and were\nserving a sentence of imprisonment), but whom the court had determined under applicable law should\nremain in custody pending trial either because they represent a danger to the community, a substantial\nflight risk, or both. MCC New York has several different housing units. Epstein was initially assigned to MCC\nNew York’s general inmate population, but on July 7, 2ol9, he was moved to the Special Housing Unit (SHU)\npending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness of his notoriety\namong the other inmates. The SHU is a housing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely\nseparated from the general inmate population and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours per\nday, to ensure their oun safety as well as the safety of staff and other inmates.\nCorrectional Officer (CO) Tova Noel and Material Handler Michael Thomas began working together in MCC\nNew York SHU at l2 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9.4 During their shift, they each created and submited falsified\nofficial BOP forms documenting inmate counts (often referred to as “count slips”), and Noel completed and\nsigned more than 75 separate entries on an official BOP form documenting 3o-minute rounds (often\n* Noel worked her regular shift in the SHU from 4 p.m. to l2 a.m. on August 9, 2ol9, folloued by an overtime shift in the\nSHU from l2 a.m. to 8 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9. Thomas did not work his regular shift as a Material Handler ina\ndifferent location of MCC New York and instead worked an overtime shift in the SHU from l2 a.m. to 8 a.m. on\nAugust lo, 2ol9.\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23372\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023388.jpg": "Chapter 4: Custody and Care of Epstein Prior to His Death\nI. Epstein’s Arrest and Detention on July 6\nOn July 2, 2ol9, a grand jury of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York returned a two-\ncount indictment that charged Epstein with commiting sex trafficking and a sex trafficking conspiracy, in\nviolation of l8 U.S.C. 88 37l, l59l(a), (b)(2), and 2, based on allegations that he sexually exploited and\nabused dozens of minor girls, some as young as l4 years old, at his homes in New York and Florida. The\nindictment alleged that from at least 2oo2 through 2oo5, Epstein enticed and recruited girls, many of whom\nhe knew were underage, to visit his homes and perform sex acts in exchange for paying each girl hundreds\nof dollars in cash. The indictment further alleged that Epstein, working with employees and associates,\ncreated a vast network of underage victims to sexually exploit in New York and Florida by paying some\nvictims hundreds of dollars in cash each to recruit other minor girls to be similarly abused by Epstein. In\naddition to the two criminal charges, the indictment also contained forfeiture allegations, which sought to\nforfeit to the United States any property that was either used to commit or was a proceed of the charged\nsex trafficking offense, including Epstein’s New York residence.\nOn Saturday, July 6, 2ol9, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey upon his return to the\nUnited States from France. He was transported to the Metropolitan Correctional Center located in\nNew York, New York (MCC New York), where he was initially placed in the general inmate population. MCC\nNew York is a federal administrative detention facility operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). The\nBOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2o2l due to substandard conditions that are unrelated to\nthis investigation. When it was operational, MCC New York housed primarily pretrial detainees who had not\nyet been convicted of any offense, but whom the court had determined under applicable law should remain\nin custody pending trial either because they represent a danger to the community, a substantial flight risk,\nor both. Due to the significant media atention surrounding his arrest and his notoriety among other MCC\nNew York inmates, the follouing day Epstein was moved to MCC New York's Special Housing Unit (SHU), a\nhousing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate\npopulation and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours per day, to ensure their oun safety as\nwell as the safety of staff and other inmates. On Monday, July 8, 2ol9, Epstein appeared in federal court\nand pleaded not guilty to the charges. The court ordered that Epstein remain in custody pending a\ndetention hearing scheduled for July l5, 2ol9.\nAt the detention hearing, Epstein sought to be placed in home detention at his New York residence with\nelectronic monitoring and other conditions. The prosecutors sought to have Epstein detained at MCC\nNew York pending trial. The court reviewed the parties’ filings and heard argument on the mater of pre-\ntrial release on July l5, 2ol9. On July l8, 2ol9, the court ordered that Epstein be detained pending trial. In\nits ruling, the court noted that because Epstein had been indicted for a violation of the federal sex trafficking\nstatute that involved minor victims, there was a presumption in favor of detention under federal law. The\ncourt found that the United States had shoun by clear and convincing evidence that Epstein threatened the\nsafety of another person and of the community based on testimony from two victims, the allegations of\nrepeated sexual abuse of minors, and the lewd photographs of young-looking women or girls that were\nfound during an authorized search of Epstein’s New York residence in July 2ol9. The court also relied on the\nrecommendation of U.S. Pretrial Services, the seriousness of the offenses with which Epstein had been\ncharged, evidence reflecting Epstein’s harassment and intimidation of and tampering with witnesses\ninvolved in a prior Florida state criminal investigation, and Epstein’s lack of compliance with his legal\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23388\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023446.jpg": "follouing suicide watch and psychological observation, Inmate 3 asked Epstein not to kill himself while\nInmate 3 was his cellmate because Inmate 3 had a chance to go home soon. In response, Epstein told\nInmate 3 not to worry and that he was not going to cause him any trouble.\nWhen Inmate 3 left on August 9, he told Epstein that he would leave the clothesline in the cell so that\nEpstein could wash his clothes. Inmate 3 did not say anything about a noose having been in the cell, but he\nsaid there were five blankets in their cell when he left.\nC. Autopsy Results\nOn August ll, 2ol9, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, City of New York, performed an autopsy on\nEpstein and determined that the cause of death was hanging and the manner of death a suicide. One of the\noffice’s Medical Examiners performed the autopsy, and the autopsy report was reviewed by the First Deputy\nChief Medical Examiner. In connection with this investigation, the OIG interviewed the Medical Examiner\nwho performed the Epstein autopsy (hereinafter the “Medical Examiner’). The Medical Examiner told the\nOIG that the patern of Epstein’s neck bone fractures was consistent with a hanging. The Medical Examiner\nexplained that a different fracture patern is present if there has been a manual compression of the neck\nversus a sustained pressure like in a hanging, and the patern of Epstein’s neck fractures was that of a\nhanging. The Medical Examiner also said Epstein had petechial hemorrhages, which are pinpoint bleeds in\nskin, on his face and mouth. These hemorrhages are caused when the blood flou is obstructed and the\nsmall skin capillaries burst. The Medical Examiner additionally identified plethora, which is purple\ndiscoloration of the skin, and stated that both petechial hemorrhages and plethora are consistent with\nsuicide by hanging. The Medical Examiner stated that Epstein’s petechia and plethora were identified from\nhis neck up. In homicidal strangulations, according to the Medical Examiner, these conditions are normally\nfound only in the eyes and mouth, and in a different patern. Epstein also had, the Medical Examiner\nexplained, a marked and obvious ligature furrou that peaked upward which is consistent with suicide as\nopposed to a ligature strangulation.\nThe Medical Examiner further stated that there was no evidence of defensive wounds consistent with what\nis seen in victims of strangulation. The Medical Examiner told the OIG that in strangulation cases there is\ninvariably some signs of a struggle, even if the victim is impaired. The Medical Examiner noted that the\nautopsy did not identify any signs of a struggle. Epstein did not have any marks on his hands (no broken\nfingernails, no debris under the fingernails, no contusions to his knuckles) that would have evidenced a\nfight, and, other than an abrasion on his arm likely due to convulsing from hanging, no bruising on his body.\nWe also were told by the Medical Examiner that Epstein did not have strap muscle hemorrhages of the neck,\nwhich is bleeding in the lung muscles in the front of the neck. Nor did he have, the Medical Examiner told\nthe OIG, hemorrhaging in the muscles in the back of his neck. The Medical Examiner explained that you\nwould expect to see that hemorrhaging when there has been an incomplete compression as opposed to a\nsustained compression like a hanging.\nIn addition, the Medical Examiner determined that the cloth material of the ligature (noose) found in\nEpstein’s cell could have caused the fractures and superficial injuries the Medical Examiner identified during\nthe autopsy. The Medical Examiner also told the OIG that the ligature furrou was too broad to have been\ncaused by the electrical cord of the medical device in Epstein’s cell. The Medical Examiner said blood\ntoxicology tests were conducted and no medications or illegal substances were identified in Epstein’s\nsystem. The Medical Examiner stated that the ruling of Epstein’s death a suicide was the Medical Examiner's\n79\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23446\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023475.jpg": "investigation established both that Epstein’s mother was deceased at the time he asked to telephone her\nand that Epstein had been assigned the necessary documentation that would have alloued him to place\ncalls through the Inmate Telephone System, although he did not take the necessary steps to complete the\nsetup process that would have given him the ability to place calls through that system. The Captain told the\nOIG that when the Unit Manager was escorting Epstein from his atorney visit back to the SHU and Epstein’s\nrequested call was discussed, he told the Unit Manager that Epstein’s telephone call had to be monitored\nand logged.\nThe Unit Manager told the OIG that he escorted Epstein from his atorney visit to the shouer area of the\nSHU, where he connected a telephone into an unrecorded legal line and dialed the phone number provided\nby Epstein. The Unit Manager said that when a male answered the call, he handed the telephone to Epstein,\nand then left MCC New York for the day because his shift had ended. Before leaving the SHU, the Unit\nManager said he told the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Material Handler, and Noel, who were at\nthe SHU Officers’ Station, to make sure Epstein got his l5 minutes on the telephone, but he did not instruct\nthem to monitor the telephone call. The Unit Manager admited that he did not verify the recipient of the\ntelephone call, and that neither he nor anyone monitored or logged the telephone call as required.\nThe OIG found that the Unit Manager violated BOP policy by allouing Epstein to make an unrecorded and\nunmonitored telephone call, and by failing to verify the telephone call recipient, monitor, and log the call.\nWe further found that the Unit Manager exercised poor judgment when he left MCC New York while Epstein\nwas still on the telephone call that the Unit Manager had arranged and failed to instruct the Evening Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge, the Material Handler, or Noel to monitor the call.\n\nD. MCC New York Staff Failed to Conduct and Document Cell Searches and Eliminate\n\nSafety Hazards in Epstein’s Cell on August 9 Leaving Epstein with Excessive Linens\nin His Cell\nThe OIG’s investigation and review determined that MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU on August 9,\n2ol9, failed to conduct and document searches of Epstein’s cell in the SHU. BOP policy requires that BOP\nstaff routinely and irregularly search housing units.2° MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that SHU staff\nconduct at least five cell searches each shift during daytime and evening hours (7:45 a.m. to l2 a.m.), in\naddition to other searches of SHU cells and common areas, and BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post\nOrders require writen documentation of cell searches. BOP policy explains that the purpose of cell\nsearches is to, among other things, maintain sanitary conditions and eliminate safety hazards. To that end,\nMCC New York General Housing Unit Post Orders provide that when an inmate is transferred out of a\nfacility, all of the inmate's linens should be taken to Receiving and Discharge.\nThe OIG reviewed MCC New York SHU TRUSCOPE entries for August 9, and identified only one cell search\nentered by MCC New York SHU staff for the entire day. During his interview with the OIG, the Day Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge stated that multiple cell searches were conducted in the MCC New York SHU on\nAugust 9; houever, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge stated that he failed to document the cell searches\nwithin the TRUSCOPE system as required because he was too busy with other duties. The Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge further stated that any of the SHU staff could have logged the cell searches into\n86 BOP Program Statement 552l.o6.\nlo8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23475\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023476.jpg": "TRUSCOPE, but that it was primarily the SHU Officer in Charge’s responsibility to do so. The Evening Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he and other staff members did not conduct any cell searches\nduring his shift in the SHU on August 9. Additionally, the OIG determined that there was an excessive\namount of bed linen within Epstein’s cell. The Captain reviewed photographs of Epstein’s cell and told the\nOIG that the excessive linens were a security issue because they could give inmates materials to fashion an\nimprovised noose or use as escape paraphernalia.\nThe OIG found that on August 9, 2ol9, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge either failed to conduct the\nrequired cell searches or failed to document the cell searches that he conducted in the SHU, and that the\nEvening Watch SHU Officer in Charge failed to ensure that MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU\nconducted cell searches and himself failed to log cell searches in violation of BOP policy and MCC New York\nSHU Post Orders. Additionally, the OIG found that it was a performance failure for the Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, and Noel, who served as the SHU Officer in\nCharge during their respective shifts on August 9 and lo, 2ol9, to have permited Epstein to have an\nexcessive amount of linens in his cell.\n\nE. MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that the Institution’s Security Camera\n\nSystem was Fully Functional Resulting in Limited Recorded Video Evidence\nThis investigation and review revealed longstanding deficiencies with MCC New York's security camera\nsystem. These deficiencies resulted in nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU where Epstein was\nbeing housed to not record video starting in late July 2ol9 and continuing through the date of Epstein’s\ndeath on August lo, 2ol9. According to forensic analysis conducted by the FBI after Epstein’s death, on\nJuly 29, 2ol9, a disk failure in MCC New York's DVR 2 system caused approximately half of the institution's\ncameras—including nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU—to display only a live video feed with\nno video recording. MCC New York personnel did not learn of this system failure until ll days later on\nAugust 8, 2ol9. MCC New York personnel determined that the DVR 2 system needed to be rebuilt to restore\nrecording functionality. Despite the lack of recording functionality, this repair was not completed until after\nEpstein’s death.\nThe Warden told the OIG that he was generally aware that there were problems with the camera system.\nThe Warden sought and received approval from BOP to replace the entire camera system and in\nSeptember 2ol8, BOP entered into contracts totaling over $73o,ooo to purchase new equipment for the\ncamera replacement project. Although MCC New York management procured new DVR components\napproximately 9 months prior to Epstein’s death, the new system was not installed in a timely manner. The\nnew cameras required new conduit and wiring to be installed before the camera installation. Management\nfaced staffing shortages, temporary rotating facility managers, and other competing priorities that did not\nallou for completion of the installation of the wiring or the new camera system. The OIG determined that as\nof August 2o2l—nearly 3 years after MCC New York contracted for replacement camera equipment—the\nsystem upgrade still had not been completed.*’\n87 The BOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2o2l due to substandard conditions that are unrelated to this\ninvestigation and review.\nlo9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23476\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023497.jpg": "interviews with any prisoners who were in Mr. Epstein's SHU unit on the 9th floor on or about July 23\nor on August 9-lo, 2ol9 relating to Mr. Epstein, the same request for interview memoranda of any MCC\nemployee or independent contractor or any other person in the MCC midnight-8 AM August lo, 2ol9,\nany and all medical and EMS and hospital records from July 23 and/or August lo, 2ol9, and the future\npathology and toxicology and medical examiner's reports.

Defense counsel argued that they need the Court to help them find out the truth. | haven't\nlooked at the case yet, but counsel cited a case from Alaska writen by Judge Sullivan (not SDNY J.

(Again, | haven't looked at the case, but I'll find it and forward.) Defense counsel also\nasked Judge Berman to go to SHU at MCC and see the conditions for himself.

Many of the victims expressed anger at\nthe government and MCC for Epstein's death. Some of them seconded defense counsel's request for court\noversight in the investigation. Some bought into the conspiracy theories. Many of them asked for Epstein's\nco-conspirators to be charged & brought to justice.\nAt the end of the conference, Judge Berman did not dismiss the case. He simply thanked the victims and\nended it. | expect he will decide whether to grant the nolle pros and whether to get involved in the\ninvestigation at a later date, probably in a writen opinion.\nAnyway, | wanted to give an update while my notes were fresh.

As you likely knou, the\ngovernment had asked the court to grant their request for a nolle pros. At the start of the hearing, Judge\nBerman said he was using the hearing as an opportunity for the victims to be heard. He then gave the\ngovernment and defense counsel a chance to speak.\nMost importantly, defense counsel stated they were \"all for finding out the truth!\" To that end, they asked\nJudge Berman to oversee the investigation into Epstein's death. They claimed the Court has inherent\nauthority to find out what happened; this is an area of intense public interest and court supervision is\nimportant. Defense counsel argued that they need the Court to help them find out the truth. | haven't\nlooked at the case yet, but counsel cited a case from Alaska writen by Judge Sullivan (not SDNY J. Sullivan)\nconcerning a Senator for the proposition the Judge Berman had oversight authority/jurisdiction. Defense\ncounsel represented that in the Alaska case, the court appointed an independent lawyer to investigate a\nparticular situation. (Again, | haven't looked at the case, but I'll find it and forward.) Defense counsel also\nasked Judge Berman to go to SHU at MCC and see the conditions for himself. (Defense counsel\nobviously didn't knou that Adam & | give tours to his clerks every summer, although we don't typically go\nto SHU.)\nVarious atorneys for the victims spoke, too. One noted the \"timing of Epstein's death is curious\" and most\nof them seconded defense counsel's request for Court involvement in the investigation, although they\nadmited there was questionable authority for the Court to do so.\n\nPage l235\nDOJ-OGR-ooo24l84\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024353.jpg": "Re: Fwd: Bloomberg News - seeking information on Jeffrey Epstein detention\n\nFrom PEO |\n\nTo Lee Plourde, NYM/ExecAssistant~@bop.gov\n\nDate 2ol9/o7/lo o9:23\n\na ps Re: Fwd: Bloomberg News - seeking information on Jeffrey Epstein\n\nSubject: :\n\ndetention\n\nAtachments: TEXT. htm\nHere is the approved response:\nFor privacy and safety and security reasons, the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) does not release information on an individual inmate's\nconditions of confinement.

Follou-Up: Mr. Epstein arrived at MCC New York on Saturday, July 6, 2ol9. While conducting the lo:oo p.m.\ninstitution count thatevening/\"™ \"i\" ‘| Facilities Assistant reported she observed Mr. Epstein in his cell. In an e-\nmail she sent to Drs Bio | SEE fd Lieutenant\" ater that evening, she described Mr. Epstein as\n\"distraught, sad and a litle confused.\" She said she then asked Mr. Epstein if he was okay, and he reportedly said he\nwas. Houever, Ms. [Re |noted in her e-mail she was not convinced of this, adding, \"He seems dazed and\nwithdrawn.\" She went on to say, \"So just to be on the safe side and prevent any suicidal thoughts can someone from\nPsychology come and talk with him.\" Despite the fact that Lieutenar™”™ pened the e-mail there is no evidence\nthat he contacted the on-call psychologist as is required by P5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program. Additionally, if\nMs. Peo pas concerned about suicide risk, P5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program, requires her to maintain direct,\ncontinuous observation of Mr. Epstein. When[\"\"\"° _|opened the e-mail the follouing Monday morning, Mr.\nEpstein was evaluated by\"°\"\"™ at approximately 9:3o a.m.\nMr. Epstein was denied bail on Thursday, July l8, 2ol9. This was a significant disappointment for Mr. Epstein and\nlikely challenged his ability and willingness to adapt to incarceration. Given the potential impact of the judge's\ndecision, a psychologist should have assessed Mr. Epstein's mental status upon his return to the institution. The BOP\ndeveloped a SENTRY assignment of PSY ALERT for purposes such as this.\nSpecifically PSY ALERT is used \"to ensure, if movement occurs, that all staff consider the special psychological\nand management-related risks associated with the inmate.\" Furthermore, P5324.o7, SENTRY Psychology Alert\nFunction states, \"When a decision to move [any PSY ALERT] inmate occurs, any special psychological needs of the\ninmate are reviewed and considered by Psychology Services staff [and] any safety and security concerns are\nhighlighted for non-Psychology Services staff.\" Psychologists should use the PSY ALERT assignment more\nfrequently with high profile cases and with inmates who have a history or charge of sex offense. Both of these\ngroups of inmates are susceptible to exaggerated or unrealistic fears about correctional setings and experience stress\nassociated during movement and periods of transition (e.g., cell/unit changes, movement to and from court,\ninstitutional movement, and release of information through the media).\nMr. Epstein was reportedly in court on July 3l, 2ol9. It is unknoun what time he departed or returned to MCC New\nYork because this information was not entered in SENTRY. Regardless, upon his return, the United States Marshals\nService (USMS) provided R&D staff with a Prisoner Custody Alert Notice regarding Mr. Epstein. The notice\nindicated Mr. Epstein had \"MTL Mental Concerns Suicidal Tendencies.\" The USMS requested R&D staff sign the\nform, and they then departed with the signed copy. On August l, 2ol9, at 8:46 a.m., Def Dr fei, [an e-\nmail reporting she had just become aware of the above information. In the absence of additional information about\nthis notation, this should have been considered a referral to Psychology Services about a potentially suicidal inmate\nand procedures should have been folloued as outlined in P5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program. Specifically, when\na staff member becomes aware an inmate may be thinking about suicide during normal working hours, that staff\nmember must contact Psychology Services and maintain the inmate under direct,continuous observation until he is\nplaced on Suicide Watch or seen by a psychologist. There is no evidence Mr. Epstein was monitored under these\nconditions from the time he returned from court until he was seen by Dr. Bi, [or a suicide risk assessment on\nAugust l, 2ol9, at approximately l:3o p.m.\nInstitution Response: 7.

He was\nsmiling and did crack some jokes during the interview. He did elucidate some complaints and suggested being\ndisappointed with this writer as he wants \"to trust me and for me to trust him.\" He stated he remains unhappy with legal\nvisiting procedures as he cannot go to the bathroom as frequently as he would like to since he has a \"weak bladder.\"\nInmate Epstein also reported since coming to the psychological observation area, he has felt constipated and needs his\nColace. He had self-carry Colace in SHU, but since coming to the observation area, he has not had his medication.\nThis writer immediately notified medical and his pills were being processed during the interview. Inmate Epstein also\ncontinues to complain about the conditions of SHU confinement (i-e., feeling punished, smells, noise, and restrictions).\nHe does not exhibit\nsymptoms of any cognitive disorder, seizure disorder, psychotic disorder, or dissociative disorder at this time or in the\npast. Inmate Epstein denied any current suicidal ideation, intention, or plan. He reported wanting to be alive to fight his\nlegal case and go back and live life. He referred to himself as \"a couard\" and \"I'm Jewish.\" He said he is not the type\nwho likes pain or would ever atempt to harm himself.\nWhile on psychological observation, inmate Epstein has been eating his meals, sleeping and interacting with the inmate\ncompanions. He is in legal visiting the majority of the day and in the evenings. His log book and eating/shouer chart\nreflect the same. He has been speaking to inmate companions about investment strategies and about prison\nadjustment. Correctional Staff report during his legal visits, he is interacting with his atorney, animated, laughing, and\njoking.\nIntervention(s)\nInmate Epstein was provided with supportive and coping skills interventions today. He was receptive to them, but\nmostly wanted to express his complaints about his current prison confinement status and needs.

If any develop or change in intensity, inform your doctor\nas soon as possible. Only your doctor can determine if it is safe for you to continue taking\nXanax. Your doctor should periodically reassess the need for Xanax.\nSide effects of Xanax are usually seen at the beginning of treatment and disappear with\ncontinued medication. Houever, if dosage is increased, side effects will be more likely.\ne Side effects of Xanax may include:\nDecreased libido, drousiness, fatigue, impaired coordination, memory impairment,\nspeech difficulties, weight changes\n@ Side effects of Xanax XR may include:\nConstipation, decreased libido, depression, drousiness, fatigue, impaired\ncoordination, memory problems, mental impairment, nausea, sedation, sleepiness,\nspeech difficulties, weight changes\ne Side effects due to a rapid decrease in dose or abrupt withdrawal from Xanax or\nXanax XR:\nAnxiety, blurred vision, decreased concentration, decreased mental clarity,\ndepression, diarrhea, headache, heightened awareness of noise or bright lights, hot\nflushes, impaired sense of smell, insomnia, loss of appetite, loss of reality, muscle\ncramps, nervousness, rapid breathing, seizures, tingling sensation, tremor, twitching,\nweight loss\nWhy should Xanax not be prescribed?\nIf you are sensitive to or have ever had an allergic reaction to Xanax or other tranquilizers,\nyou should not take Xanax. Also avoid Xanax while taking the antifungal drugs Sporanox or\nNizoral. Make sure that your doctor is aware of any drug reactions that you have experienced.\nDo not take Xanax if you have been diagnosed with the eye <span class=\"highlight\">condition</span> called narrou-angle\nglaucoma.\nAnxiety or tension related to everyday stress usually does not require treatment with Xanax.\nDiscuss your symptoms thoroughly with your doctor.\nSpecial warnings about Xanax\nXanax may cause you to become drousy or less alert; therefore, driving or operating\ndangerous machinery or participating in any hazardous activity that requires full mental\nalertness is not recommended.\nIf you are being treated for panic disorder, you may need to take a higher dose of Xanax than\nfor anxiety alone. High doses--more than 4 milligrams a day--of Xanax taken for long\nintervals may cause emotional and physical dependence. It is important that your doctor\nsupervise you carefully when you are using Xanax.\nAs with all antianxiety medication, there is a small chance that Xanax could encourage\nsuicidal thoughts or episodes of euphoria knoun as mania. If you notice any new or unusual\n| symptoms after starting Xanax, call your doctor immediately.\n|\n| Xanax should be used with caution in elderly or weak patients, and in those with lung disease,\nalcoholic liver disease, or any disorder that could hinder the elimination of the drug.\no7/26/l7 Page 43 of 95 Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nhtp://www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/rxdrugprofiles/drugs/xanl49l.shtml 7/l9/2oo6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32233\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032329.jpg": "Date: 2/l7/o6 PALM BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT Page: 44\nTime: ll:36:35 Incident Report Program: CMS3olL\nCase No. .. . : l-o5-ooo368 om, Continued)\nwith Epstein s notepads marked Jeffrey Epstein we locate -\nschooletrans¢ript fron EB igh school a\n=? tS in the room, was the dresser /armoire where we located a\n‘bo 9F peach flavored Joy Jelly (Sexual Lubricant).
