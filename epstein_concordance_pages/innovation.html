Beyond duration of confinement (the quantitative\nmeasure of imprisonment), she was subjected to disparate treatment (e.g., long-term isolation and\nunusual restrictions and deprivation) amounting to a profound qualitative difference.\nPre-Sentence Detention Should Not Be Pre-Sentence Punishment\n\nConvicted offenders are sent to prison as punishment, not for punishment. Despite\ncomplaints made by Ms. Maxwell and her counsel, the MDC and BOP officials retained unchecked\nauthority to incarcerate her as they pleased on conditions that constituted unusual punishment for\na non-violent pretrial detainee who posed no threat to herself or others. Ms. Maxwell bore the\nbrunt of unusual conditions imposed by unfetered prison bureaucrats. The Supreme Court defines\n“unusual” as “something different from that which is generally done.”!® Under an original\nunderstanding of the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause (U.S. Const. amend. vi), “a\npunishment is cruel and unusual if it is overly harsh in light of longstanding practice.”!? Ms.\nMaxwell’s conditions of confinement were significantly and unjustifiably harsher than conditions\nin general population making it cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment. Follouing Ms.\nMaxwell’s arrest, then-Atorney General William Barr was intent on making sure what happened\nto Epstein while in BOP custody would not be repeated and issued directives to be applied\nexclusively to Ms. Maxwell.
