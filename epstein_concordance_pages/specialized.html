THE FEDERAL AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES\n\nA. The Department of Justice, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District\n\nof Florida, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nThe Department of Justice (Department) is a cabinet-level executive branch department\nheaded by the United States Atorney General. The stated mission of the Department is to enforce\nfederal law and defend the interests of the United States; ensure public safety; provide federal\nleadership in preventing and controlling crime; seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful\nbehavior; and ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice. The Department enforces\nfederal criminal law through investigations and prosecutions of violations of federal criminal\nstatutes. It also engages in civil litigation. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nDepartment had approximately llo,ooo employees in 4o components. The Department’s\nheadquarters are in Washington, D.C., and it conducts most of its work through field locations\naround the nation and overseas.\n\nThe prosecution of federal criminal laws is handled primarily through 94 U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices, each headed by a presidentially appointed (with advice and consent of the U.S. Senate)\nU.S. Atorney who has independent authority over his or her office but is overseen by the Atorney\nGeneral through the Deputy Atorney General.! The Department’s Criminal Division, headed by\nan Assistant Atorney General, includes components with <span class=\"highlight\">specialized</span> areas of expertise that also\nprosecute cases, assist in the prosecutions handled by U.S. Atorney’s Offices, and provide legal\nexpertise and policy guidance. Among the Criminal Division components mentioned in this\nReport are the Appellate Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the Computer Crime and\nIntellectual Property Section, and, most prominently, the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section\n(CEOS).\n\nCEOS, based in Washington, D.C., comprises atorneys and investigators who specialize\nin investigating and prosecuting child exploitation crimes, especially those involving technology,\nand they assist U.S. Atorney’s Offices in investigations, trials, and appeals related to these\noffenses. CEOS provides advice and training to federal prosecutors, law enforcement personnel,\nand government officials. CEOS also works to develop and refine proposals for prosecution\npolicies, legislation, government practices, and agency regulations.\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) (revised in 2ol8 and renamed the Justice Manual)\nis a compilation of Department rules, policies, and guidance governing the conduct of Department\nemployees. It includes requirements for approval by, or consultation with, the Criminal Division\n! Two U.S. Atorney’s Offices, in the judicial districts of Guam and of the Northern Mariana Islands, are\nheaded by a single U.S. Atorney. The Atorney General and the U.S. District Court have authority to appoint acting\nand interim U.S. Atorneys.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003308.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l32 of 348\nappeal an adverse determination by him within the DOJ. Ken [Starr]\nand I appreciate that you understand this and have no objection to\nour seeking appellate review within DOJ.\n\nStarr, Lefkouitz, and Martin Weinberg atended the March l2, 2oo8 meeting, as well as\nthe former Principal Deputy Chief of CEOS, who had joined the Epstein defense team.\nOosterban, Mandelker, and a current CEOS Deputy Chief represented the Department. The\ncurrent CEOS Deputy Chief told OPR that it was primarily a “listening session” with Starr doing\nmost of the presentation. Oosterban told OPR that he recalled “some back and forth” because the\ndefense team was saying “some outrageous things.” Both Oosterban and his Deputy Chief were\ndisturbed that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief, who had been an aggressive advocate for\nchild exploitation prosecutions, was supporting the defense position, although according to the\nCEOS Deputy Chief, the former Principal Deputy Chief gave only a “weak pitch” that was not\neffective.\n\nAfter the meeting, Starr and Lefkouitz made multiple writen submissions to the Criminal\nDivision. One submission provided a lengthy list of USAO actions that “have caused us serious\nconcer,” including the follouing:\n\n‘Federal involvement in a state criminal prosecution without any\n\ncommunication with state authorities”; !*\n\nthe issuance of legal process and document requests for items that\n\n“had no connection to the conduct at issue”;\n\nthe nomination “of an individual closely associated with one of the\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys involved in this case” to serve as\n\nthe victims’ atorney representative;\n\nthe “insistence” on a victim notification leter inviting the victims to\n\nmake sworn statements at Epstein’s sentencing; and\n\nthe purported existence of a “relationship” between Sloman and a\n\nlaw firm representing several of the alleged victims in civil suits\n\nagainst Epstein. '®\nl64 This complaint appeared to be at odds with Villafafia’s understanding that the defense objected to USAO\ncommunications with the state authorities. In November 2oo7, Sloman noted to Lefkouitz, “Your recent\ncorrespondence atempting to restrict our Office from communicating with the State Atorney’s Office . . . raises\nconcern.” In a March 2oo8 email reporting to CEOS about the state case, Villafafia noted that she did not knou\nwhether a state “misdemeanor deal [was] back on the table because the defense demanded that we have no contact\nwith the State Atorney’s Office, so I haven’t spoken with the [Assistant State Atorney] in over 6 months.” Villafafia\nlater reported to Acosta and Sloman that when Krischer complained to her that the USAO had not been communicating\nwith him, she explained to Krischer that “it was the defense who were blocking the channels of communication.”\n\nl65 In approximately 2ool, Sloman briefly left the USAO and for a few months was in private practice with a\nMiami atorney, whose practice <span class=\"highlight\">specialized</span> in plaintiffs’ sexual abuse claims.

Atorney Admission Rule 6(b)(2)(A) makes clear that\natorneys practicing before the court are subject to the Florida Bar’s Rules of Professional Conduct\n(FRPC). Moreover, the choice-of-law provisions contained within the relevant state’s rules of\nprofessional conduct make the FRPC applicable to their conduct.\nl. FRPC 4-l.l — Competence\nFRPC 4-l.l requires that a lawyer provide competent representation to a client.?°°\nCompetent representation requires the legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation\nreasonably necessary for the representation. A comment to the rule clarifies that the factors\nrelevant to determining a lawyer’s competence to handle a particular mater include “the relative\ncomplexity and <span class=\"highlight\">specialized</span> nature of the mater, the lawyer’s general experience, the lawyer’s\ntraining and experience in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer is able to give\nthe mater, and whether it is feasible to refer the mater to, or associate or consult with, a lawyer\nof established competence in the field.” The comment further notes that “[iJn many instances the\nrequired proficiency is that of a general practitioner.” With respect to particular maters,\ncompetence requires inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem.\nThe comment to Rule 4-l.l explains that “[t]he required atention and preparation are determined\nin part by what is at stake; major litigation and complex transactions ordinarily require more\nextensive treatment than maters of lesser complexity and consequence.”\nZe FRPC 4-l.3 — Diligence\nFRPC 4-l.3 specifies that a lawyer should act with reasonable diligence and promptness in\nrepresenting a client. A comment to this rule explains, “A lawyer should pursue a mater on behalf\nof a client despite opposition, obstruction, or personal inconvenience to the lawyer and take\nwhatever lawful and ethical measures are required to vindicate a client’s cause or endeavor.” A\nlawyer must exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but is not required “to press for every\nadvantage that might be realized for a client.”\n3. FRPC 4-4.l — Candor in Dealing with Others\nFRPC 4-4.l prohibits a lawyer from knouingly making a false statement of material fact\nor law to a third person during the course of representation of a client. A comment to this rule\nexplains that “[m]isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or\nomissions that are the equivalent of affirmative false statements,” and “[w]hether a particular\nstatement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the circumstances.”\nl99 See also 28 U.S.C. § 53oB(a), providing that government atorneys are subject to state laws and state and\nlocal federal court rules governing atorneys in each state where the government atorney engages in his duties.\n2oo The federal prosecutor does not have an individual “client,” but rather represents the people of the United\nStates.

THE FEDERAL AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES\n\nA. The Department of Justice, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District\n\nof Florida, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nThe Department of Justice (Department) is a cabinet-level executive branch department\nheaded by the United States Atorney General. The stated mission of the Department is to enforce\nfederal law and defend the interests of the United States; ensure public safety; provide federal\nleadership in preventing and controlling crime; seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful\nbehavior; and ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice. The Department enforces\nfederal criminal law through investigations and prosecutions of violations of federal criminal\nstatutes. It also engages in civil litigation. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nDepartment had approximately llo,ooo employees in 4o components. The Department’s\nheadquarters are in Washington, D.C., and it conducts most of its work through field locations\naround the nation and overseas.\n\nThe prosecution of federal criminal laws is handled primarily through 94 U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices, each headed by a presidentially appointed (with advice and consent of the U.S. Senate)\nU.S. Atorney who has independent authority over his or her office but is overseen by the Atorney\nGeneral through the Deputy Atorney General.! The Department’s Criminal Division, headed by\nan Assistant Atorney General, includes components with <span class=\"highlight\">specialized</span> areas of expertise that also\nprosecute cases, assist in the prosecutions handled by U.S. Atorney’s Offices, and provide legal\nexpertise and policy guidance. Among the Criminal Division components mentioned in this\nReport are the Appellate Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the Computer Crime and\nIntellectual Property Section, and, most prominently, the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section\n(CEOS).\n\nCEOS, based in Washington, D.C., comprises atorneys and investigators who specialize\nin investigating and prosecuting child exploitation crimes, especially those involving technology,\nand they assist U.S. Atorney’s Offices in investigations, trials, and appeals related to these\noffenses. CEOS provides advice and training to federal prosecutors, law enforcement personnel,\nand government officials. CEOS also works to develop and refine proposals for prosecution\npolicies, legislation, government practices, and agency regulations.\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) (revised in 2ol8 and renamed the Justice Manual)\nis a compilation of Department rules, policies, and guidance governing the conduct of Department\nemployees. It includes requirements for approval by, or consultation with, the Criminal Division\n! Two U.S. Atorney’s Offices, in the judicial districts of Guam and of the Northern Mariana Islands, are\nheaded by a single U.S. Atorney. The Atorney General and the U.S. District Court have authority to appoint acting\nand interim U.S. Atorneys.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4325", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004430.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l33 of 349\nappeal an adverse determination by him within the DOJ.

The\ncurrent CEOS Deputy Chief told OPR that it was primarily a “listening session” with Starr doing\nmost of the presentation. Oosterban told OPR that he recalled “some back and forth” because the\ndefense team was saying “some outrageous things.” Both Oosterban and his Deputy Chief were\ndisturbed that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief, who had been an aggressive advocate for\nchild exploitation prosecutions, was supporting the defense position, although according to the\nCEOS Deputy Chief, the former Principal Deputy Chief gave only a “weak pitch” that was not\neffective.\n\nAfter the meeting, Starr and Lefkouitz made multiple writen submissions to the Criminal\nDivision. One submission provided a lengthy list of USAO actions that “have caused us serious\nconcer,” including the follouing:\n\n‘Federal involvement in a state criminal prosecution without any\n\ncommunication with state authorities”; !*\n\nthe issuance of legal process and document requests for items that\n\n“had no connection to the conduct at issue”;\n\nthe nomination “of an individual closely associated with one of the\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys involved in this case” to serve as\n\nthe victims’ atorney representative;\n\nthe “insistence” on a victim notification leter inviting the victims to\n\nmake sworn statements at Epstein’s sentencing; and\n\nthe purported existence of a “relationship” between Sloman and a\n\nlaw firm representing several of the alleged victims in civil suits\n\nagainst Epstein.'®\nl64 This complaint appeared to be at odds with Villafafia’s understanding that the defense objected to USAO\ncommunications with the state authorities. In November 2oo7, Sloman noted to Lefkouitz, “Your recent\ncorrespondence atempting to restrict our Office from communicating with the State Atorney’s Office . . . raises\nconcern.” In a March 2oo8 email reporting to CEOS about the state case, Villafafia noted that she did not knou\nwhether a state “misdemeanor deal [was] back on the table because the defense demanded that we have no contact\nwith the State Atorney’s Office, so I haven’t spoken with the [Assistant State Atorney] in over 6 months.” Villafafia\nlater reported to Acosta and Sloman that when Krischer complained to her that the USAO had not been communicating\nwith him, she explained to Krischer that “it was the defense who were blocking the channels of communication.”\n\nl65 In approximately 2ool, Sloman briefly left the USAO and for a few months was in private practice with a\nMiami atorney, whose practice <span class=\"highlight\">specialized</span> in plaintiffs’ sexual abuse claims.

Atorney Admission Rule 6(b)(2)(A) makes clear that\natorneys practicing before the court are subject to the Florida Bar’s Rules of Professional Conduct\n(FRPC).

FRPC 4-l.l — Competence\nFRPC 4-l.l requires that a lawyer provide competent representation to a client.?°°\nCompetent representation requires the legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation\nreasonably necessary for the representation. A comment to the rule clarifies that the factors\nrelevant to determining a lawyer’s competence to handle a particular mater include “the relative\ncomplexity and <span class=\"highlight\">specialized</span> nature of the mater, the lawyer’s general experience, the lawyer’s\ntraining and experience in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer is able to give\nthe mater, and whether it is feasible to refer the mater to, or associate or consult with, a lawyer\nof established competence in the field.” The comment further notes that “[i]n many instances the\nrequired proficiency is that of a general practitioner.” With respect to particular maters,\ncompetence requires inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem.\nThe comment to Rule 4-l.l explains that “[t]he required atention and preparation are determined\nin part by what is at stake; major litigation and complex transactions ordinarily require more\nextensive treatment than maters of lesser complexity and consequence.”\nZe FRPC 4-l.3 — Diligence\nFRPC 4-l.3 specifies that a lawyer should act with reasonable diligence and promptness in\nrepresenting a client. A comment to this rule explains, “A lawyer should pursue a mater on behalf\nof a client despite opposition, obstruction, or personal inconvenience to the lawyer and take\nwhatever lawful and ethical measures are required to vindicate a client’s cause or endeavor.” A\nlawyer must exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but is not required “to press for every\nadvantage that might be realized for a client.”\n3. FRPC 4-4.l — Candor in Dealing with Others\nFRPC 4-4.l prohibits a lawyer from knouingly making a false statement of material fact\nor law to a third person during the course of representation of a client. A comment to this rule\nexplains that “[m]isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or\nomissions that are the equivalent of affirmative false statements,” and “[w]hether a particular\nstatement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the circumstances.”\nl99 See also 28 U.S.C. § 53oB(a), providing that government atorneys are subject to state laws and state and\nlocal federal court rules governing atorneys in each state where the government atorney engages in his duties.\n2oo The federal prosecutor does not have an individual “client,” but rather represents the people of the United\nStates.

EXHIBIT l. Although the\ngovernment says that Rocchio is a “clinical instructor of psychiatry and human behavior,” the\ngovernment’s notice does not say in what specialty it proposes this Court endorse her. /d. at l-3.\n\nInstead, the government broadly asserts that Rocchio has “treated patients with trauma,\nincluding sexual trauma in childhood and adolescence,” has “received <span class=\"highlight\">specialized</span> training in\ntraumatic stress, sexual abuse, and clinical and forensic psychology,” and has “writen,\npresented, and taught about the assessment and treatment of trauma, among other topics.” /d. at\nl-2.\n\nAccording to the government, Rocchio intends to testify on the follouing topics:\n\nIndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by perpetrators of\n\nsexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\n\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is\n\ndeveloped over time, rather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are\n\noften subject to a strategic patern of behaviors, often called grooming, that can take\n\na variety of forms and function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure\n\nthe nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment with their abuser. The\n\nrelationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from being aware that what\n\nthey are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore\n\nmay not identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not\n\nrecognize the consequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation\n\nand abuse can increase the likelihood of victimization later in life and can result in\n\nlong-term traumatic and psychological consequences, especially when it occurs in\n\nthe context of complex trauma. The presence of other individuals can facilitate the\n\nsexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that nondisclosure,\n\nincremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\n\na variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events\n\nis impacted by a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the\n\ntrauma. Dr. Rocchio has not evaluated any specific victim in this case, and the\n3 Daubert v.

Rocchio’s proposed testimony is inadmissible.\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 7o2 governs the admissibility of Rocchio’s proposed testimony.\nThat rule says:\n\nA witness who is qualified as an expert by knouledge, skill, experience, training,\n\nor education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:\n\n(a) the expert’s scientific, technical, or other <span class=\"highlight\">specialized</span> knouledge will help the\n\ntrier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;\n\n(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;\n\n(c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and\n\n(d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the\n\ncase.\nFed. R. Evid. 7o2.\n\nRule 7o2 charges district courts “with ‘the task of ensuring that an expert’s testimony\nboth rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.’” Amorgianos v. Nat’l R_R.\nPassenger Corp., 3o3 F.3d 256, 265 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (quoting Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 597); see Fed.\nR. Evid. 4ol & 4o2.

Carmichael, 526\nU.S. l37, l52 (l999)). “To decide ‘whether a step in an expert’s analysis is unreliable, the\ndistrict court should undertake a rigorous examination of the facts on which the expert relies, the\nmethod by which the expert draws an opinion from those facts, and hou the expert applies the\nfacts and methods to the case at hand.’” Electra v. 59 Murray Enterprises, Inc., 987 F.3d 233,\n254 (2d Cir. 2o2l) (quoting Amorgianos, 3o3 F.3d at 267). If an expert’s opinions rest “on data,\na methodology, or studies that are simply inadequate to support the conclusions reached,\nDaubert and Rule 7o2 mandate the exclusion of that unreliable opinion testimony.” Amorgianos,\n3o3 F.3d at 266.\n\nThe Supreme Court in Daubert set forth several factors for the court to consider in\ndetermining reliability: “(l) whether a theory or technique can be (and has been) tested; (2)\nwhether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review and publication; (3) a\ntechnique’s knoun or potential rate of error, and the existence and maintenance of standards\ncontrolling the technique’s operation; and (4) whether a particular technique or theory has gained\n‘general acceptance’ in the relevant scientific community” Amorgianos, 3o3 F.3d at 266 (cleaned\nup). “Rule [7o2] applies its reliability standard to all ‘scientific,’ ‘technical,’ or ‘other\n<span class=\"highlight\">specialized</span>’ maters within its scope.” Kumho Tire, 526 U.S. at l47-48.\n\nAssuming an expert’s opinions clear the relevancy and reliability hurdles of Daubert and\nRule 7o2, the court must nevertheless exclude the evidence if it violates Rule 7o4, Rule 4o3, or\nRule 4o4. Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 595.\n\nRule 7o4 provides that “[iJn a criminal case, an expert witness must not state an opinion\nabout whether the defendant did or did not have a mental state or condition that constitutes an\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5633", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005643.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Pagel9 of 24\n\nRather, Rocchio’s testimony will serve only to inflame and passions and emotions of the\njury, prejudicing Ms. Maxwell, and to distract and mislead the jury from its constitutional\nobligation of holding the government to its burden of proof.

Figueroa, 6l8\nF.2d 934, 943 (2d Cir. l98o) (evidence is unfairly prejudicial “when it tends to have some\nadverse effect upon a defendant beyond tending to prove the fact or issue that justified its\nadmission into evidence.

This court should exclude Rocchio’s third proffered opinion.\n\nD. Opinion 4: The presence of other individuals can facilitate the sexual\n\nabuse of minors.\n\nRocchio’s fourth opinion—that the presence of other individuals can facilitate the sexual\nabuse of minors—is not properly admited as expert opinion.

Another important issue is to investigate what sort\nof training programs or materials need to be developed so that a wide vari-\nety of professionals can faithfully implement the definition and proposed\nassessment methods.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nCurrently there is no consensus regarding hou to define grooming. In addi-\ntion, there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred. or\nis occurring. The field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about\nkey issues such as the interrater reliability of these judgments or the error\nrates of these judgments including the frequency of false negatives or false\npositives. Thus currently it appears that grooming is not a construct that\nought to be used in forensic setings as it does not meet some of the cri-\nteria in the Daubert standard. The Daubert standard indicates that in court\nan expert witness may only testify if (a) “the expert’s scientific, technical,\nor other <span class=\"highlight\">specialized</span> knouledge will help the trier of fact to understand the\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based on suffi-\ncient facts or data; (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and\nmethods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and meth-\nods to the facts of the case” (Rule 7o2: Testimony by expert witness). Right\nnou it does not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and\nmethods” to define and detect grooming.\n\nWe propose a definition of grooming that involves two parts: (a) inap-\npropriate behavior on the part of the adult and (b) sound arguments that this\ninappropriate behavior functions to increase the probability of future sexual\nabuse. We then provide exemplars of this kind of inappropriate behavior.\nFuture research on grooming would be more useful to the field if data were\ncollected using a single, clear definition such as the one we have proposed.\nThis would provide a basis for data to be easily aggregated and beter under-\nstood, which could lead to the admissibility of grooming evidence in forensic\nsetings. Furthermore, we are currently working to develop valid psycho-\nmetric instruments with knoun reliability and validity to assess grooming\naccording to this standard.\n\nREFERENCES\nl8 USC § 2252A.

Hindsight bias\nrefers to the tendency to overestimate hou predictable or foreseeable an event is after being\ninformed about the outcome of an event. Simply put, knouledge of the outcome of the event, i.e.\nEpstein pleaded guilty to having sexual contact with post-pubescent minors, makes the\nimportance of pre-conviction behaviors obvious. Retrospective judgments about the\npredictability or foreseeability of the outcome are systemically inflated or biased compared to\njudgments made without information about the outcome. Hindsight bias refers to the tendency to\noverestimate hou predictable an event is after learning the outcome of the event (Fischhoff,\nl975). For example, after a political election, people believe their pre-election estimates of the\noutcome were closer to the outcome than they actually were (Blank, Fischer, & Erdfelder, 2oo3).\nHindsight bias has been discussed in over 8oo scholarly articles across a variety of different\ndomains including medicine, financial decision making, consumer satisfaction, and within the\nlegal domain (see Roese & Vohs, 2ol2; Arkes, 2ol3; Strohmaier et al., 2o2l) and using a variety\nof different experimental designs (Pohl & Erdfelder, 2ol6) and a variety of different stimuli such\nas writen vignetes, visual stimuli (e.g., Bernstein & Harley, 2oo7), and auditory stimuli (e.g.,\nBernstein, Wilson, Pernat, & Meilleur, 2ol2). Even individuals with <span class=\"highlight\">specialized</span> training and\nexpertise succumb to hindsight bias (Musch & Wagner, 2oo7). One notable study detected\nhindsight bias among actual judges making civil liability decisions, in which judges with\noutcome knouledge perceived the harm to be significantly more foreseeable than judges who did\nnot receive outcome information and were thus more likely to render a finding of negligence\n(Oeberst & Goeckenjan, 2ol6). Another notable study detected hindsight bias in a sample of\nmental health professionals who gauged the dangerousness of a psychiatric patient; again,\noutcome knouledge affected the reported dangerousness and predictably of harm posed by the\npatient (Beltrani et al., 2ol8).\n\nHindsight bias affects legal judgments. Civil or criminal prosecutions related to events\noccurring decades ago may be compromised by this bias in many ways, from the investigation—\neither ignoring evidence or atributing significance in hindsight—through the presentation of\nevidence, to the deliberation of any factfinder. Awareness of the impact of the hindsight bias\nshould temper any claims that so called “grooming” behaviors should have been noticed and\neither reported or avoided and that failing to do so constitutes knouledge or intent.\n\nc.

The Halo effect is\na cognitive bias in impression formation whereby the positive evaluation of one characteristic\nhas a radiating effect on hou other, non-related characteristics of the individual are evaluated.\nFor example, one classic study found that physical atractiveness influenced evaluations of the\ntarget's personality, life satisfaction, and expected future personal and occupational success —\ndespite the fact that no information about any of these atributes was provided (Dion et al.,\n\nl972). Physical atractiveness has also been found to influence culpability judgments, with\n\natractive individuals being held less-responsible than unatractive individuals (Dion, l972;\n\nEfran, l974). Halo effects have been found to be cued by factors other than atractiveness, such\n\nas the described status of the target (Wilson, l968), the name of the target (Harari & McDavid,\n\nl973), and even one's mood when evaluating the target (Forgas, 2oll).

Hindsight bias\nrefers to the tendency to overestimate hou predictable or foreseeable an event is after being\ninformed about the outcome of an event. Simply put, knouledge of the outcome of the event, i.e.\nEpstein pleaded guilty to having sexual contact with post-pubescent minors, makes the\nimportance of pre-conviction behaviors obvious. Retrospective judgments about the\npredictability or foreseeability of the outcome are systemically inflated or biased compared to\njudgments made without information about the outcome. Hindsight bias refers to the tendency to\noverestimate hou predictable an event is after learning the outcome of the event (Fischhoff,\nl975). For example, after a political election, people believe their pre-election estimates of the\noutcome were closer to the outcome than they actually were (Blank, Fischer, & Erdfelder, 2oo3).\nHindsight bias has been discussed in over 8oo scholarly articles across a variety of different\ndomains including medicine, financial decision making, consumer satisfaction, and within the\nlegal domain (see Roese & Vohs, 2ol2; Arkes, 2ol3; Strohmaier et al., 2o2l) and using a variety\nof different experimental designs (Pohl & Erdfelder, 2ol6) and a variety of different stimuli such\nas writen vignetes, visual stimuli (e.g., Bernstein & Harley, 2oo7), and auditory stimuli (e.g.,\nBernstein, Wilson, Pernat, & Meilleur, 2ol2). Even individuals with <span class=\"highlight\">specialized</span> training and\nexpertise succumb to hindsight bias (Musch & Wagner, 2oo7). One notable study detected\nhindsight bias among actual judges making civil liability decisions, in which judges with\noutcome knouledge perceived the harm to be significantly more foreseeable than judges who did\nnot receive outcome information and were thus more likely to render a finding of negligence\n(Oeberst & Goeckenjan, 2ol6). Another notable study detected hindsight bias in a sample of\nmental health professionals who gauged the dangerousness of a psychiatric patient; again,\noutcome knouledge affected the reported dangerousness and predictably of harm posed by the\npatient (Beltrani et al., 2ol8).\n\nHindsight bias affects legal judgments. Civil or criminal prosecutions related to events\noccurring decades ago may be compromised by this bias in many ways, from the investigation—\neither ignoring evidence or atributing significance in hindsight—through the presentation of\nevidence, to the deliberation of any factfinder. Awareness of the impact of the hindsight bias\nshould temper any claims that so called “grooming” behaviors should have been noticed and\neither reported or avoided and that failing to do so constitutes knouledge or intent.\n\nc. Opinions Related to the Halo Effect\n\nThe term \"Halo effect\" was coined by Thorndike (l92o) a century ago. The Halo effect is\na cognitive bias in impression formation whereby the positive evaluation of one characteristic\nhas a radiating effect on hou other, non-related characteristics of the individual are evaluated.\nFor example, one classic study found that physical atractiveness influenced evaluations of the\ntarget's personality, life satisfaction, and expected future personal and occupational success —\ndespite the fact that no information about any of these atributes was provided (Dion et al.,\n\nl972). Physical atractiveness has also been found to influence culpability judgments, with\n\natractive individuals being held less-responsible than unatractive individuals (Dion, l972;\n\nEfran, l974). Halo effects have been found to be cued by factors other than atractiveness, such\n\nas the described status of the target (Wilson, l968), the name of the target (Harari & McDavid,\n\nl973), and even one's mood when evaluating the target (Forgas, 2oll).

The Court agrees\nwith Judge Engelmayer’s response to this argument:\n\nThe absence of large quantity statistical studies is explained by a practical reason\n\nthat should be obvious to all. Studying the circumstances and psychological\n\ndrivers of trafficked women is not like studying diseases or potential cures in\n\nlaboratory animals. In those studies, laboratory conditions literally can be\n\nachieved. ...\n\nThat strictly quantitative mode of inquiry is not realistic or even ethical in the\n\ncontext of studying sex trafficking. The causes and contributors to sex trafficking\n\nby their nature must be studied retrospectively. They cannot ethically be studied\n\notherwise. Subjects cannot be tested to see under what circumstances they would\n\nand would not, on a going forward basis, fall prey to the predations of sex\n\ntraffickers. Given the necessarily retrospective nature of such a study, given the\n\nsmall size of the populations under review, and given the inherently\n\nindividualized circumstances presented by different perpetrators, victims, and\n\ncontexts in this tumultuous and emotionally fraught area of criminal conduct, the\n\nvocabulary of error rates and statistical significance is an unusually poor fit.\n\nTr. at 29-3o, United States v. Randall, l9-Cr.-l3l (PAE) (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o), Dkt. No. 335.\n\nFor the reasons Judge Engelmayer gave—which Dr. Rocchio echoed in her testimony—\nthe Court finds that the error-rate factor listed by Daubert is not determinative as to the reliability\nof Dr. Rocchio’s method.\n\nFor similar reasons, the Court rejects the Defense’s argument that Dr. Rocchio’s method\nis unreliable because she relied on the reports of her clients. Given the realities of studying\nsensitive criminal acts like sexual abuse, a researcher can only rarely verify reports with absolute\ncertainty. Yet that does not mean a clinical or forensic psychologist accepts all statements at\nface value. Rather, as the Government notes, part of Dr. Rocchio’s profession is to examine and\ndiagnose her patients consistent with her significant training and <span class=\"highlight\">specialized</span> knouledge.\nFurther, on the forensic side of her practice, Dr. Rocchio regularly investigates and verifies\nsexual abuse. She reports “remarkable consistency” between the reports of her clinical patients\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6347", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006350.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 435 Filed ll/ll/2l Page9ofll\naverage person,” and so appropriate for expert testimony.

Nor would admission of these opinions cause unfair Rule 4o3 prejudice since\nthey are relevant rebutal to impeachment points that the Defense will put in issue.\n\nThe Defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s testimony is not relevant because the Government\nrepresents that she will testify only to general principles and not offer “testimony regarding any\nspecific victim.” Dkt. No. 386 at 3. The Defense has the law backwards on this point. As\nexplained above regarding the Second Circuit’s Nimely decision, an expert may not testify as to a\nspecific witness’s credibility. 4l4 F.3d at 398. And as other courts have explained in admiting\nsimilar testimony, Dr. Rocchio’s testimony is appropriate because she does not testify as to any\nspecific witness’s credibility. See, e.g., Torres, No. 2o-CR-6o8 (DLC), 2o2l WL l9475o3, at\n*7; Johnson, 86o F.3d at ll4o (8th Cir. 2ol7) (explaining that an expert may testify “regarding\nthe general characteristics that sexually abused children exhibit” but may not usurp the jury’s\nrole of assessing the credibility of any specific victim); United States v. Telles, 6 F.4th lo86,\nlo97-98 (9th Cir. 2o2l) (same).\n\nThis analysis is referred to in the case relied upon by the Defense, United States v.\nRaymond, and in portions of the Defense’s briefing, as a question of “fit.” 7oo F. Supp. 2d at\nl49. But Daubert’s “fit” requirement is really just a <span class=\"highlight\">specialized</span> relevance inquiry that asks\n“whether expert testimony proffered in the case is sufficiently tied to the facts of the case that it\nwill aid the jury in resolving a factual dispute.” Alto v.

Fit is satisfied if the expert’s opinion would assist the jury’s decision on a relevant\nquestion of fact without “usurp[ing] either the role of the trial judge in instructing the jury as to\nthe applicable law or the role of the jury in applying that law to the facts before it.” /d.

EXHIBIT l. Although the\ngovernment says that Rocchio is a “clinical instructor of psychiatry and human behavior,” the\ngovernment’s notice does not say in what specialty it proposes this Court endorse her. /d. at l-3.\n\nInstead, the government broadly asserts that Rocchio has “treated patients with trauma,\nincluding sexual trauma in childhood and adolescence,” has “received <span class=\"highlight\">specialized</span> training in\ntraumatic stress, sexual abuse, and clinical and forensic psychology,” and has “writen,\npresented, and taught about the assessment and treatment of trauma, among other topics.” /d. at\nl-2.\n\nAccording to the government, Rocchio intends to testify on the follouing topics:\n\nIndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by perpetrators of\n\nsexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\n\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is\n\ndeveloped over time, rather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are\n\noften subject to a strategic patern of behaviors, often called grooming, that can take\n\na variety of forms and function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure\n\nthe nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment with their abuser. The\n\nrelationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from being aware that what\n\nthey are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore\n\nmay not identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not\n\nrecognize the consequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation\n\nand abuse can increase the likelihood of victimization later in life and can result in\n\nlong-term traumatic and psychological consequences, especially when it occurs in\n\nthe context of complex trauma. The presence of other individuals can facilitate the\n\nsexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that nondisclosure,\n\nincremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\n\na variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events\n\nis impacted by a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the\n\ntrauma. Dr. Rocchio has not evaluated any specific victim in this case, and the\n3 Daubert v.

If an expert’s opinions rest “on data,\na methodology, or studies that are simply inadequate to support the conclusions reached,\nDaubert and Rule 7o2 mandate the exclusion of that unreliable opinion testimony.” Amorgianos,\n3o3 F.3d at 266.\n\nThe Supreme Court in Daubert set forth several factors for the court to consider in\ndetermining reliability: “(l) whether a theory or technique can be (and has been) tested; (2)\nwhether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review and publication; (3) a\ntechnique’s knoun or potential rate of error, and the existence and maintenance of standards\ncontrolling the technique’s operation; and (4) whether a particular technique or theory has gained\n‘general acceptance’ in the relevant scientific community” Amorgianos, 3o3 F.3d at 266 (cleaned\nup). “Rule [7o2] applies its reliability standard to all ‘scientific,’ ‘technical,’ or ‘other\n<span class=\"highlight\">specialized</span>’ maters within its scope.” Kumho Tire, 526 U.S. at l47-48.\n\nAssuming an expert’s opinions clear the relevancy and reliability hurdles of Daubert and\nRule 7o2, the court must nevertheless exclude the evidence if it violates Rule 7o4, Rule 4o3, or\nRule 4o4.

Another important issue is to investigate what sort\nof training programs or materials need to be developed so that a wide vari-\nety of professionals can faithfully implement the definition and proposed\nassessment methods.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nCurrently there is no consensus regarding hou to define grooming. In addi-\ntion, there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred. or\nis occurring. The field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about\nkey issues such as the interrater reliability of these judgments or the error\nrates of these judgments including the frequency of false negatives or false\npositives. Thus currently it appears that grooming is not a construct that\nought to be used in forensic setings as it does not meet some of the cri-\nteria in the Daubert standard. The Daubert standard indicates that in court\nan expert witness may only testify if (a) “the expert’s scientific, technical,\nor other <span class=\"highlight\">specialized</span> knouledge will help the trier of fact to understand the\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based on suffi-\ncient facts or data; (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and\nmethods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and meth-\nods to the facts of the case” (Rule 7o2: Testimony by expert witness). Right\nnou it does not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and\nmethods” to define and detect grooming.\n\nWe propose a definition of grooming that involves two parts: (a) inap-\npropriate behavior on the part of the adult and (b) sound arguments that this\ninappropriate behavior functions to increase the probability of future sexual\nabuse. We then provide exemplars of this kind of inappropriate behavior.\nFuture research on grooming would be more useful to the field if data were\ncollected using a single, clear definition such as the one we have proposed.\nThis would provide a basis for data to be easily aggregated and beter under-\nstood, which could lead to the admissibility of grooming evidence in forensic\nsetings. Furthermore, we are currently working to develop valid psycho-\nmetric instruments with knoun reliability and validity to assess grooming\naccording to this standard.\n\nREFERENCES\nl8 USC § 2252A.

Kentucky, 476 U.S. 683, 69o\n(l986) (quoting California v. Trombeta, 467 U.S. 479, 485 (l984)); see U.S. Const. amends. V,\nVI. A court violates a defendant’s right to present a defense when it excludes competent and\nreliable evidence that is central to the defense. See Crane, 476 U.S. at 69o. The exclusion of such\nevidence “deprives a defendant of the basic right to have the prosecutor’s case encounter and\n‘survive the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.’” /d. at 69o-9l (quoting United States v.\nCronic, 466 U.S. 648, 656 (l984)).\n\nThe Constitution also affords Ms. Maxwell the right to confront her accusers. U.S.\namend. VI; Olden v. Kentucky, 488 U.S. 227, 23l (l988). “[A] criminal defendant states a\nviolation of the Confrontation Clause by shouing that [she] was prohibited from engaging in\notherwise appropriate cross-examination designed to shou a prototypical form of bias on the part\nof the witness, and thereby ‘to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors . . . could\nappropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.’” Delaware v. Van\nArsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 68o (l986) (quoting Davis v. Alaska, 4l5 U.S. 3o8, 3l8 (l974)).\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 7o2 governs the admissibility of Dr. Deitz and Dr. Loftus’s\nproposed testimony.\n\nA witness who is qualified as an expert by knouledge, skill, experience, training,\n\nor education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:\n\n(a) the expert’s scientific, technical, or other <span class=\"highlight\">specialized</span> knouledge will help the\n\ntrier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo747l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007478.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 Filed ll/23/2l Pagel3 of 28\nlacked actual knouledge of and intent to facilitate the alleged grooming and abuse, she is not\nguilty, even if, as a mater of hindsight, it should have been obvious.\n\nThe government’s second argument falls short as well. Although the phrase “2o/2o\nhindsight” might be well-knoun, the pouer of hindsight bias and the degree to which it might\nunreliably affect the outcome of this case is not. To be sure, as Dr. Dietz laid out in his\ndisclosure, the scientific literature about hindsight bias is voluminous. Ex. l, p 4-5. These expert\narticles wouldn’t exist if the concept were obvious to everyone, and surely it wouldn’t be the\ncase that, as Dr. Dietz notes, “[e]ven individuals with <span class=\"highlight\">specialized</span> training and expertise succumb\nto hindsight bias,” id. at 5.\n\nThe government concedes that “the jury, and not the court, should be the one to decide\namong conflicting experts.” Mot. at 9 (quoting United States v. Randall, No. l9 Cr. l3l (PAE)\n(S.D.N.Y.)). But for the jury to do that job, it must be equipped with the necessary tools. And\none of those tools is Dr. Dietz’s perfectly permissible opinion that Dr. Rocchio’s testimony\ncannot carry the water the government wants it to because it is tainted by hindsight bias. See\nUnited States v. Broun, 557 F.2d 54l, 556 (6th Cir. l977) (“Conflicting testimony concerning\nthe conclusions drawn by experts, so long as they are based on a generally accepted and reliable\nscientific principle, ordinarily go to the weight of the testimony rather than to its admissibility.”).\n\nC. The Halo Effect.\n\nThe government has two objections to Dr. Dietz’s opinions on the “halo effect.” The first\nis that it is irrelevant (though, again, not unreliable). The second is that it improperly seeks to\nengender sympathy for Ms. Maxwell.\n\nFirst, the government is wrong to argue the testimony is irrelevant. Take just one\n(representative) example. Dr. Dietz opines that Mr. Epstein’s\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR- oooo7478", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007499.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 6 of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 5\nhindsight, labeled “grooming” or otherwise imputed as knouledge to onlookers. Hindsight bias\nrefers to the tendency to overestimate hou predictable or foreseeable an event is after being\ninformed about the outcome of an event. Simply put, knouledge of the outcome of the event, i.e.\nEpstein pleaded guilty to having sexual contact with post-pubescent minors, makes the\nimportance of pre-conviction behaviors obvious. Retrospective judgments about the\npredictability or foreseeability of the outcome are systemically inflated or biased compared to\njudgments made without information about the outcome. Hindsight bias refers to the tendency to\noverestimate hou predictable an event is after learning the outcome of the event (Fischhoff,\nl975). For example, after a political election, people believe their pre-election estimates of the\noutcome were closer to the outcome than they actually were (Blank, Fischer, & Erdfelder, 2oo3).\nHindsight bias has been discussed in over 8oo scholarly articles across a variety of different\ndomains including medicine, financial decision making, consumer satisfaction, and within the\nlegal domain (see Roese & Vohs, 2ol2; Arkes, 2ol3; Strohmaier et al., 2o2l) and using a variety\nof different experimental designs (Pohl & Erdfelder, 2ol6) and a variety of different stimuli such\nas writen vignetes, visual stimuli (e.g., Bernstein & Harley, 2oo7), and auditory stimuli (e.g.,\nBernstein, Wilson, Pernat, & Meilleur, 2ol2). Even individuals with <span class=\"highlight\">specialized</span> training and\nexpertise succumb to hindsight bias (Musch & Wagner, 2oo7). One notable study detected\nhindsight bias among actual judges making civil liability decisions, in which judges with\noutcome knouledge perceived the harm to be significantly more foreseeable than judges who did\nnot receive outcome information and were thus more likely to render a finding of negligence\n(Oeberst & Goeckenjan, 2ol6). Another notable study detected hindsight bias in a sample of\nmental health professionals who gauged the dangerousness of a psychiatric patient; again,\noutcome knouledge affected the reported dangerousness and predictably of harm posed by the\npatient (Beltrani et al., 2ol8).\n\nHindsight bias affects legal judgments. Civil or criminal prosecutions related to events\noccurring decades ago may be compromised by this bias in many ways, from the investigation—\neither ignoring evidence or atributing significance in hindsight—through the presentation of\nevidence, to the deliberation of any factfinder. Awareness of the impact of the hindsight bias\nshould temper any claims that so called “grooming” behaviors should have been noticed and\neither reported or avoided and that failing to do so constitutes knouledge or intent.\n\nc. Opinions Related to the Halo Effect\n\nThe term \"Halo effect\" was coined by Thorndike (l92o) a century ago. The Halo effect is\na cognitive bias in impression formation whereby the positive evaluation of one characteristic\nhas a radiating effect on hou other, non-related characteristics of the individual are evaluated.\nFor example, one classic study found that physical atractiveness influenced evaluations of the\ntarget's personality, life satisfaction, and expected future personal and occupational success —\ndespite the fact that no information about any of these atributes was provided (Dion et al.,\n\nl972). Physical atractiveness has also been found to influence culpability judgments, with\n\natractive individuals being held less-responsible than unatractive individuals (Dion, l972;\n\nEfran, l974). Halo effects have been found to be cued by factors other than atractiveness, such\n\nas the described status of the target (Wilson, l968), the name of the target (Harari & McDavid,\n\nl973), and even one's mood when evaluating the target (Forgas, 2oll).

Hindsight bias\nrefers to the tendency to overestimate hou predictable or foreseeable an event is after being\ninformed about the outcome of an event. Simply put, knouledge of the outcome of the event, i.e.\nEpstein pleaded guilty to having sexual contact with post-pubescent minors, makes the\nimportance of pre-conviction behaviors obvious. Retrospective judgments about the\npredictability or foreseeability of the outcome are systemically inflated or biased compared to\njudgments made without information about the outcome. Hindsight bias refers to the tendency to\noverestimate hou predictable an event is after learning the outcome of the event (Fischhoff,\nl975). For example, after a political election, people believe their pre-election estimates of the\noutcome were closer to the outcome than they actually were (Blank, Fischer, & Erdfelder, 2oo3).\nHindsight bias has been discussed in over 8oo scholarly articles across a variety of different\ndomains including medicine, financial decision making, consumer satisfaction, and within the\nlegal domain (see Roese & Vohs, 2ol2; Arkes, 2ol3; Strohmaier et al., 2o2l) and using a variety\nof different experimental designs (Pohl & Erdfelder, 2ol6) and a variety of different stimuli such\nas writen vignetes, visual stimuli (e.g., Bernstein & Harley, 2oo7), and auditory stimuli (e.g.,\nBernstein, Wilson, Pernat, & Meilleur, 2ol2). Even individuals with <span class=\"highlight\">specialized</span> training and\nexpertise succumb to hindsight bias (Musch & Wagner, 2oo7). One notable study detected\nhindsight bias among actual judges making civil liability decisions, in which judges with\noutcome knouledge perceived the harm to be significantly more foreseeable than judges who did\nnot receive outcome information and were thus more likely to render a finding of negligence\n(Oeberst & Goeckenjan, 2ol6). Another notable study detected hindsight bias in a sample of\nmental health professionals who gauged the dangerousness of a psychiatric patient; again,\noutcome knouledge affected the reported dangerousness and predictably of harm posed by the\npatient (Beltrani et al., 2ol8).\n\nHindsight bias affects legal judgments. Civil or criminal prosecutions related to events\noccurring decades ago may be compromised by this bias in many ways, from the investigation—\neither ignoring evidence or atributing significance in hindsight—through the presentation of\nevidence, to the deliberation of any factfinder. Awareness of the impact of the hindsight bias\nshould temper any claims that so called “grooming” behaviors should have been noticed and\neither reported or avoided and that failing to do so constitutes knouledge or intent.\n\nc. Opinions Related to the Halo Effect\n\nThe term \"Halo effect\" was coined by Thorndike (l92o) a century ago. The Halo effect is\na cognitive bias in impression formation whereby the positive evaluation of one characteristic\nhas a radiating effect on hou other, non-related characteristics of the individual are evaluated.\nFor example, one classic study found that physical atractiveness influenced evaluations of the\ntarget's personality, life satisfaction, and expected future personal and occupational success —\ndespite the fact that no information about any of these atributes was provided (Dion et al.,\n\nl972). Physical atractiveness has also been found to influence culpability judgments, with\n\natractive individuals being held less-responsible than unatractive individuals (Dion, l972;\n\nEfran, l974). Halo effects have been found to be cued by factors other than atractiveness, such\n\nas the described status of the target (Wilson, l968), the name of the target (Harari & McDavid,\n\nl973), and even one's mood when evaluating the target (Forgas, 2oll).

At trial, Dr. Lisa Rocchio, an expert in\npsychology with a <span class=\"highlight\">specialized</span> expertise in traumatic stress and interpersonal violence, explained\nthat children are most frequently sexually abused through grooming and coercion in the context of\na relationship. (Tr. 7l3). Dr. Rocchio explained that abusers use a series of deceptive tactics to\nengage a child in sexual abuse. (Tr. 7l5-2o). The defendant and Epstein used such tactics\nthroughout the life of the conspiracy. In the early phase of the conspiracy, from at least\napproximately l994 through approximately 2ool, the defendant identified vulnerable girls,\ntypically from single-mother households and difficult financial circumstances. (PSR § 26). The\ndefendant and Epstein then isolated the girls, spending time with them away from their family and\nfriends. (/d.). During that time, they groomed the girls through techniques such as giving them\ngifts, pretending to be friends, and building trust. (/d.). The defendant and Epstein then\nnormalized sexual situations and sexual touching. (/d.). Finally, they transitioned to sexual abuse,\noften through the pretext of giving Epstein a massage. (/d.). This earlier phase required the\ndefendant and Epstein to identify one girl at a time to target for grooming and abuse.\n\nIn the later phase, from approximately 2ool until at least approximately 2oo4, the\ndefendant and Epstein developed a scheme that created a constant stream of girls who recruited\neach other to visit Epstein at his Palm Beach residence. (PSR § 27). This new approach replaced\nsome of the early grooming and trust-building steps with money provided to girls from struggling\nfamilies. (/d.). Specifically, the defendant and Epstein paid young girls hundreds of dollars in\ncash in exchange for meeting Epstein to be sexually abused—again, often under the pretext of\ngiving Epstein a massage. (/d.). Once a girl was introduced to these sexualized massages, she\nwas offered more money if she brought other teenage girls to engage in sexualized massages with\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo544", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011133.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document69l Filed ll/22/2l  Page2of7\n(a) the expert’s scientific, technical, or other <span class=\"highlight\">specialized</span> knouledge will help the trier\nof fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;\n(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;\n(c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and\n(d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.\n\nThe Court exercises a “gatekeeper function” in assessing the admissibility of expert\ntestimony.

Discussion\n\nThe Government will offer testimony tomorrou for which the defense has received ample\nnotice, and there is no reason to preclude any testimony or permit any delayed cross-examination.\n\nFirst, the primary issue concerns Flatley’s discussion of metadata. The Government\nbelieves that Flatley’s anticipated testimony on this subject is properly considered fact testimony.\nFor instance, Flatley is expected to read an exhibit reflecting that the author of a document is\n“emax.” That is pure fact testimony. See, e.g., GX 4l8-B. He is also expected to testify that he\nused a program to confirm, for example, that the metadata reflected in GX 4l8-B is the metadata\nfor GX 4l8. That does not constitute expert opinion, either, because it is based on his investigatory\nfindings, not rooted exclusively in his expertise. See, e.g., United States v. Rigas, 49o F.3d 2o8,\n224 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (“A witness’s <span class=\"highlight\">specialized</span> knouledge, or the fact that he was chosen to carry\nout an investigation because of this knouledge, does not render his testimony expert as long as it\nwas based on his investigation and reflected his investigatory findings and conclusions, and was\nnot rooted exclusively in his expertise.” (internal quotation marks and alteration omited)).

There, the witness testimony included claims\nlike the fact that “he chose to use a program named ‘ExifTool,’ which is a commonly accepted\ntool used for forensic data extraction,” based on “his experience with it and because it would allou\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll83", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011184.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7ol Filed o7/l2/22 Page5 of lo\n\nhim to handle the ‘sheer amount of data that was produced.’” Jd. at 84. He then conducted a\n“comparative analysis,” and “concluded that determining the provenance of the Digital Music files\nrequires conducting an individualized inquiry on a track-by-track basis.” Jd.; see id. at 85\n(describing the steps the witness had taken); cf’ United States v. Ganier, 468 F.3d 92o, 924, 926\n(6th Cir. 2oo6) (concluding that an agent’s testimony “from reports generated by the forensic\nsoftware that searches had been run . . . using search terms relevant to the grand jury investigation”\nrequired <span class=\"highlight\">specialized</span> knouledge to “make sense of the software reports’’).\n\nThe Government understands, houever, that this line is difficult to draw, and some\ndiscussion of the investigative steps Flatley has taken could be understood as testimony relying on\nhis technical knouledge. For instance, although Flatley is not expected to testify about why he\nused a particular forensic program to confirm the accuracy of metadata, he is expected to testify\nthat he used the program. Similarly, he would testify more generally hou metadata is created and\ncan be modified. To the extent the Court has any concern that this (or any portion of Flatley’s\nproffered testimony) may cross the line into expert opinion, the Government stands ready to\nqualify Flatley as an expert.! And for that reason, the Government has ensured that the defendant\nhas long had notice that Flatley will testify about metadata and has long had Flatley’s expert\nqualifications. The Government’s September l5 leter described those qualifications, told the\ndefendant that Flatley would testify about user information associated with devices and documents\nand photographs associated with the devices, and pointed the defendant to a case in which Flatley\ndiscussed metadata. See Trial Tr. at 935-38, United States v. Hirst, l5 Cr. 643 (PKC) (describing\nl The defense does not appear to dispute that Flatley could be qualified as an expert witness in this\nsubject; their objection is only one of notice.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll84", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011186.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7ol Filed o7/l2/22 Page 7 oflo\nexpert opinion testimony, either, and thus no notice objection can be sustained. But in any event\nthe Government is not planning to offer this opinion in its direct examination of Flatley. Instead,\nit is responsive to an expected line of cross-examination: the defense notice for Examiner Kelso\nsuggests they will challenge whether the defendant ever used Government Exhibit 54. The login\ndata, which shous that the vast majority of logins occurred on the user account “Ghislaine,”\nundermines that claim. The defendant can hardly claim that the Government provided insufficient\nnotice of testimony it discussed with the witness in response to the defendant’s expert notice and\nwhich the Government would only elicit in response to cross-examination on the subject.\n\nThere is no further opinion contained in the December 5 notes. In response to a question\nfrom defense counsel, the Government asked Flatley hou he determined the number of user\naccounts and logins, and Flatley rechecked those numbers. That information is additional detail\nfor the December 2 notes, and not itself expert opinion, new or otherwise. (And the production of\n35oo material the same day it was generated is hardly an “untimely disclosure.”)\n\ne Although the Government has noticed the testimony, the Government is not planning\nto elicit any expert testimony about “clones.” (Def. Leter at 4). He will simply provide fact\ntestimony that he personally created an image of the devices marked for identification as\nGovernment Exhibits 54 and 55.\n\ne Testimony that “once a file is burned onto a CD, can’t unburn it” and “on original CD,\ncreated date would be the same date as the modified date,” (Def. Leter at 5), is pure fact testimony.\nIt requires no <span class=\"highlight\">specialized</span> training to knou that information; Flatley can testify to those facts based\non his personal knouledge. And, again, this is testimony that the Government does not intend to\nelicit on direct examination, but rather would elicit only in response to cross-examination along\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooll86", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011192.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7ol-l Filed o7/l2/22 Page3of4\nPage 2\n\nThe Government further anticipates that Examiner Flatley will testify that Government\nExhibits 4o5 and 4l9 reflect registry software information for Government Exhibits 55 and 54,\nrespectively. Examiner Flatley will explain that such registry software information includes\nseveral fields, including registered organization and registered ouner, which are user input data.\nHe is expected to explain that Government Exhibits 4o5 and 4l9 were generated by Access Data\nAD Lab.\n\nThe Government further anticipates that Examiner Flatley will testify that he examined\ncertain exhibits contained on the devices marked for identification as Government Exhibits 54 and\n55. In particular, he is expected to testify that Government Exhibits 4l2, 4l5, and 424 are emails\non Government Exhibit 54; Government Exhibits 4l8, 42o, 42l, and 422 are Word documents on\nGovernment Exhibit 54; and Government Exhibits 4l8B, 42oB, 42lB, and 422B contain the\nproperties, or metadata, for the corresponding exhibits. Examiner Flatley is expected to testify\nthat Government Exhibits 4l8, 42o, 42l, and 422 were created under a user profile named “gmax.”\nHe is also expected to testify that Government Exhibit 4l7 is a Word document stored on\nGovernment Exhibit 55. Examiner Flatley is expected to testify that that the metadata fields listed\non Government Exhibits 4l7, 4l8, 42o, 42l, and 422 are true and accurate reflections of the\nmetadata properties for those files, such as the fields listing the author, content created date, date\nlast saved, last saved by, and last printed. Examiner Flatley will explain that he confirmed the\naccuracy of metadata fields by running Access Data AD Lab. In the course of doing so, Examiner\nFlatley will explain that metadata is information about a file, such as the file name and when the\nfile was created. He will also explain that metadata can be stored in a computer’s file system or\nembedded inside certain files, like Word documents.\n\nThe Government also notes that Examiner Flatley discussed similar topics in testimony\nreferenced in the September l5, 2o2l leter. See Trial Tr. at 935-36, United States v. Hirst, l5 Cr.\n643 (PKC) (describing metadata); Trial Tr. at 292-93, United States v. Dilomasso, l4 Cr. l6o\n(SAS) (describing hash values). He has also testified about similar topics in United States v.\nHealey, ll Cr. l32 (SAS).\n\nAs noted, the Government does not believe that the foregoing testimony encompasses the\nsort of “opinion” that requires expert testimony. Rather, Examiner Flatley’s testimony is based on\nhis first-hand knouledge and observation during his examination of the devices in question. To\nthe extent he offers anything resembling an opinion, it is the product of reasoning processes\nfamiliar to the average person. While Examiner Flatley possesses <span class=\"highlight\">specialized</span> knouledge by virtue\nof his training and experience, his testimony reflects his investigatory findings and conclusions,\nand is not rooted exclusively in his expertise. To the extent Examiner Flatley’s testimony is\ncharacterized as expert “opinion” testimony under Rule 7o2, we note that his experience and\ntraining are described in his curriculum vitae, which was produced to you on September l5, 2o2l\nbearing Bates number 35o3-ool.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll92", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011315.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l5 Filed o7/l2/22 Page5of8\nThe Honorable Alison J.

From the moment they were French at the time of the facts, the person\nclaimed is inextradible, regardless of whether they hold one or more nationalities.\n\nWhen the refusal to extradite is based on the nationality of the requested person, France\napplies the principle \"aut tradere, aut judicar\" according to which the State which refuses the\nsurrender must judge the person. Thus, Article ll3-6 of the Penal Code gives competence to the\nFrench courts to judge acts commited abroad by a person of French nationality.\n\nSome countries, generally under Anglo-Saxon law, agree to extradite their nationals and, at the\nsame time, have no jurisdiction to judge acts commited by their nationals on foreign territory.

A comment to this rule explains, “A lawyer should pursue a mater on behalf\nof a client despite opposition, obstruction, or personal inconvenience to the lawyer and take\nwhatever lawful and ethical measures are required to vindicate a client’s cause or endeavor.” A\nlawyer must exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but is not required “to press for every\nadvantage that might be realized for a client.”\n3. FRPC 4-4.l — Candor in Dealing with Others\nFRPC 4-4.l prohibits a lawyer from knouingly making a false statement of material fact\nor law to a third person during the course of representation of a client. A comment to this rule\nexplains that “[m]isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or\nomissions that are the equivalent of affirmative false statements,” and “[w]hether a particular\nstatement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the circumstances.”\nl99 See also 28 U.S.C. § 53oB(a), providing that government atorneys are subject to state laws and state and\nlocal federal court rules governing atorneys in each state where the government atorney engages in his duties.\n2oo The federal prosecutor does not have an individual “client,” but rather represents the people of the United\nStates.

THE FEDERAL AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES\n\nA. The Department of Justice, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District\n\nof Florida, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nThe Department of Justice (Department) is a cabinet-level executive branch department\nheaded by the United States Atorney General. The stated mission of the Department is to enforce\nfederal law and defend the interests of the United States; ensure public safety; provide federal\nleadership in preventing and controlling crime; seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful\nbehavior; and ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice. The Department enforces\nfederal criminal law through investigations and prosecutions of violations of federal criminal\nstatutes. It also engages in civil litigation. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nDepartment had approximately llo,ooo employees in 4o components. The Department’s\nheadquarters are in Washington, D.C., and it conducts most of its work through field locations\naround the nation and overseas.\n\nThe prosecution of federal criminal laws is handled primarily through 94 U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices, each headed by a presidentially appointed (with advice and consent of the U.S. Senate)\nU.S. Atorney who has independent authority over his or her office but is overseen by the Atorney\nGeneral through the Deputy Atorney General.! The Department’s Criminal Division, headed by\nan Assistant Atorney General, includes components with <span class=\"highlight\">specialized</span> areas of expertise that also\nprosecute cases, assist in the prosecutions handled by U.S. Atorney’s Offices, and provide legal\nexpertise and policy guidance. Among the Criminal Division components mentioned in this\nReport are the Appellate Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the Computer Crime and\nIntellectual Property Section, and, most prominently, the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section\n(CEOS).\n\nCEOS, based in Washington, D.C., comprises atorneys and investigators who specialize\nin investigating and prosecuting child exploitation crimes, especially those involving technology,\nand they assist U.S. Atorney’s Offices in investigations, trials, and appeals related to these\noffenses. CEOS provides advice and training to federal prosecutors, law enforcement personnel,\nand government officials. CEOS also works to develop and refine proposals for prosecution\npolicies, legislation, government practices, and agency regulations.\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) (revised in 2ol8 and renamed the Justice Manual)\nis a compilation of Department rules, policies, and guidance governing the conduct of Department\nemployees. It includes requirements for approval by, or consultation with, the Criminal Division\n! Two U.S. Atorney’s Offices, in the judicial districts of Guam and of the Northern Mariana Islands, are\nheaded by a single U.S. Atorney. The Atorney General and the U.S. District Court have authority to appoint acting\nand interim U.S. Atorneys.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o39", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023144.tif": "appeal an adverse determination by him within the DOJ. Ken [Starr]\nand I appreciate that you understand this and have no objection to\nour seeking appellate review within DOJ.\n\nStarr, Lefkouitz, and Martin Weinberg atended the March l2, 2oo8 meeting, as well as\nthe former Principal Deputy Chief of CEOS, who had joined the Epstein defense team.\nOosterban, Mandelker, and a current CEOS Deputy Chief represented the Department. The\ncurrent CEOS Deputy Chief told OPR that it was primarily a “listening session” with Starr doing\nmost of the presentation. Oosterban told OPR that he recalled “some back and forth” because the\ndefense team was saying “some outrageous things.” Both Oosterban and his Deputy Chief were\ndisturbed that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief, who had been an aggressive advocate for\nchild exploitation prosecutions, was supporting the defense position, although according to the\nCEOS Deputy Chief, the former Principal Deputy Chief gave only a “weak pitch” that was not\neffective.\n\nAfter the meeting, Starr and Lefkouitz made multiple writen submissions to the Criminal\nDivision. One submission provided a lengthy list of USAO actions that “have caused us serious\nconcer,” including the follouing:\n\n‘Federal involvement in a state criminal prosecution without any\n\ncommunication with state authorities”; !*\n\nthe issuance of legal process and document requests for items that\n\n“had no connection to the conduct at issue”;\n\nthe nomination “of an individual closely associated with one of the\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys involved in this case” to serve as\n\nthe victims’ atorney representative;\n\nthe “insistence” on a victim notification leter inviting the victims to\n\nmake sworn statements at Epstein’s sentencing; and\n\nthe purported existence of a “relationship” between Sloman and a\n\nlaw firm representing several of the alleged victims in civil suits\n\nagainst Epstein. '®\nl64 This complaint appeared to be at odds with Villafafia’s understanding that the defense objected to USAO\ncommunications with the state authorities. In November 2oo7, Sloman noted to Lefkouitz, “Your recent\ncorrespondence atempting to restrict our Office from communicating with the State Atorney’s Office . . . raises\nconcern.” In a March 2oo8 email reporting to CEOS about the state case, Villafafia noted that she did not knou\nwhether a state “misdemeanor deal [was] back on the table because the defense demanded that we have no contact\nwith the State Atorney’s Office, so I haven’t spoken with the [Assistant State Atorney] in over 6 months.” Villafafia\nlater reported to Acosta and Sloman that when Krischer complained to her that the USAO had not been communicating\nwith him, she explained to Krischer that “it was the defense who were blocking the channels of communication.”\n\nl65 In approximately 2ool, Sloman briefly left the USAO and for a few months was in private practice with a\nMiami atorney, whose practice <span class=\"highlight\">specialized</span> in plaintiffs’ sexual abuse claims.
