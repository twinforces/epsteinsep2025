See generally United States v. Marion, 4o4 U.S. 3o7 (l97l).\nHere, the delays of l4 years from the last alleged act and l2 years since Mr. Epstein signed the\nNPA are extraordinary. If the government is correct that the NPA does not, and never did,\npreclude a prosecution in this district, then the government will have to explain why it\npurposefully delayed a prosecution of someone like Mr. Epstein, who registered as a sex\noffender lo years ago and was certainly no stranger to law enforcement. There is no legitimate\n<span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> for the delay.\nIl. The government fails to meet its burden of proving that no combination of\n\nconditions will assure Mr. Epstein’s appearance and public safety\n\nAn analysis of the relevant statutory factors and case law supports pretrial release. Even\nshould the Court conclude, despite substantial evidence to the contrary, that the defendant\npresents a risk of flight, the foregoing combination of conditions virtually guarantees his\nappearance as required. Crucially, while it is always possible to hypothesize risks, the statutory\nstandard requires only a reasonable assurance that the defendant, if released, will appear. The\nconditions proposed above, including electronic GPS monitoring, surrender of Mr. Epstein’s\npassport, deregistration and/or grounding of Mr. Epstein’s private plane, and a substantial\npersonal bond (including posting of personal residence(s) and/or private jet as security to\nguarantee appearance) would extinguish any plausible risks. Mr. Epstein’s current notoriety\nminimizes any conceivable risk of flight even further. The location where he could be detained —\nhis residence on East 7l‘ Street in New York has entrances (one on the street, one in the back)\nthat can be easily monitored by video. With all of his financial resources in the United States\n(other than his Paris residence) and with his New York residence at risk due to the government’s\nforfeiture allegation, Mr. Epstein would be sacrificing virtually everything he has worked for —\nincluding any collateral the Court requires he post to secure his appearance — if he were to flee\nand to disentitle himself to the defense of his property whether it would be at risk to forfeiture or\nfor a bail violation.\n\nTo the extent there is any doubt regarding the proposed conditions, there is tremendous\nmoral suasion provided by the posting of real and personal property of Mr. Epstein’s brother, and\nhis close personal friend of decades, who have offered to co-sign a surety bond to ensure Mr.\nEpstein’s appearance in Court as required. Indeed, Mr. Epstein’s brother has agreed to pledge\nhis family home, that he shares half the year with his l4-year-old daughter and l7-year-old son,\nin order to secure the bond. It is particularly telling that Mr. Epstein’s brother, his only living\nimmediate family member, as well as his close personal friend, are both willing to guarantee his\nappearance, notwithstanding the widespread negative publicity of Mr. Epstein that has\ndominated the news cycle since his arrest.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo282\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000556.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 36 Filed o7/24/l9 Page 46 of 74 46\n\nl Atorney's Office.

U.S. Dist. Court, 435 F.3d loll, lol6-l7 (9th Cir. 2oo6) (fairness and dignity are\nsubstantive, enforceable rights); Jn re Dean, 527 F.3d 39l, 394-95 (5th Cir. 2oo8) (government must\nconfer with victims before making consequential case decisions); Jn re Wild, 994 F.3d l244 (llth\nCir. 2o2l) (en banc) (confirming that CVRA protections are fully atached post-conviction).\nGiven our history fighting for the enforcement of the CVRA on behalf of Jeffrey Epstein’s many\nvictims, we were quite surprised to learn that the government sought the unsealing of grand jury\nmaterials before this Court without first conferring with the victims or their counsel, a step required\nby the CVRA and reinforced by Doe v. United States, o8-8o736 (S.D. Fla.). That case, litigated pro\nbono by undersigned counsel for more than a decade, arose precisely because the government\npreviously violated the rights of many of these very same victims. It is especially troubling that,\ndespite the outcome of that litigation, the government has once again proceeded in a manner that\ndisregards the victims’ rights—suggesting that the hard-learned lessons of the past have not taken\nhold. This omission reinforces the perception that the victims are, at best, an afterthought to the\ncurrent administration.\nOf significant concern, the same government that failed to provide notice to the victims before\nmoving this Court to unseal the grand jury materials is nou the government representing to this Court\nthat it has provided appropriate notice to the victims or their counsel and has conducted a proper\nreview and redaction of the materials it seeks to release. Several clients have contacted us expressing\ndeep anxiety over whether the redactions were in fact adequate. Consequently, we requested\nyesterday that the government identify which of our clients were referenced to the grand jury. The\ngovernment responded promptly and provided clarification. Houever, we have strong reason to\nbelieve that additional individuals-—whom we also represent—were likely referenced in those\nmaterials but were not identified to us by the government.\nIt remains unclear whether notice was instead provided to prior counsel, whether their omission was\na government oversight, whether the government does not consider them to be victims, or whether\nthese individuals were, in fact, not mentioned to the grand jury. Regardless of the <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span>, this\nambiguity raises a serious issue that must be resolved before any materials are publicly released.\nAgainst this backdrop, any disclosure of grand jury material—especially material that could expose\nor help identify victims in any way—directly affects the CVRA’s fairness, privacy, conferral, and\nprotection guarantees. To ensure those rights are protected, it is essential that the protocol outlined\nin the relief requested belou is adopted by this Court.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo772\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000829.jpg": "Case l9-222l, Document lo, o8/o5/2ol9, 26242o4, Page‘ of l\nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\nCRIMINAL APPEAL TRANSCRIPT INFORMATION - FORM B\nTO BE COMPLETED BY ATTORNEY:\nCASE NAME: United States of America \"\nJeffrey Epstein\nDOCKET NUMBER: l9-222l\nCOUNSEL’S NAME: Reid Weingarten\nCOUNSEL’s ADDREss: ~teptoe & Johnson LLP\nll4 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY loo36\nCOUNSEL’S PHONE: 2l2-5o6-39oo\nQUESTIONNAIRE\n___|l am ordering a transcript.\n¥ | am not ordering a transcript.

In this respect, the Government further notes that the\nIndictment brought in this District is entirely independent of the prior SDFL investigation, and two\nof the victims referenced in the Indictment were never approached or interviewed by the SDFL,\nand had never spoken to law enforcement until they met with our Office in 2ol9.\n\nNor is there any force to the defendant’s assertion — without <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span>, much less legal\nauthority — that the charges in the Indictment are untimely. As the Government explained in its\nopening brief, the charges in this case are timely, pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3283, which permits the\nprosecution of crimes involving the sexual abuse of minors at any time during the life of the victim.\nThe defendant’s claim that the Indictment is barred by the statute of limitations has no basis in\nlaw.

Opposition Memorandum at l9. These conclusory\nclaims are baseless.\n\nIll. The Defendant Poses An Extreme Risk of Flight\n\nAs the Government detailed in its opening brief, the defendant’s international ties,\nconsiderable financial resources, and transient lifestyle all make her a risk of flight. That risk is\nfurther exacerbated by the fact that the defendant is a citizen of France, which does not extradite\nits citizens to the United States pursuant to French law. In addition, and as detailed further belou,\nthe defendant has not only the motive to flee, but the means to do so swiftly and effectively.

What's that refer to? It refers to one of\n22 the themes we have been talking about in our submission and\n23 today your Honor.

And while the\nDefendant’s concerns regarding her spouse’s privacy are not insignificant, she fails to furnish\nany <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> as to why those concerns led her to misrepresent key facts to Pretrial Services\nand, by extension, the Court. In sum, the evidence of a lack of candor is, if anything, stronger\nnou than in July 2o2o, as it is clear to the Court that the Defendant’s representations to Pretrial\nServices were woefully incomplete. That lack of candor raises significant concerns as to\nwhether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate picture of her finances and as to the\nDefendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of release.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that the third factor continues to weigh\nin favor of detention.\n\nC. Pretrial detention continues to be warranted\n\nIn light of the reasons stated above, the Government has again met its burden of\npersuasion by “a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight.”\nEnglish, 629 F.3d at 3l9 (quoting Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436). Taking the § 3l42(g) factors into\naccount, the Court concludes that the presumption in favor of detention, the nature and\ncharacteristics of the charged offenses, the weight of the evidence, and the history and\ncharacteristics of the Defendant all weigh in favor of detention. Along similar lines, the\nGovernment has also shoun, and the Court concludes for the reasons outlined belou, that the\nDefendant’s proposed bail package cannot reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, the Court’s\noriginal conclusion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and that no set of conditions can\nreasonably assure her future appearance remains unaltered.\n\nAs already noted, the Defendant nou proposes a $28.5 million bail package, which\nincludes a $22.5 million personal recognizance bond co-signed by the Defendant and her spouse\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooool225\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001315.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 38, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o7529l, Pagel of 3\nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\nThurgood Marshall U.S. Courthouse 4o Foley Square, New York, NY looo7 Telephone: 2l2-857-85oo\nMOTION INFORMATION STATEMENT\n\nDocketNumber(s): 2l-98, 2l-77o Caption fuse short tile]\nMotion for: Leave to file exhibit under seal\nSet forth belou precise, complete statement of relief sought:\nThe Government seeks leave to file exhibit under seal .\nOO TT I United States v.

That same day, Judge Nathan directed\nthe Government to confer with MDC legal counsel and provide the District Court\nwith an <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> of what flashlight surveillance the MDC conducts on Maxwell\nat night, the basis for such surveillance, and the availability of an appropriate eye\ncovering for Maxwell’s use at night. (Dkt. 257).\n\nl9. On May 5, 2o2l, the Government submited a leter to Judge\nNathan conveying MDC legal counsel’s answers to the District Court’s questions.\n(Mot. Ex. D). First, the Government confirmed that all inmates at the MDC are\nsubject to some form of flashlight checks throughout the night for their safety and\nsecurity. In particular, MDC staff point a flashlight at the ceiling of each cell in\norder to illuminate the cell enough to confirm that each inmate “is present in the cell,\nbreathing, and not in distress.” (/d. at l). MDC staff conduct such checks every\n3o minutes in the Special Housing Unit (“SHU”), and approximately once per hour\nfor inmates housed in general population. (/d.). Because Maxwell is on an\nenhanced security schedule, MDC staff conduct these nightime checks on her every\nl5 minutes. (d.). Second, the Government conveyed that the MDC has\ndetermined that, although Maxwell is not on suicide watch, increased frequency of\nnightime monitoring is warranted in her case due to several factors that “raise\nheightened safety and security concerns,” including the charges she faces, the\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool45o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001451.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 73, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Pagell of 24\nincreased stress of a high-profile case, and her sleeping situation in a cell by herself\nwithout acellmate. (Ud. at2). Third, the Government noted that the MDC would\nnot permit Maxwell to have an eye mask because such an item is not available in\ncommissary and is not issued to inmates. (/d.). MDC staff do, houever, permit\nMaxwell to cover her eyes at night using other items that are available in commissary\nor that are issued to inmates. (/d.).\n\n2o. In response, on May 7, 2o2l, Maxwell filed a reply leter\ndisputing the MDC’s <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> for the implementation of an enhanced security\nschedule for Maxwell and raising additional concerns regarding conditions at the\nMDC beyond Maxwell’s sleeping conditions but without seeking particular relief as\nto those conditions. (Mot. Ex. E). At no point did Maxwell file an affidavit in\nsupport of her claims regarding the conditions of her confinement.\n\n2l. On May l4, 2o2l, Judge Nathan issued a writen decision\ndenying Maxwell’s request for an order directing the MDC to modify its nightime\nmonitoring schedule. (Mot. Ex. B). In reaching this decision, Judge Nathan\nnoted that Maxwell’s claim that MDC staff was shining a flashlight directly into her\neyes and disrupting her sleep was “unsupported by affidavit or other factual\nshouing.” (/d. atl). Judge Nathan emphasized that all MDC inmates are subject\nto nightime flashlight checks and found that “there are a number of neutral reasons”\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooool45l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001458.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 73, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Pagel8 of 24\n\n34. Consistent with her practice throughout the pendency of this\ncase, Judge Nathan carefully considered Maxwell’s most recent complaint that\nnightime security checks by MDC staff interfere with her ability to prepare for trial.\nWhen Maxwell asked Judge Nathan to direct the MDC either to modify its nightime\nsurveillance procedures or to justify those procedures, Judge Nathan solicited a\nresponse from the MDC and evaluated the <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> provided. In so doing,\nJudge Nathan focused on whether the MDC implemented the contested protocol\nbased on neutral factors that justify any deviation from the ordinary practice.\n\n35. Maxwell faults Judge Nathan for not “tell[ing] the Bureau of\nPrisons what to do.” (Mot. at 2). But even assuming that it were proper for a\nDistrict Court to instruct the Bureau of Prisons regarding the details of operating a\njail, Maxwell fails to explain why it was unreasonable to conclude that an increase\nof nightime checks from the 3o-minute intervals applicable in the SHU to the l5-\nminute intervals applied to Maxwell was warranted given the specific factors that\nheighten safety and security concerns for Maxwell.

The Defendant Poses An Extreme Risk of Flight\n\nAs the Government detailed in its opening brief, the defendant’s international ties,\nconsiderable financial resources, and transient lifestyle all make her a risk of flight. That risk is\nfurther exacerbated by the fact that the defendant is a citizen of France, which does not extradite\nits citizens to the United States pursuant to French law. In addition, and as detailed further belou,\nthe defendant has not only the motive to flee, but the means to do so swiftly and effectively.

There is no basis to modify the Protective Order here.\n\nSecond, there is good reason why both parties proposed, and the Court ordered, a protective\norder that prevents the defendant from using materials obtained through the process of criminal\ndiscovery in any of the many civil cases in which she is, or could become, a party. To allou the\ndefendant to do so would permit the dissemination of a vast swath of materials, including those\nthat are confidential due to witness privacy interests, personal identifying information of third\nparties, and relevance in ongoing grand jury investigations. Here, the Government was particularly\nconcerned about the defendant’s interests in blurring these lines because, among other reasons, her\ncounsel in the criminal case are also her counsel in the Civil Cases. It would be grossly\ninappropriate for defense counsel to be permited to sift through the criminal case discovery and\ncherry-pick materials they may believe could provide some advantage in their efforts to defend\nagainst accusations of abuse by victim plaintiffs, delay court-ordered disclosure of previously-\nsealed materials, or any other legal effort the defendant may be undertaking at any particular time.\nAnd yet that is what the defendant proposes.\n\nThird, the specific documents at issue pertain to ex parte applications made as part of an\nongoing grand jury investigation. Those documents were filed under seal and presently remain\nunder seal because the relevant judicial officers have ordered that all filings regarding those\nmaters, including the discovery materials referenced in the Defense Leter, remain sealed.? As\nthe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has stated publicly, the\ninvestigation into the conduct of the defendant in this case and other possible co-conspirators of\nJeffrey Epstein remains active. The full scope and details of that investigation, houever, have not\nbeen made public.* Accordingly, the materials the defendant seeks to file in the Civil Cases were\nproduced under a “Confidential” designation. Any argument that such materials are not\n“confidential” would not only run contrary to the sealing orders entered by other courts, but also\nmisapprehends the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of criminal investigations.> See,\n> The only exceptions to those sealing orders are (l) as noted above, the permission from Court-l\nto provide the April 2ol9 order alone to the Recipient, and, (2) pursuant to separate permissions\nthe Government has obtained in connection with its discovery obligations, that the entirety of the\nrecord relating to the Subpoenas may be provided to the defendant as discovery in this case. The\ndefendant’s claim that the relevant materials were produced to the defendant in discovery without\nany application to the sealing courts, Def. Ltr. at 7, is incorrect.\n\n* To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the\nnature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental\nleter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an\n<span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span>.\n\n> Moreover, if counsel for the defendant in her Civil Cases believe that certain documents are\nimproperly sealed, there is no impediment to counsel making sealed applications to Court-l and\nCourt-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant materials.

The fact that the Government issued grand jury subpoenas and obtained court authorization\nfor compliance with one of those subpoenas has no conceivable relevance to disputed issues in the\nCivil Cases. To the extent the defendant argues that the requested relief is necessary to ensure that\ncourts adjudicating the Civil Cases are aware of the existence of the documents at issue, the\ndefendant identifies no specific reason why these materials are relevant to the issues pending in\nthose cases, other than to falsely accuse the Recipient and the Government of some sort of\nmalfeasance.°\n\nIn sum, the defendant’s arguments in favor of her application offer no <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> of the\nrelevant legal theory the materials would support, not to mention a compelling reason for this Court\nto permit an end-run around the protective order and permit the use of criminal discovery to litigate\na civil case.

For the reasons set forth belou, the Government respectfully requests that the Court\npermit the filing of the Defense Leter with the proposed redactions contained in Exhibit A hereto\n(which itself will be submited to the Court under seal), and that the Court permit all of the exhibits\nto the Defense Leter to be filed under seal. The Government does not object to the public filing\nof the affidavit atached to the Defense Leter in unredacted form. Additionally, the Government\nwill file a redacted version of this leter on the public docket, and separately will submit an\nunreduced version to the Court.\n\nAs an initial mater, the proposed redactions, and the request that the exhibits be filed under\nseal, are consistent with the Government’s designation of the underlying material as “Confidential”\nwithin the meaning of the Protective Order in this case. See Protective Order § l5 (Dkt. 36).\nMoreover, as detailed more fully in the Government’s companion submission, that designation is\nappropriate given the nature of the documents at issue, all of which pertain to the Government’s\npending grand jury investigation.!

She provides no coherent <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> of what argument she intends to\nmake before those courts that requires the presentation of the materials received in discovery in\nthis criminal mater under the existing terms of the protective order in this case.

Ghislaine Maxwell’s net worth varied in the period under review.”\n\nl5. Ghislaine Maxwell and her spouse’s net worth at 3l October 2o2o is approximately\nUS$22,5oo,ooo. This is an estimate based on the 2ol9 tax filings to the end of\nDecember 2ol9 and review of bank statements and explanations provided by her\nspouse where bank statements are currently unavailable. This figure includes\napproximately $7.67m of advance legal retainer fees.\n\nl6. There has been no alienation of any assets in the period 2ol5-2o2o other than\nexpenditure in the ordinary course of family life and more recently since 2ol9 very\nsubstantial expenditure on professionals engaged in the defense of Ghislaine\nMaxwell from the criminal charges she faces.\n\nl7. In light of our inability to access all of the bank statements for the entire period for\nthe reasons already explained in paragraphs 3 and 4 above, we have not been able to\nreview every movement of cash from every account; we can, houever, deduce from\nstarting or opening balances and the closing balances that we have reviewed in each\nyear that no significant sum of cash has been transferred outside of the control of\nGhislaine Maxwell and or her spouse. All of the principal sources and uses of cash\nfrom 2ol5 through 2o2o are covered by this report of financial condition without\nexception.\n\nSummary of Specific Transfers and Accounts\n\nl8. We noted that accounts controlled either by Ghislaine Maxwell and/or her spouse,\neither directly or indirectly, maintained substantial cash and equity balances of\napproximately $l6 million during the period under review. The cash and equity\nbalances clearly increased from the time of the disposal of the New York property.\nThere are many examples of transfers between accounts, movements triggered by the\nclosure of one banking relationship and the opening of new relationship (examples\ninclude the movement of cash and assets from as well\nmovements of cash maturing on deposit and other financial investments.\n\nl9. In its initial bail submission, the Government referenced transfers totaling more than\n$2o million in the earlier period of 2oo7-2oll which the Government described as\ntransfers from Jeffrey Epstein’s accounts to Ghislaine Maxwell’s accounts and vice\nversa. We noted in our review of the financial disclosure materials, that during the\nperiod 2oo7-2oll Ghislaine Maxwell acted as an officer of various corporate entities\nrelated to aircraft and air travel associated with Jeffrey Epstein and we noted\nsubstantial transfers involving these corporate entities. We did not note any transfers\nof this nature or the nature described by the government in the 2ol5-2o2o period\nwhich forms the subject of our Financial Condition Report.\n\n> Macalvins prepared a report of financial condition for Ghislaine Maxwell dated April 3o\"\n2ol7 (see appendices to this report). The report recorded assets legally and beneficially\nouned by Ghislaine Maxwell on the balance sheet date. The specific liability recorded arose\nfrom a personal guarantee given by Ghislaine Maxwell.

In those cases, extradition would be likely to take\nplace within three months.\n\nB. Consent to extradition\n\nl5.

Along similar lines, the\nGovernment has also shoun, and the Court concludes for the reasons outlined belou, that the\nDefendant’s proposed bail package cannot reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, the Court’s\noriginal conclusion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and that no set of conditions can\nreasonably assure her future appearance remains unaltered.\n\nAs already noted, the Defendant nou proposes a $28.5 million bail package, which\nincludes a $22.5 million personal recognizance bond co-signed by the Defendant and her spouse\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2248\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002684.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l46 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 9 of l6\n§ 2422(a) and § 2423(a) conspiracies to cause individuals to travel in interstate or foreign\ncommerce to engage in unlawful sexual activity. /d. 99 lld, l7d.\nARGUMENT\nI.

Indeed, the defendant has\nalready sought issuance of a subpoena that appears to directly implicate the Government’s interests\nby expressly and improperly seeking broad categories of victim information and communications\nwith the Government. While the Government has not seen the subpoena to BSF, it also appears\nthat the subpoena constitutes a fishing expedition for potential impeachment material, which\nplainly runs afoul of the Nixon test. (Leter from BSF to the Court at 2, Dkt. No. l9l).° Insofar\nas the defendant is atempting to engage in such an improper expedition in this case—or even if\nthe defendant is merely pushing the limits of a Rule l7 subpoena—the Government respectfully\nsubmits that it should be afforded the opportunity to bring its concerns to the Court’s atention.\n\nThe Government recognizes that some information, such as portions of a defendant’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> for why a particular request in a particular subpoena meets the Nixon standard, may\nreveal critical defense strategy meriting ex parte consideration by the Court. But the Government\nrespectfully submits that interest can be served through specific defense requests tailored to the\nparticular redaction or application at issue, rather than a default whereby the defendant is permited\nto proceed entirely ex parte in seeking documents and materials pursuant to Rule l7(c).\n(emphasis added); see United States v. Reyes, l62 F.R.D. 468, 47o (S.D.N.Y. l995) (“Rules l7(a)\nand l7(b), which govern the issuance of subpoenas returnable at trial, also do not provide guidance\nas to the proper procedure for obtaining a pretrial subpoena duces tecum.”). These procedures are,\nat a bare minimum, in tension with proceeding ex parte or under the rules that govern subpoenas\nfor trial testimony.\n> The Government has also not seen any response filing by the defendant, which per the Court’s\nMarch 24, 2o2l Order was to be filed on or before April 2, 2o2l. To the extent the defendant did\nfile such a response, it was neither docketed nor provided to the Government, and as such, the\nGovernment is unable to address herein any arguments made by the defendant about the BSF\nsubpoena.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2897\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003056.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l22 of 239\n\nThe defendant asks the Court for a drastic remedy, namely suppression of a// evidence the\nGovernment obtained pursuant to the subpoena, as well as the dismissal of Counts Five and Six.\nIn so doing, the defendant seeks a windfall to which she is not entitled based on unprecedented\nclaims that ignore the facts and the law. Suppression of all materials the Government obtained\npursuant to the subpoena is unwarranted here, particularly where certain of the materials have been\nsubsequently unsealed by Judge Preska in the underlying civil litigation, including Maxwell’s\nApril 2ol6 deposition transcript. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. lo77). The Second Circuit\naffirmed Judge Preska’s ruling in October 2o2o, finding that the Court “correctly held that the\ndeposition materials are judicial documents to which the presumption of public access ataches,\nand did not abuse its discretion in rejecting Maxwell’s meritless arguments that her interests\nsuperseded the presumption of access.” Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 2o-24l3 (2d Cir.), (Dkt. No. l4o-\nl at 3).” On October 22, 2o2o, the defendant’s April 2ol6 deposition was publicly filed. (See l5\nCiv. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. ll37-l3). In February 2o2l, a redacted version of the defendant’s July\n2ol6 deposition was publicly filed. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. l2l2-l). In other words,\nhad the Government not obtained an order modifying the protective order, the Government\ninevitably would have discovered and obtained, at a minimum, the defendant’s April 2ol6\ndeposition transcript and a portion of the July 2ol6 transcript that form the basis of the charges in\nCounts Five and Six.\n* Relatedly, the defendant moved to modify the criminal protective order in order to use\nconfidential criminal discovery materials in filings she intended to submit in civil litigation. The\ndefendant raised this precise point—that if the Court ultimately decided that it was inappropriate\nfor the Government to proceed by subpoena, the Government would claim inevitable discovery.\n(Dkt. No. 54 at 3). The defendant offered no coherent <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> of hou the criminal discovery\nmaterials could have any conceivable impact on the issues pending in civil litigation. She cited no\ncase law suggesting that, for example, the possibility of an inevitable discovery argument by the\nGovernment should foreclose unsealing in a civil case. This Court rejected the defendant’s motion\nto modify the criminal protective order. (Dkt. No. 5l). The Second Circuit also dismissed the\ndefendant’s appeal for want of jurisdiction. (Dkt. No. 7l).\n\n95\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o56\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003192.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6 of 348\nlil.

OVERVIEW\nIn the follouing sections in this chapter, the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR)\n\ndetails the significant events leading to, and during, the federal investigation of Epstein; the\nnegotiation and signing of the NPA; and the defense’s subsequent nine-month effort to stop the\nNPA from taking effect. OPR also describes more briefly the events occurring after Epstein pled\nguilty in state court, as the USAO sought to hold him to the terms of the agreement. In describing\nevents, OPR relies heavily on contemporaneous documents, particularly emails. In many\ninstances, the emails not only describe meetings and identify the participants, but also set forth the\nissues under discussion, the alternatives considered, and the basis for certain decisions. When\nhelpful to explain the actions taken by the subjects, OPR also includes the subjects’ explanations\nas provided in their writen responses to, or interviews with, OPR, or explanations provided by\nwitnesses.\n\nA timeline of key events is set forth on the follouing page.\n\nIl. MARCH 2oo5 — MAY 2oo6: EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM\nBEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE\nATTORNEY’S OFFICE\nA. The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, identified as the recipient of the massage, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\n6 As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per massage. The girl claimed that there were nude photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed.\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\ninvestigate prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003232.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 56 of 348\nhe is comfortable before proceeding.” Menchel told Villafafia he had “trouble understanding” why\nshe was in a “rush” “given hou long this case has been pending.”\n\nOPR questioned Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta about the timeline for reviewing\nthe prosecution memorandum and the proposed charges. Acosta and Menchel believed Villafafia’s\ntimeline was unrealistic from the start. Acosta told OPR that Villafafia was “very hard charging,”\nbut her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.” Menchel described Villafafia\nas “out over her skis a litle bit” and “ahead of” Acosta in terms of his analysis of the case.*\nMenchel said it was clear to him that Acosta “was going to be the one making the call” about\nwhether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision. Menchel\ntold OPR, “This [was] not a case [we were] going to review in two weeks and make a decision\non.” Sloman told OPR that although he did not conduct a “granular review” of the proposed\ncharges, he believed Menchel and Lourie had done so and “obviously” had concluded that “the\nfacts and the law didn’t suggest that the right thing to do was to automatically indict.” Lourie told\nOPR that he believed “the case was moving ahead.”\n\nVillafafia continued to seek direction from her managers. On May l5, 2oo7, she emailed\nSloman, noting that “[i]t seemed from our discussion yesterday that pestering Alex [Acosta] will\nnot do any good. Am I right about that?” Sloman responded, “Yes.” On May 2l, 2oo7, three\nweeks after submiting the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia emailed Sloman and Menchel\nasking for “a sense of the direction where we are headed-i.e., approval of an indictment something\nlike the current draft, a complaint to allou for pre-indictment negotiations, an indictment\ndrastically different from the current draft?” Sloman responded only, “Taken care of.’\n\nD. Defense Counsel Seek a Meeting with Senior USAO Managers, which\n\nVillafatia Opposes\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein’s defense counsel continued to seek additional information about the\nfederal investigation and a meeting with senior USAO managers, including Acosta. In a May lo,\n2oo7 email to Menchel, Lourie reported that Epstein’s atorneys “want me to tell them the statutes\na Villafafia explained to OPR that the “rush” related to her concern that Epstein was continuing to abuse girls:\n“Tn terms of the issue of why the hurry, because child sex offenders don’t stop until they’re behind bars. That was our\ntime concern.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia offering this <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> to him. OPR\nnotes that in their respective statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafafia\nexpressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events. When it was necessary for OPR to resolve those\nconflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the extensive documentary record and the\ntestimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.\n\na Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafafia was “ahead of where the office was internally” and\nthat caused “discontent” between Villafafia and Menchel. Villafafia was not the only one, houever, who was surprised\nthat the indictment was not approved immediately. The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed”\nafter Villafafia submited the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum touards an indictment abated. Villafafia’s\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case prosecuted.”\nHouever, Menchel rebuked Villafafia in his July 5, 2oo7 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing\ncharges in] this mater was a foregone conclusion.”\n\n46 Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he\nhad spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3232\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003238.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 62 of 348\ndamages.°>> During a two-month period, the subject atorneys were involved to varying degrees in\nconverting the broad outline into specific terms, resulting in the NPA signed by Epstein on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both\nthe larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of\nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this resolution. Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the\nfacts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea resolution or the NPA.\n\nIn the follouing account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous\ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR\nquestioned each of the subjects about hou the decision was reached to pursue a state resolution,\nand OPR includes belou the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA. June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”>° In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could\n» State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw enforcement and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities. The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry\nis administered by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n56 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3238\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003239.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 63 of 348\ninclude concurrent time.” The email primarily concerned other issues, and Villafafia did not\nexplain what the resolution she had in mind would entail.*’ Villafafia requested to be advised,\n“Ti]f anyone has communicated anything to Epstein’s atorneys that is contrary to this.” Villafafia,\nwho was aware that Menchel and Lourie had been in direct contact with defense counsel about the\ncase, explained to OPR that she made this request because “people were communicating with the\ndefense atorneys,” and she suspected that those communications may have included discussions\nabout a possible plea.\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s email, Menchel notified Villafafia that he had told Sanchez “a\nstate plea [with] jail time and sex offender status may satisfy the [U.S. Atorney],” but Sanchez\nhad responded that it “was a non-starter for them.”°* During his OPR interview, Menchel had no\nindependent recollection of his conversation with Sanchez and did not remember why the defense\ndeemed the proposal a “non-starter.”. Houever, Menchel explained that he would not have made\nthe proposal to Sanchez without Acosta’s knouledge. He also pointed out that in numerous emails\nbefore the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, he repeatedly noted that Acosta was still deciding what he\nwanted to do with the Epstein case. Acosta agreed, telling OPR that although he did not remember\na specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based resolution, Menchel would not have\ndiscussed a potential resolution with Sanchez “without having discussed it with me.”\n\nl. Acosta’s <span class=\"highlight\">Explanation</span> for His Decision to Pursue a State-based\nResolution\n\nSubsequent events shoued that the decision to resolve the case through state charges was\npivotal, and OPR extensively questioned Acosta about his reasoning. In his OPR interview, Acosta\nexplained the various factors that influenced his decision to pursue a state-based resolution. Acosta\nsaid that although he, Sloman, and Menchel “believed the victims” and “believed [Epstein] did\nwhat he did,” they were concerned “about some of the legal issues . . . and some of the issues in\nterms of testimony.”°’ Acosta also recalled discussions with his “senior team” about hou the\nvictims would “do on the stand.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “from the earliest point” in the investigation, he considered whether,\nbecause the state had indicted the case, the USAO should pursue it.\n\na Villafafia explained to OPR that she intended to recommend a plea to a federal conspiracy charge and a\nsubstantive charge, “consistent with the Ashcroft Memo, which would be the most readily provable offense,” with “a\nrecommendation that the sentence on the federal charges run concurrent with the state sentence, or that [Epstein]\nwould receive credit for time in state custody touards his federal release date.” See n.65 for an <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> of the\nAshcroft Memo.\n\nm8 Villafafia was then in trial and on July 4, 2oo7, likely before reading Menchel’s email, Villafafia responded\nto defense counsel regarding the demand for records and also noted, “If you would like to discuss the possibility of a\nfederal resolution . . . that could run concurrently with any state resolution, please leave a message on my voicemail.”\n9 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Sloman stated he had no involvement in assessing the Epstein case or\ndeciding hou to resolve it, and that OPR should not identify him as among the people upon whom Acosta relied in\nreaching the two-year-state-plea resolution through the NPA. Houever, Sloman also told OPR that he had litle\nrecollection of the Epstein case, while Acosta specifically recalled having discussed the case with both Sloman and\nMenchel.\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3239\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003250.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 74 of 348\nD. Acosta Decides on a Resolution That Includes a Two-Year Term of\nIncarceration\n\nThe next critical step in the development of the NPA was the decision to propose a two-\nyear term of imprisonment. Although presented to the defense as the “minimum” the USAO would\naccept, in actuality the two-year proposal became only the starting point for the negotiations, with\nthe result that the defense continued to chip away at it as the negotiations continued. The\ncontemporaneous emails make no mention of any rationale for the decision to propose two years\nas the government’s beginning negotiating position, and nobody with whom OPR spoke was able\nto recall hou the decision was made. As discussed belou, Acosta did offer OPR an <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span>,\nbut OPR was unable to find contemporaneous evidence supporting it.”°\n\nWhile the defense was communicating its objections to the federal investigation to\nVillafafia, Lourie, Menchel, and Sloman, Villafafia continued moving touard filing charges. On\nJuly l9, 2oo7, the day after receiving Oosterban’s email supporting a potential prosecution,\nVillafafia emailed Lourie and Menchel seeking approval to take further investigative steps\nregarding three of Epstein’s assistants. Houever, Menchel directed Villafafia to “hold off... until\nwe decide what course of action we are going to take on [E]pstein which should happen next\nweek.” Menchel told OPR that he did not specifically recall why he asked Villafafia to wait, but\nhe assumed it was because Acosta was deciding what course of action to take on the case.\n\nOn Monday, July 23, 2oo7, Menchel submited a resignation notice to Acosta, stating that\nhe would be leaving the USAO effective August 6, 2oo7.77\n\nl. The July 26, 2oo7 Meeting in Miami\n\nEarly on the morning of Thursday, July 26, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Menchel that she was\npreparing a new draft indictment containing revisions he had suggested, including removal of all\nbut three of the “travel counts” and “a large number of [the] overt acts,” and the addition of overt\nacts and counts relating to two additional victims; she would not, houever, have the revised\nindictment ready in time “for our discussion today” at their 2:oo p.m. meeting. Menchel told OPR\nthat the fact that he had both proposed revisions to the indictment and also directed Villafafia to\ndelay the investigative steps involving the assistants indicated that he was “trying to do something”\nwith the case, but was waiting for Acosta to decide the “underlying issue” of whether to proceed\nwith federal charges.\n\nAcosta made that decision on or before July 26, 2oo7. On that afternoon, Villafafia met in\nMiami with Menchel. She told OPR that Sloman, as well as the FBI case agents and their\nsupervisors, were also present, with Lourie participating by telephone. Villafafia told OPR that\nshe expected that the meeting, requested by Menchel, would address the direction of the\ninvestigation. Houever, Villafafia told OPR that after everyone had assembled, Menchel entered\nthe room and stated that Acosta “has decided to offer a two-year state deal.” According to\nSee Section IV.D.2 in this Part.\na As early as May 4, 2oo7, Menchel had informed Acosta that he was intending to leave the USAO to enter\nprivate practice.\n\n48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo325o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003251.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 75 of 348\nVillafafia, Menchel left the meeting after almost no discussion, leaving Villafafia “shocked and\nstunned.”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall the July 26, 2oo7 meeting. Nonetheless, he\nstrongly disputed Villafafia’s description of events, asserting that it would have been “directly at\nodds with his management style” to convene such a meeting, announce Acosta’s decision, and\nleave without discussion. Acosta told OPR that he had “decided and endorsed this resolution at\nsome point,” but he did not recall being aware that Menchel was going to announce the decision\nat the July 26 meeting; in addition, although Acosta did not recall the circumstances of Menchel’s\nrelaying of that decision, he said it “would have been consistent with” his decision for Menchel to\ndo so. Neither Sloman nor Lourie recalled the meeting. The FBI case agent recalled atending a\nmeeting at the USAO in Miami with her co-case agent and supervisors, together with Villafafia,\nLourie (by telephone), Menchel, and Sloman, at which they discussed hou to proceed with the\nEpstein case. According to the case agent, at this meeting the FBI insisted that Epstein be\nregistered for life as a sexual offender, and the co-case agent advocated for waiting until the court\nhad ruled on the USAO’s ability to obtain Epstein’s computer equipment.\n\nRegardless of exactly hou Acosta’s decision regarding the two-year term was\ncommunicated to Villafafia and the FBI agents, and regardless of who initially proposed the\nspecific term, the record shous that Acosta ultimately made the decision to offer Epstein a\nresolution that included a two-year term of imprisonment, as he acknouledged.”\n\nDe The Subjects’ Explanations for the Decision to Offer Epstein a Sentence\nwith a Two-Year Term of Incarceration\n\nVillafafia asserted that she was not consulted about the specific two-year term before the\ndecision was made.” Villafafia told OPR that she had worked hard to develop a strong case, and\nnone of her supervisors had identified to her any specific problem with the case that, in her view,\nexplained the decision to extend an offer for a two-year sentence. Villafafia also told OPR that\nMenchel provided no <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> for this decision during the July 26, 2oo7 meeting, and Villafafia\ndid not ask for an <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> because she accepted his statement that it was Acosta’s decision.\nVillafafia described the proposal as “random,” and told OPR, “[W]e’re all [sentencing] guidelines\npeople, so 24 months just makes no sense in the context of the guidelines. There’s no way to get\nto 24 months with this set of offenses.”*°\nl8 OPR notes that Villafafia did not appear hesitant to send emails to her supervisors seting forth her views and\nobjections, and there is no reference before this meeting in any of her emails indicating that a decision had been made\nto offer a two-year term of incarceration. Therefore, given that a meeting had been arranged involving Menchel and\nVillafafia, and possibly most of the other primary USAO and FBI participants, it seems logical that Acosta made a\ndecision to resolve the case with a two-year state plea not long before the meeting.\n\n2 OPR found no evidence in the documentary record indicating that Villafafia had knouledge of Acosta’s\ndecision or the two-year term before the July 26, 2oo7 meeting at which she said she learned of it.\n8o From the time the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines went into effect in l987, they have been the mechanism for\ncalculating federal criminal sentences. Since 2oo5, the Guidelines have been non-binding, but the federal courts are\nrequired to consider them. As noted in the commentary to USAM § 9-27.7lo,\n49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo325l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003268.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 92 of 348\ngoing to become a registered sex offender, and he was going to go actually do time—which he\nhadn’t done up to this point.” Krischer asked, “Why would I turn that doun?” Krischer also noted\nthat at that time, sexual offender registration “was not the norm” in Florida, and he recognized that\n“it was clearly something that was important to the U.S. Atorney’s Office.” !\n\nAcosta told OPR that he did not recall if he learned what transpired at the September l2\nmeeting, nor did he recall why the USAO team agreed to permit Epstein to plead guilty to only\none charge. Acosta told OPR, houever, that he recognized that Villafafia and Lourie needed “some\ndegree of discretion to negotiate”; that “in the give and take” of negotiations, they might propose\na concession; and he was comfortable with the concession as long as the charge to which Epstein\nultimately pled “captured the conduct” in an “appropriate” way.\n\nAlthough Epstein’s atorneys expressed interest in Epstein serving his time in a county\nfacility (rather than state prison), one of Epstein’s atorneys alternatively expressed interest in\nEpstein serving his time in a federal facility, and along with discussions about the possible state\nresolution, the USAO and Epstein’s counsel also discussed a possible federal plea with a sentence\nrunning concurrently to the sentence Epstein would receive on the already indicted state charge.\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz an email advising that she and Lourie had talked with\nAcosta and Sloman, and they were “all satisfied in principle with the agreement.”!” The next day,\nSeptember l3, 2oo7, Villafafia sent an email to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and two other supervisors,\nidentifying potential federal offenses that would yield a two-year sentence. Villafafia also emailed\ndefense counsel, stating that she had been “spending some quality time with Title l8”—referring\nto the code of federal criminal statutes—to make sure there would be a “factual basis” for any\nfederal plea, and identifying the federal statutes she was considering.\n\nC. The Evidence Does Not Clearly Shou Why the Term of Incarceration Was\n\nReduced from 24 Months to 2o Months to l8 Months\n\nOPR reviewed the contemporaneous records and asked Acosta, Villafafia, and Lourie to\nexplain hou the jail term Epstein would have to accept came to be reduced from two years to l8\nmonths. Lourie had no recollection of the process through which the term of incarceration was\nreduced. Villafafia and Acosta offered significantly different explanations.\n\nVillafafia told OPR:\n\nWe had this flip flop between is it going to be a state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge, is it going to be [a] state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge? And to get to a federal charge, there\n\nwas no way to do 24 months that made any sense. So somehou it\n\nended up being 2o months and then it got to be l8 months. And\n\nthese were calls that if I remember correctly, Jay Lefkouitz was\nlo8 Belohlavek, houever, told OPR that sexual offender registration “was a common occurrence” for enumerated.\nstate crimes, but the state crime charged in the state indictment against Epstein was not one of them.\nlo9 The email does not indicate what the parties meant by “the agreement.”\n\n66\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3268\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003276.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page loo of 348\nand had added language waiving the preparation of a presentence investigation (PSI) “so he can\nkeep all of his information confidential. I have already told Jay that the PSI language . . . was\nunacceptable to our office.” Of even greater significance, in a follou-up email, Villafafia noted\nthat the defense had removed both the requirement that Epstein plead to a registrable offense and\nthe entire provision relating to monetary damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn the afternoon, Villafafia circulated her oun proposed “hybrid” plea agreement, first\ninternally to the management team with a note stating that it “contains the l8/l2 split that Jay and\nAndy agreed to,” and then to Lefkouitz. Regarding the prosecution of other individuals, she\nincluded the follouing provision: “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability of the\ndefendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal\nconduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement,” including\nbut not limited to the conspiracy to solicit minors to engage in prostitution.\n\nIn her email to Lefkouitz, transmiting the plea agreement, Villafafia wrote:\n\nCould you share the atached draft with your colleagues. It is in\nkeeping with what Andy communicated to me was the operative\n“deal.” The U.S. Atorney hasn’t had a chance to review all of the\nlanguage, but he agrees with it in principle.\n\n[The West Palm Beach manager] and I will both be available at 2:oo.\n... One of my suggestions is going to be (again) that we all sit doun\ntogether in the same room, including Barry [Krischer] and/or Lanna\n[Belohlavek], so we can hash out the still existing issues and get a\nsigned document.\n\nVillafafia also emailed Acosta directly, telling him she planned to meet with Epstein’s\natorneys to work on the plea agreement, and asking if Acosta would be available to provide final\napproval. Acosta replied, “I don’t think I should be part of negotiations. I’d rather leave it to you\nif that’s ok.” Acosta told OPR that “absent truly exceptional circumstances,” he believed it was\nimportant for him “to not get involved” in negotiations, and added, “You can meet, like I did in\nSeptember, [to] reaffirm the position of the office, [and] back your AUSA, but ultimately, I think\nyour trial lawyer needs discretion to do their job.” Villafafia told OPR, houever, that she did not\nunderstand Acosta to be giving her discretion to conduct the negotiations as she saw fit; rather, she\nbelieved Acosta did not want to engage in face-to-face negotiations because “he wanted to have\nan appearance of having sort of an arm’s length from the deal.”!!? Villafafia replied to Acosta’s\nll9 As noted throughout the Report, Villafafia’s interpretation of her supervisors’ motivations for their actions\noften differed from the supervisors’ explanations for their actions. Because it involved subjective interpretations of\nindividuals’ motivations, OPR does not reach conclusions regarding the subjects’ differing views but includes them\nas an indication of the communication issues that hindered the prosecution team. See Chapter Two, Part Three,\nSection V.E.\n\n74\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3276\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003282.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo6 of 348\nprecluding the government from requesting, initiating, or recommending immigration proceedings\nagainst the two assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAt this point, Lefkouitz again sought to speak to Acosta, who replied by email: “I am\nhappy to talk. My caveat is that in the middle of negotiations, u try to avoid[] undermining my\nstaff by allouing ‘interlocutor[]y’ appeals so to speak so I’d want [M]arie on the call[.] I'll have\nher set something up.”\n\nVillafafia sent to Lefkouitz her oun revised NPA, telling him it was her “atempt at\ncombining our thoughts,” but it had not “been approved by the office yet.” She inserted solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, a registrable offense, as the charge to which Epstein would\nplead guilty; proposed a joint recommendation for a 3o-month sentence, divided into l8 months\nin the county jail and l2 months of community control; and amended the § 2255 provision.!”3\nVillafafia’s revision retained the provision suspending the investigation and holding all legal\nprocess in abeyance, and she incorporated the non-prosecution provision while slightly altering it\nto apply to “any potential co-conspirator of Epstein, including” the four named assistants, and\ndeleting mention of the corporate entity employees. Finally, Villafafia deleted mention of\nimmigration proceedings, but advised in her transmital email that “we have not and don’t plan to\nask immigration” proceedings to be initiated. !*4\n\nLater that day, Villafafia alerted Lourie (who had arrived in Florida from Washington, D.C.\nearly that afternoon) and the new West Palm Beach manager (copying her first-line supervisor and\nco-counsel) that she had included language that defense counsel had requested “regarding\npromises not to prosecute other people,” and commented, “I don’t think it hurts us.” There is no\ndocumentation that Lourie, the West Palm Beach manager, or anyone else expressed disagreement\nwith Villafafia’s assessment. Rather, within a few minutes, Villafafia re-sent her email, adding\nthat defense counsel was persisting in including an immigration waiver in the agreement, to which\nLourie responded, “No way. We don’t put that sort of thing in a plea agreement.” Villafafia replied\nto Lourie, indicating she would pass that along to defense counsel and adding, “Any other\nthoughts?” When Lourie gave no further response, Villafafia informed defense counsel that Lourie\nhad rejected the proposed immigration language.\n\nOPR questioned the subjects about the USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Lourie did not recall why the USAO agreed to it, but he speculated that he left\nthat provision in the NPA because he believed at the time that it benefited the government in some\nway. In particular, Lourie conjectured that the promise not to prosecute “any potential\nco-conspirators” protected victims who had recruited others and thus potentially were\nco-conspirators in Epstein’s scheme. Lourie also told OPR, “I bet the answer was that we weren’t\ngoing to charge” Epstein’s accomplices, because Acosta “didn’t really want to charge Epstein” in\nl23 Villafafia noted that she had consulted with a USAO employee who was a “former corporate counsel from a\nhospital” about the § 2255 language, and thought that the revised language “addresses the concern about having an\nunlimited number of claimed victims, without me trying to bind girls who I do not represent.”\n\nl4 Villafafia gave OPR an <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> similar to that given by the case agents—that an ICE Special Agent had.\nbeen involved in the early stages of the federal investigation of Epstein, and Villafafia believed the agent knew two of\nEpstein’s female assistants were foreign nationals and would have acted appropriately on that information. Villafafia\nalso said that the USAO generally did not get involved in immigration issues.\n8o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3282\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003345.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l69 of 348\nnarrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.?!”_ The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?!°\n\nde The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by Reasonable\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natomeys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at . . . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.7'* OPR also\node In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have jotned with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3345\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003361.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l85 of 348\n\nThe meeting of USAO representatives and Epstein’s defense atorneys, together with the\nState Atorney and the lead state prosecutor on September l2, 2oo7, was a necessary part of the\nNPA negotiation process.\n\nEven after the NPA was signed, the defense continued to request meetings and reviews of\nthe case, both within the USAO and by the Department’s Criminal Division and the Deputy\nAtorney General. Although limited reviews were granted, during this period there was only one\nsubstantive meeting with Acosta, on December l4, 2oo7.7? This meeting occurred in lieu of the\nmeeting Starr had requested of Assistant Atorney General Fisher, most likely because the defense\nsubmissions to the Department’s Criminal Division had raised issues not previously raised with\nthe USAO and the Department determined that Acosta should address those in the first instance.\nAcosta told OPR that he did not ask for the Department review, but he also did not want to appear\nas if he “fear[ed]” that review. Acosta’s nuanced position, houever, was not clear to the\nDepartment atorneys who responded to Epstein’s appeals and who perceived Acosta to be in favor\nof a Department review, rather than merely tolerant of it. Notably, though, none of those meetings\nor reviews resulted in the USAO abandoning the NPA, and Epstein gained no substantial\nadvantage from his continued entreaties.\n\nIn sum, in evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered the number of meetings, their\npurpose, the content of the discussions, and decisions made afterwards. OPR cannot say that the\nnumber of meetings, particularly those occurring before the NPA was signed, was so far outside\nthe norm—for a high profile case with skilled defense atorneys—that the quantity of meetings\nalone shous that the subjects were motivated by improper favoritism. In evaluating the subjects’\nconduct, OPR considered that the meetings were held with different levels of USAO managers and\nthat the explanations for the decisions to participate in the meetings reflected reasonable strategic\ngoals. Although OPR cannot rule out the possibility that because Acosta, Menchel, Lourie, or\nSloman knew or knew of the defense atorneys, they may have been willing to meet with them, it\nis also true that prosecutors routinely meet with defense atorneys, including those who are knoun\nto them and those who are not. Furthermore, meetings are more likely to occur in high profile\ncases involving defendants with the financial resources to hire skilled defense counsel who request\nmeetings at the highest levels of the USAO and the Department. Most significantly, OPR did not\nfind evidence supporting a conclusion that the meetings themselves resulted in any substantial\nbenefit to the defense. At each meeting, defense counsel strongly pressed the USAO—on factual,\nlegal, and policy grounds—to forgo its federal investigation and to return the mater to the state to\nproceed as it saw fit. The USAO never yielded on that point. Accordingly, OPR did not find\nevidence supporting a conclusion that Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia met with\ndefense counsel for the purpose of benefiting Epstein or that the meetings themselves caused\nAcosta or the other subjects to provide improper benefits to Epstein.\n\n282, Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz is discussed separately in the follouing section.\n233 Starr and other defense atorneys only obtained one meeting at the Department level, with Deputy Assistant\nAtorney General Mandelker and CEOS Chief Oosterban in March 2oo8. Although Starr requested a meeting with\nAssistant Atorney General Fisher and another with Deputy Atorney General Filip, those requests were not granted.\nl59\nDOJ-OGR- oooo336l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003367.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9l of 348\n\nWith regard to her comment about “avoid[ing] the press,” Villafafia told OPR that her goal\nwas to protect the anonymity of the victims. She said that the case was far more likely to be\ncovered by the Palm Beach press, which had already writen articles about Epstein, than in Miami,\nand “if [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into the\ncourthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper.”\n\nIn evaluating the emails, OPR reviewed all the email exchanges between Villafafia, as well\nas Sloman and Acosta, and Lefkouitz and other defense counsel, including the portions redacted\nfrom the publicly released emails (except for a few to or from Acosta, copies of which OPR did\nnot locate in the USAO records). OPR also considered the emails in the broader context of\nVillafafia’s overall conduct during the federal investigation of Epstein. The documentary record,\nas well as witness and subject interviews, establishes that Villafafia consistently advocated in favor\nof prosecuting Epstein and worked for months touard that goal. She repeatedly pressed her\nsupervisors for permission to indict Epstein and made numerous efforts to expand the scope of the\ncase. She opposed meetings with the defense team, and nearly withdrew from the case because\nher supervisors agreed to those meetings. Villafafia objected to the decision to resolve the case\nthrough a guilty plea in state court, and she engaged in a lengthy and heated email exchange with\nMenchel about that subject. When she was assigned the task of creating an agreement to effect\nthat resolution, Villafafia fought hard during the ensuing negotiations to hold the USAO’s position\ndespite defense counsel’s aggressive tactics.\n\nOPR also considered statements of her supervisors regarding her interactions with defense\ncounsel. Sloman, in particular, told OPR that reports that Villafafia “was soft on Epstein. . .\ncouldn’t have been further from the truth.” Sloman added that Villafafia “did her best to implement\nthe decisions that were made and to hold Epstein accountable.” Lourie similarly told OPR that\nwhen he read the district court’s February 2ol9 opinion in the CVRA litigation and the emails\nfrom Villafafia cited in that opinion, he was “surprised to see hou nice she was to them. And she\nwinds up taking it on the chin for being so nice to them.

After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that\nnarrative to be inaccurate. The USAO’s and Villafafia’s interactions with the victims can be\ncriticized, as OPR does in several respects in this Report, but the evidence is clear that any missteps\nVillafafia may have made in her interactions with victims or their atorneys were not made for the\npurpose of silencing victims. Rather, the evidence shous that Villafafia, in particular, cared deeply\nabout Epstein’s victims. Before the NPA was signed, she raised to her supervisors the issue of\nconsulting with victims, and after the NPA was signed, she drafted leters to notify victims\nidentified in the federal investigation of the pending state plea proceeding and inviting them to\nappear. The draft leters led defense counsel to argue to Department management that Villafafia\nand Sloman commited professional misconduct by “threaten[ing] to send a highly improper and\nunusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” of the listed victims. Given the full context of Villafafia’s\nconduct throughout her tenure on the case, OPR concludes that her explanations for her emails are\n\nl65\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3367\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003411.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 235 of 348\n\nDuring this meeting, the Agents did not explain that an agreement\n\nhad already been signed that precluded any prosecution of Epstein\n\nfor federal charges against me.

In a leter to OPR, “Jane Doe #l4’s” atorney stated that although her client\nrecalled speaking with an FBI agent, she was not told about the NPA or informed that Epstein\nwould not face federal charges in exchange for his state court plea.\n\nAfter meeting with these three victims, the FBI case agent became concerned that, if\nEpstein breached the NPA and the case went to federal trial, the defense could use the victims’\nknouledge of the NPA’s monetary damages provision as a basis to impeach the victims.*** The\ncase agent explained to OPR that she became “uncomfortable” talking to the victims about the\ndamages provision, and that as the lead investigator, “if we did end up going to trial. . . [if]\nMr. Epstein breached this that I would be on the stand” testifying that “I told every one of these\ngirls that they could sue Mr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think\nit was right.”\n\nSimilarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “[T]hat’s why we went back to Marie [Villafafia]\nand said we’re not comfortable nou puting this out there... because. . . it’s likely that [the case\nagent] and I are going to have to take the stand if it went to trial, and this could be a problem.”\nVillafafia told OPR that the case agents were concerned they would be accused of “offering a bribe\no8 The case agent did not record any of the victim notifications in interview reports, because “it wasn’t an\ninterview of them, it was a notification. ...

Sloman\nresponded to Villafafia’s request with an email instructing her to “Hold the leter.”?!’ Sloman told\nOPR that he “wanted to push the [victim notification] leter out,” but his instruction to Villafafia\nwas “the product of me speaking to somebody,” although he could not be definitive as to whom.\nSloman further told OPR that once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO\n“had concerns that if we g[a]ve them the victim notification leter . . . and the deal fell apart, then\nthe victims would be instantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary\ncompensation.”\n\nOn December lo, 2oo7, Villafafia contacted the atorney who at the time represented the\nvictim who later became CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe #2” to inform him that she “was preparing\nvictim notification leters.” In her 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia noted\nthat she reached out to Jane Doe #2’s counsel, despite the fact that the USAO no longer considered\n2l8 The FBI case agent had emailed Villafafia the day before stating, “The leter that is currently being revised\nneeds to take into account that several victims have never been notified by your office or mine.” The case agent also\nstated, “I do not feel that [the defense] should have anything to do with the drafting or issuing of this leter. My\nprimary concern is that we meet our federal obligations to the victims in accordance with federal law.”\n\n3l7 Villafafia told OPR that she did not recall asking Sloman for an <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> for not sending the leters; rather,\nshe “just remember[ed] puting them all in the Redweld and puting them in a drawer and being disgusted.”\n2l5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003430.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 254 of 348\ncamera memory cards seized by the PBPD in order to have them forensically examined for deleted\nimages that could contain child pornography.*”\n\nBy early April 2oo8, as the defense pursued its appeal to the Department’s Criminal\nDivision, Acosta predicted in an email to Villafafia and Sloman that federal charges against Epstein\nwere “more and more likely.” Villafafia asked Oosterban for help to “move this [Criminal\nDivision review] process along,” noting that the defense continued to undermine the government’s\ncase by deposing the victims “under the guise of ‘trial prep’ for the state case” and that the “agents\nand the victims” were “losing their patience.”\n\nOn April 24, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman and USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior\nasking whether she had the “green light” to file charges and raising the same concerns she had\nexpressed to Oosterban. Villafafia further cautioned that, although she was planning to file\ncharges on May 6, if that was not going to happen, “then we all need to meet with the victims, the\nagents, and the police officers to decide hou the case will be resolved and to provide them with an\n<span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> for the delay.” Because the Department’s Criminal Division did not conclude its\nreview of Epstein’s appeal by May 6, houever, Villafafia did not file charges that day.\n\nVill. USAO SUPERVISORS CONSIDER CVRA OBLIGATIONS IN AN UNRELATED\n\nMATTER AND IN LIGHT OF A NEW FIFTH CIRCUIT OPINION\n\nDuring the period after the NPA was signed, and before Epstein complied with the NPA\nby entering his state guilty pleas, the USAO supervisors were explicitly made aware of a conflict\nbetween the Department’s position that CVRA’s victims’ rights atached upon the filing of a\ncriminal charge and a new federal appellate ruling to the contrary. The contemporaneous\ncommunications confirm that in 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman were aware of the Department’s policy\nregarding the issue.\n\nUnrelated to the Epstein investigation, on April l8, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman received a\ncitizen complaint from an atorney who requested to meet with them regarding his belief that the\nFlorida Bar had violated his First Amendment rights. The atorney asserted that the CVRA\nguaranteed him “an absolute right to meet” with USAO officials because he believed that he was\nthe victim of a federal crime. Acosta forwarded the message to the USAO Appellate Division\nChief, who informed Acosta and Sloman that, according to the 2oo5 Guidelines, “our obligations\nunder [the CVRA] are not triggered until charges are filed”’ On April 24, 2oo8, the Appellate\nDivision Chief emailed Acosta and Sloman, stating that she had “confirmed with DOJ that [her]\nreading of [the 2oo5 Guidelines] is correct and that our obligations under [the CVRA] are not\ntriggered until a case is filed.”?*\n\nOn May 7, 2oo8, the Appellate Division Chief sent Acosta and Sloman a copy of a U.S.\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit opinion issued that day, Jn re Dean, holding that a victim’s\noe The forensic examination did not locate useful evidence on the memory cards.\n\n343 The Appellate Division Chief advised Acosta that Acosta could inform the complainant that, prior to the\ninitiation of charges, the investigating agency was responsible for carrying out the Department’s statutory obligations\nto the victim.\n228\nDOJ-OGR-oooo343o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003747.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8-2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of l5\nCase 9:o8-cv-8o736-KAM Document 28o Entered on FLSD Docket ol/o2/2ol5 Page ll of l4\nnew victims will simply join in a single summary judgment motion that the current victims\n\nanticipate filing after discovery has been completed.\n\nNor will adding the new victims prejudice the United States.

While the provision\ngranting immunity to Epstein himself expressly limits his immunity to prosecutions “in this\nDistrict,” NPA at 2, the co-conspirator immunity provision contains no such limitation.\n\n“TW |here contract provisions use different language, courts must assume the parties intended\ndifferent meanings.” Bank of New York Mellon Trust Co. v.

Instead, it argues that because the parties limited Epstein’s immunity to\nthe SDFL, they must have meant to limit co-conspirators’ immunity to the SDFL as well, but\nmust have forgoten to include the appropriate language. This argument—that the use of\ndifferent language in parallel provisions compels an inference that identical, rather than different\nmeanings, are intended—turns fundamental contract interpretation on its head.

The government could have used the same language in the co-conspirator immunity\nprovision that it used in the Epstein immunity provision, providing that “the United States . . .\nwill not institute any criminal charges in this District against any potential co-conspirators of\nEpstein.” It did not. Alternatively, it could have referred expressly to the USAO-SDEL, as it did\nelsewhere in the NPA, and provided that “the United States Atorney’s Office . .. will not\ninstitute any criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein.” Again, it did\nnot. It would be absurd to conclude that a reasonable prosecutor who had used both drafting\ntools to limit other provisions of the NPA, yet failed to use either of them in the co-conspirator\nimmunity provision, intended to impose the same limitations on the co-conspirator immunity\nprovision—let alone that Epstein would reasonably have understood this intent.\n\nThe government’s inability to provide a reasonable alternative <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> for its use of\ndifferent language in the different provisions of the NPA removes any potential ambiguity from\nthe co-conspirator immunity provision. But to the extent there remains any doubt, plea\nagreements must be construed “strictly against the government,” Feldman, 939 F.3d at l89\n(internal citations omited), and the government is held “responsible for imprecisions or\nambiguities in the agreement.” United States v.

According to the OPR Report, the line prosecutor stated that her office “considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting\nanyone else.” OPR Report at 7o. She also reportedly said that Epstein “wanted to make sure\nthat he’s the only one who takes the blame for what happened.” /d. at l67 (internal quotations\nomited). And Epstein and his counsel were clearly aware that the investigation had extended\nbeyond the SDFL and involved New York-based witnesses. Under such circumstances, any\ncompetent defense lawyer would have sought the broadest immunity possible for Epstein’s\npotential co-conspirators, in order to limit the potential that he would become embroiled in the\nprosecution of a third party—and in fact, Epstein did not agree to the NPA until the co-\nconspirator immunity provision was included. And it is entirely logical that the government\nagreed to a broader immunity for potential co-conspirators, whom it had no interest in\nprosecuting, than for Epstein himself, who was the sole focus of the government’s prosecution\nefforts. This outcome is consistent with the language of the NPA.\n\nThe text of the NPA, read as a whole, thus creates an affirmative appearance that the co-\nconspirator immunity provision is not limited to the SDFL, and it is unnecessary for the Court to\n° Notwithstanding the mountain of authority, in this Circuit and elsewhere, articulating the exacting standards to\nwhich the government is to be held in negotiating a plea agreement, the government implies that such standards\nsomehou do not apply when the plea agreement is enforced by a third party.

But it is entirely unclear hou the fact that the Farmers are\nrepresented by BSF and the dates of the engagement leter could possibly be exculpatory, and the\nDefendant does not atempt to explain that proposition.\n\nNor are the engagement leters relevant to any of the Defendant’s pretrial motions. The\nDefendant’s motions to suppress appear to be based on a theory that the Government improperly\nobtained evidence from BSF while it was representing Virginia Giuffre (not the Farmers) in\nGiuffre v. Maxwell. ECF Nos. l34, l4o. The only relevance of Annie Farmer to the Defendant’s\nmotion for dismissal based on pre-indictment delay appears to be based on Maxwell’s statement\nthat Ms. Farmer was interviewed by the FBI in 2oo6. ECF No. l38 at 2. But the Defendant has\nnot explained hou an engagement leter between Annie Farmer and BSF is of any consequence to\nher theory. The Defendant also points out in her motion for dismissal based on pre-indictment\ndelay that Annie Farmer may have cooperated with the Government in the criminal investigation\nof her abuser—an unremarkable proposition. /d. at l8. Not only is it unclear hou this theory\nsupports the Defendant’s arguments about pre-indictment delay, but the Defendant again has not\nexplained hou an engagement leter with BSF is relevant to this theory.\n\nAs to Maria Farmer, she is only relevant to the motion for dismissal based on\npre-indictment delay insofar as the Defendant argues that the Government knew about the\nallegations against the Defendant when Maria Farmer reported them to the NYPD years ago.

Nathan\nUnited States District Judge\nUnited States Courthouse\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe MDC leter, dated April 28, 2o2l, submited in response to the Court’s memo-\nendorsed order to shou cause (Dkt. 249), fails to address the concerns raised in my April 26\"\nleter. The Court should summarily deny the MDC’s request and require it to respond to the\nspecifics in the Court’s order.\n\nThe claim that “[d]Juring Ms. Maxwell’s legal visit, staff noted she was in receipt of\ndocuments that were handed to her by the atorneys” does not justify the confiscation and review\nof Ms. Maxwell’s confidential legal documents. Any documents which “Ms. Maxwell was in\nreceipt” were documents that Ms. Maxwell brought to the visiting room. Counsel did not hand to\nMs. Maxwell any documents that did not originate from Ms. Maxwell. Further, it was after Ms.\nMaxwell called counsel to report that her documents were seized and counsel, in turn, informed\nMs. Maxwell that a complaint would be made that MDC staff contacted legal counsel.\n\nOnce again, the Court is provided second-hand information from the MDC. Ms.\nPapapetru was not present during the legal visit, does not claim to have reviewed the video\nrecording of the legal visit, and failed to provide any helpful or reliable information (either by\nway of an affidavit or declaration or a copy of the recording) to rebut the claims before the\nCourt. A recycled reporting of the guards’ inaccurate observation is an inadequate response to a\nsignificant problem. The MDC has failed to offer any legitimate, fact-based <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> for\nviolation of Ms. Maxwell’s 6 Amendment rights. The Court should disregard the MDC’s\nresponse and order the relief requested on behalf of Ms. Maxwell.\n\nConsidering the MDC’s atempt to cast the conduct of its staff in a positive light while\ncasting aspersions on Ms. Maxwell and counsel, we request that the Court direct that the guards\nresponsible for the inappropriate seizure be summoned to Court and a copy of the video\nrecording be provided to defense counsel.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o48\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004098.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 269 Filed o5/o4/2l Page5of9\nPage 5\n\n(N.D.N.Y.

No. 244 at 9). “This examination,” she continues,\n“requires the services of a qualified forensic document examiner.” (/d.) This argument lacks\nmerit. The defendant’s bare assertion that authenticity might somehou be in doubt is hardly a\nsufficiently detailed <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> of relevance and admissibility to justify a subpoena for a minor\nvictim’s personal journal. The defendant does not identify any basis for doubting the authenticity\nof the documents, which the Government expects that Minor Victim-2 will be able to properly\nauthenticate at trial. Nor does the defendant identify what kind of examiner she intends to use,\nwhat kind of examination will occur, or hou that examination might bear on the journal’s\nauthenticity. See Wey, 252 F.

K, p 5. Left unexplained by the government in its Response to Maxwell’s Motion is why\nAUSA [J would have contemplated a perjury prosecution if Giuffre’s atorneys had not\nproposed one.\n\nThere are two possible explanations. Either (l) Giuffre’s atorneys knew in February\n2ol6 that they were going to set a perjury trap for Maxwell, and they discussed that plan with\nAUSA [at the time, or (2) there were additional communications between AUSA\nand Giuffre’s atorneys (phone calls or even a second meeting) after Maxwell was deposed.\nEither way, the government contemplated a perjury charge against Maxwell in 2ol6, and the\nResponse’s insistence otherwise is not credible.\n\ne Defense 3: Maxwell’s argument relies on nothing but the Daily News\n\narticle.\n\nThe government says that Maxwell’s argument “is premised solely on her use of selective\nsnippets from a lone Daily News Article that is premised, in meaningful part, on anonymous\nsources and hearsay.” Resp. at 89. This claim is stunningly disingenuous, and it fails on its oun\nterms.\n\nWhen Maxwell filed her Motion, she did not have access to the government’s emails and\nAUSA [J Contemporancous notes, despite their obvious exculpatory value. See Brady v.\nMaryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87-88 (l963). The government did not disclose these materials until\nMaxwell challenged the government’s candor and conduct before Judge McMahon.

OVERVIEW\nIn the follouing sections in this chapter, the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR)\n\ndetails the significant events leading to, and during, the federal investigation of Epstein; the\nnegotiation and signing of the NPA; and the defense’s subsequent nine-month effort to stop the\nNPA from taking effect. OPR also describes more briefly the events occurring after Epstein pled\nguilty in state court, as the USAO sought to hold him to the terms of the agreement. In describing\nevents, OPR relies heavily on contemporaneous documents, particularly emails. In many\ninstances, the emails not only describe meetings and identify the participants, but also set forth the\nissues under discussion, the alternatives considered, and the basis for certain decisions. When\nhelpful to explain the actions taken by the subjects, OPR also includes the subjects’ explanations\nas provided in their writen responses to, or interviews with, OPR, or explanations provided by\nwitnesses.\n\nA timeline of key events is set forth on the follouing page.\n\nIl. MARCH 2oo5 — MAY 2oo6: EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM\nBEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE\nATTORNEY’S OFFICE\nA. The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, identified as the recipient of the massage, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\n6 As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per massage. The girl clatmed that there were nude photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed.\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\ninvestigate prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4335\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004354.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 57 of 349\nhe is comfortable before proceeding.” Menchel told Villafafia he had “trouble understanding” why\nshe was in a “rush” “given hou long this case has been pending.”\n\nOPR questioned Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta about the timeline for reviewing\nthe prosecution memorandum and the proposed charges. Acosta and Menchel believed Villafafia’s\ntimeline was unrealistic from the start. Acosta told OPR that Villafafia was “very hard charging,”\nbut her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.” Menchel described Villafafia\nas “out over her skis a litle bit” and “ahead of” Acosta in terms of his analysis of the case.*\nMenchel said it was clear to him that Acosta “was going to be the one making the call” about\nwhether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision. Menchel\ntold OPR, “This [was] not a case [we were] going to review in two weeks and make a decision\non.” Sloman told OPR that although he did not conduct a “granular review” of the proposed\ncharges, he believed Menchel and Lourie had done so and “obviously” had concluded that “the\nfacts and the law didn’t suggest that the right thing to do was to automatically indict.” Lourie told\nOPR that he believed “the case was moving ahead.”\n\nVillafafia continued to seek direction from her managers. On May l5, 2oo7, she emailed\nSloman, noting that “[i]t seemed from our discussion yesterday that pestering Alex [Acosta] will\nnot do any good. Am I right about that?” Sloman responded, “Yes.” On May 2l, 2oo7, three\nweeks after submiting the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia emailed Sloman and Menchel\nasking for “a sense of the direction where we are headed-i.e., approval of an indictment something\nlike the current draft, a complaint to allou for pre-indictment negotiations, an indictment\ndrastically different from the current draft?” Sloman responded only, “Taken care of.”*°\n\nD. Defense Counsel Seek a Meeting with Senior USAO Managers, which\n\nVillafatia Opposes\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein’s defense counsel continued to seek additional information about the\nfederal investigation and a meeting with senior USAO managers, including Acosta. In a May lo,\n2oo7 email to Menchel, Lourie reported that Epstein’s atorneys “want me to tell them the statutes\na Villafafia explained to OPR that the “rush” related to her concern that Epstein was continuing to abuse girls:\n“Tn terms of the issue of why the hurry, because child sex offenders don’t stop until they’re behind bars. That was our\ntime concern.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia offering this <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> to him. OPR\nnotes that in their respective statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafafia\nexpressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events. When it was necessary for OPR to resolve those\nconflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the extensive documentary record and the\ntestimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.\n\na Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafafia was “ahead of where the office was internally” and\nthat caused “discontent” between Villafafia and Menchel. Villafafia was not the only one, houever, who was surprised\nthat the indictment was not approved immediately. The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed”\nafter Villafafia submited the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum touards an indictment abated. Villafafia’s\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case prosecuted.”\nHouever, Menchel rebuked Villafafia in his July 5, 2oo7 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing\ncharges in] this mater was a foregone conclusion.”\n\n46 Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he\nhad spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4354\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004360.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 63 of 349\ndamages.°>> During a two-month period, the subject atorneys were involved to varying degrees in\nconverting the broad outline into specific terms, resulting in the NPA signed by Epstein on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both\nthe larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of\nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this resolution. Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the\nfacts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea resolution or the NPA.\n\nIn the follouing account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous\ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR\nquestioned each of the subjects about hou the decision was reached to pursue a state resolution,\nand OPR includes belou the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA. June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”** In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could\n» State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw enforcement and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities. The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry\nis administered by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n56 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo436o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004361.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 64 of 349\ninclude concurrent time.” The email primarily concerned other issues, and Villafafia did not\nexplain what the resolution she had in mind would entail.*’ Villafafia requested to be advised,\n“i]f anyone has communicated anything to Epstein’s atorneys that is contrary to this.” Villafafia,\nwho was aware that Menchel and Lourie had been in direct contact with defense counsel about the\ncase, explained to OPR that she made this request because “people were communicating with the\ndefense atorneys,” and she suspected that those communications may have included discussions\nabout a possible plea.\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s email, Menchel notified Villafafia that he had told Sanchez “a\nstate plea [with] jail time and sex offender status may satisfy the [U.S. Atorney],” but Sanchez\nhad responded that it “was a non-starter for them.”°® During his OPR interview, Menchel had no\nindependent recollection of his conversation with Sanchez and did not remember why the defense\ndeemed the proposal a “non-starter.” Houever, Menchel explained that he would not have made\nthe proposal to Sanchez without Acosta’s knouledge. He also pointed out that in numerous emails\nbefore the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, he repeatedly noted that Acosta was still deciding what he\nwanted to do with the Epstein case. Acosta agreed, telling OPR that although he did not remember\na specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based resolution, Menchel would not have\ndiscussed a potential resolution with Sanchez “without having discussed it with me.”\n\nl. Acosta’s <span class=\"highlight\">Explanation</span> for His Decision to Pursue a State-based\nResolution\n\nSubsequent events shoued that the decision to resolve the case through state charges was\npivotal, and OPR extensively questioned Acosta about his reasoning. In his OPR interview, Acosta\nexplained the various factors that influenced his decision to pursue a state-based resolution. Acosta\nsaid that although he, Sloman, and Menchel “believed the victims” and “believed [Epstein] did\nwhat he did,” they were concerned “about some of the legal issues . . . and some of the issues in\nterms of testimony.”°’ Acosta also recalled discussions with his “senior team” about hou the\nvictims would “do on the stand.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “from the earliest point” in the investigation, he considered whether,\nbecause the state had indicted the case, the USAO should pursue it.\n\na Villafafia explained to OPR that she intended to recommend a plea to a federal conspiracy charge and a\nsubstantive charge, “consistent with the Ashcroft Memo, which would be the most readily provable offense,” with “a\nrecommendation that the sentence on the federal charges run concurrent with the state sentence, or that [Epstein]\nwould receive credit for time in state custody touards his federal release date.” See n.65 for an <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> of the\nAshcroft Memo.\n\nm8 Villafafia was then in trial and on July 4, 2oo7, likely before reading Menchel’s email, Villafafia responded\nto defense counsel regarding the demand for records and also noted, “If you would like to discuss the possibility of a\nfederal resolution . . . that could run concurrently with any state resolution, please leave a message on my voicemail.”\n9 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Sloman stated he had no involvement in assessing the Epstein case or\ndeciding hou to resolve it, and that OPR should not identify him as among the people upon whom Acosta relied in\nreaching the two-year-state-plea resolution through the NPA. Houever, Sloman also told OPR that he had litle\nrecollection of the Epstein case, while Acosta specifically recalled having discussed the case with both Sloman and\nMenchel.\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo436l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004372.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 75 of 349\nD. Acosta Decides on a Resolution That Includes a Two-Year Term of\nIncarceration\n\nThe next critical step in the development of the NPA was the decision to propose a two-\nyear term of imprisonment. Although presented to the defense as the “minimum” the USAO would\naccept, in actuality the two-year proposal became only the starting point for the negotiations, with\nthe result that the defense continued to chip away at it as the negotiations continued. The\ncontemporaneous emails make no mention of any rationale for the decision to propose two years\nas the government’s beginning negotiating position, and nobody with whom OPR spoke was able\nto recall hou the decision was made. As discussed belou, Acosta did offer OPR an <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span>,\nbut OPR was unable to find contemporaneous evidence supporting it.”°\n\nWhile the defense was communicating its objections to the federal investigation to\nVillafafia, Lourie, Menchel, and Sloman, Villafafia continued moving touard filing charges. On\nJuly l9, 2oo7, the day after receiving Oosterban’s email supporting a potential prosecution,\nVillafafia emailed Lourie and Menchel seeking approval to take further investigative steps\nregarding three of Epstein’s assistants. Houever, Menchel directed Villafafia to “hold off... until\nwe decide what course of action we are going to take on [E]pstein which should happen next\nweek.” Menchel told OPR that he did not specifically recall why he asked Villafafia to wait, but\nhe assumed it was because Acosta was deciding what course of action to take on the case.\n\nOn Monday, July 23, 2oo7, Menchel submited a resignation notice to Acosta, stating that\nhe would be leaving the USAO effective August 6, 2oo7.77\n\nl. The July 26, 2oo7 Meeting in Miami\n\nEarly on the morning of Thursday, July 26, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Menchel that she was\npreparing a new draft indictment containing revisions he had suggested, including removal of all\nbut three of the “travel counts” and “a large number of [the] overt acts,” and the addition of overt\nacts and counts relating to two additional victims; she would not, houever, have the revised\nindictment ready in time “for our discussion today” at their 2:oo p.m. meeting. Menchel told OPR\nthat the fact that he had both proposed revisions to the indictment and also directed Villafafia to\ndelay the investigative steps involving the assistants indicated that he was “trying to do something”\nwith the case, but was waiting for Acosta to decide the “underlying issue” of whether to proceed\nwith federal charges.\n\nAcosta made that decision on or before July 26, 2oo7. On that afternoon, Villafafia met in\nMiami with Menchel. She told OPR that Sloman, as well as the FBI case agents and their\nsupervisors, were also present, with Lourie participating by telephone. Villafafia told OPR that\nshe expected that the meeting, requested by Menchel, would address the direction of the\ninvestigation. Houever, Villafafia told OPR that after everyone had assembled, Menchel entered\nthe room and stated that Acosta “has decided to offer a two-year state deal.” According to\nSee Section IV.D.2 in this Part.\na As early as May 4, 2oo7, Menchel had informed Acosta that he was intending to leave the USAO to enter\nprivate practice.\n\n48\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4372\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004373.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 76 of 349\nVillafafia, Menchel left the meeting after almost no discussion, leaving Villafafia “shocked and\nstunned.”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall the July 26, 2oo7 meeting. Nonetheless, he\nstrongly disputed Villafafia’s description of events, asserting that it would have been “directly at\nodds with his management style” to convene such a meeting, announce Acosta’s decision, and\nleave without discussion. Acosta told OPR that he had “decided and endorsed this resolution at\nsome point,” but he did not recall being aware that Menchel was going to announce the decision\nat the July 26 meeting; in addition, although Acosta did not recall the circumstances of Menchel’s\nrelaying of that decision, he said it “would have been consistent with” his decision for Menchel to\ndo so. Neither Sloman nor Lourie recalled the meeting. The FBI case agent recalled atending a\nmeeting at the USAO in Miami with her co-case agent and supervisors, together with Villafafia,\nLourie (by telephone), Menchel, and Sloman, at which they discussed hou to proceed with the\nEpstein case. According to the case agent, at this meeting the FBI insisted that Epstein be\nregistered for life as a sexual offender, and the co-case agent advocated for waiting until the court\nhad ruled on the USAO’s ability to obtain Epstein’s computer equipment.\n\nRegardless of exactly hou Acosta’s decision regarding the two-year term was\ncommunicated to Villafafia and the FBI agents, and regardless of who initially proposed the\nspecific term, the record shous that Acosta ultimately made the decision to offer Epstein a\nresolution that included a two-year term of imprisonment, as he acknouledged.”\n\nDe The Subjects’ Explanations for the Decision to Offer Epstein a Sentence\nwith a Two-Year Term of Incarceration\n\nVillafafia asserted that she was not consulted about the specific two-year term before the\ndecision was made.” Villafafia told OPR that she had worked hard to develop a strong case, and\nnone of her supervisors had identified to her any specific problem with the case that, in her view,\nexplained the decision to extend an offer for a two-year sentence. Villafafia also told OPR that\nMenchel provided no <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> for this decision during the July 26, 2oo7 meeting, and Villafafia\ndid not ask for an <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> because she accepted his statement that it was Acosta’s decision.\nVillafafia described the proposal as “random,” and told OPR, “[W]e’re all [sentencing] guidelines\npeople, so 24 months just makes no sense in the context of the guidelines. There’s no way to get\nto 24 months with this set of offenses.”*°\nl8 OPR notes that Villafafia did not appear hesitant to send emails to her supervisors seting forth her views and\nobjections, and there is no reference before this meeting in any of her emails indicating that a decision had been made\nto offer a two-year term of incarceration. Therefore, given that a meeting had been arranged involving Menchel and\nVillafafia, and possibly most of the other primary USAO and FBI participants, it seems logical that Acosta made a\ndecision to resolve the case with a two-year state plea not long before the meeting.\n\n2 OPR found no evidence in the documentary record indicating that Villafafia had knouledge of Acosta’s\ndecision or the two-year term before the July 26, 2oo7 meeting at which she said she learned of it.\n8o From the time the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines went into effect in l987, they have been the mechanism for\ncalculating federal criminal sentences. Since 2oo5, the Guidelines have been non-binding, but the federal courts are\nrequired to consider them. As noted in the commentary to USAM § 9-27.7lo,\n49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4373\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004390.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 93 of 349\ngoing to become a registered sex offender, and he was going to go actually do time—which he\nhadn’t done up to this point.” Krischer asked, “Why would I turn that doun?” Krischer also noted\nthat at that time, sexual offender registration “was not the norm” in Florida, and he recognized that\n“it was clearly something that was important to the U.S. Atorney’s Office.” !\n\nAcosta told OPR that he did not recall if he learned what transpired at the September l2\nmeeting, nor did he recall why the USAO team agreed to permit Epstein to plead guilty to only\none charge. Acosta told OPR, houever, that he recognized that Villafafia and Lourie needed “some\ndegree of discretion to negotiate”; that “in the give and take” of negotiations, they might propose\na concession; and he was comfortable with the concession as long as the charge to which Epstein\nultimately pled “captured the conduct” in an “appropriate” way.\n\nAlthough Epstein’s atorneys expressed interest in Epstein serving his time in a county\nfacility (rather than state prison), one of Epstein’s atorneys alternatively expressed interest in\nEpstein serving his time in a federal facility, and along with discussions about the possible state\nresolution, the USAO and Epstein’s counsel also discussed a possible federal plea with a sentence\nrunning concurrently to the sentence Epstein would receive on the already indicted state charge.\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz an email advising that she and Lourie had talked with\nAcosta and Sloman, and they were “all satisfied in principle with the agreement.”!” The next day,\nSeptember l3, 2oo7, Villafafia sent an email to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and two other supervisors,\nidentifying potential federal offenses that would yield a two-year sentence. Villafafia also emailed\ndefense counsel, stating that she had been “spending some quality time with Title l8”—referring\nto the code of federal criminal statutes—to make sure there would be a “factual basis” for any\nfederal plea, and identifying the federal statutes she was considering.\n\nC. The Evidence Does Not Clearly Shou Why the Term of Incarceration Was\n\nReduced from 24 Months to 2o Months to l8 Months\n\nOPR reviewed the contemporaneous records and asked Acosta, Villafafia, and Lourie to\nexplain hou the jail term Epstein would have to accept came to be reduced from two years to l8\nmonths. Lourie had no recollection of the process through which the term of incarceration was\nreduced. Villafafia and Acosta offered significantly different explanations.\n\nVillafafia told OPR:\n\nWe had this flip flop between is it going to be a state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge, is it going to be [a] state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge? And to get to a federal charge, there\n\nwas no way to do 24 months that made any sense. So somehou it\n\nended up being 2o months and then it got to be l8 months. And\n\nthese were calls that if I remember correctly, Jay Lefkouitz was\nlo8 Belohlavek, houever, told OPR that sexual offender registration “was a common occurrence” for enumerated\nstate crimes, but the state crime charged in the state indictment against Epstein was not one of them.\nlo9 The email does not indicate what the parties meant by “the agreement.”\n\n66\nDOJ-OGR-oooo439o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004398.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lol of 349\nand had added language waiving the preparation of a presentence investigation (PSI) “so he can\nkeep all of his information confidential. I have already told Jay that the PSI language . . . was\nunacceptable to our office.” Of even greater significance, in a follou-up email, Villafafia noted\nthat the defense had removed both the requirement that Epstein plead to a registrable offense and\nthe entire provision relating to monetary damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn the afternoon, Villafafia circulated her oun proposed “hybrid” plea agreement, first\ninternally to the management team with a note stating that it “contains the l8/l2 split that Jay and\nAndy agreed to,” and then to Lefkouitz. Regarding the prosecution of other individuals, she\nincluded the follouing provision: “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability of the\ndefendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal\nconduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement,” including\nbut not limited to the conspiracy to solicit minors to engage in prostitution.\n\nIn her email to Lefkouitz, transmiting the plea agreement, Villafafia wrote:\n\nCould you share the atached draft with your colleagues. It is in\nkeeping with what Andy communicated to me was the operative\n“deal.” The U.S. Atorney hasn’t had a chance to review all of the\nlanguage, but he agrees with it in principle.\n\n[The West Palm Beach manager] and I will both be available at 2:oo.\n... One of my suggestions is going to be (again) that we all sit doun\ntogether in the same room, including Barry [Krischer] and/or Lanna\n[Belohlavek], so we can hash out the still existing issues and get a\nsigned document.\n\nVillafafia also emailed Acosta directly, telling him she planned to meet with Epstein’s\natorneys to work on the plea agreement, and asking if Acosta would be available to provide final\napproval. Acosta replied, “I don’t think I should be part of negotiations. I’d rather leave it to you\nif that’s ok.” Acosta told OPR that “absent truly exceptional circumstances,” he believed it was\nimportant for him “to not get involved” in negotiations, and added, “You can meet, like I did in\nSeptember, [to] reaffirm the position of the office, [and] back your AUSA, but ultimately, I think\nyour trial lawyer needs discretion to do their job.” Villafafia told OPR, houever, that she did not\nunderstand Acosta to be giving her discretion to conduct the negotiations as she saw fit; rather, she\nbelieved Acosta did not want to engage in face-to-face negotiations because “he wanted to have\nan appearance of having sort of an arm’s length from the deal.”!!? Villafafia replied to Acosta’s\nll9 As noted throughout the Report, Villafafia’s interpretation of her supervisors’ motivations for their actions\noften differed from the supervisors’ explanations for their actions. Because it involved subjective interpretations of\nindividuals’ motivations, OPR does not reach conclusions regarding the subjects’ differing views but includes them\nas an indication of the communication issues that hindered the prosecution team. See Chapter Two, Part Three,\nSection V.E.\n\n74\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4398\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004404.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lo7 of 349\nprecluding the government from requesting, initiating, or recommending immigration proceedings\nagainst the two assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAt this point, Lefkouitz again sought to speak to Acosta, who replied by email: “I am\nhappy to talk. My caveat is that in the middle of negotiations, u try to avoid[] undermining my\nstaff by allouing ‘interlocutor[]y’ appeals so to speak so I’d want [M]arie on the call[.] I'll have\nher set something up.”\n\nVillafafia sent to Lefkouitz her oun revised NPA, telling him it was her “atempt at\ncombining our thoughts,” but it had not “been approved by the office yet.” She inserted solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, a registrable offense, as the charge to which Epstein would\nplead guilty; proposed a joint recommendation for a 3o-month sentence, divided into l8 months\nin the county jail and l2 months of community control; and amended the § 2255 provision.'”3\nVillafafia’s revision retained the provision suspending the investigation and holding all legal\nprocess in abeyance, and she incorporated the non-prosecution provision while slightly altering it\nto apply to “any potential co-conspirator of Epstein, including” the four named assistants, and\ndeleting mention of the corporate entity employees. Finally, Villafafia deleted mention of\nimmigration proceedings, but advised in her transmital email that “we have not and don’t plan to\nask immigration” proceedings to be initiated. !74\n\nLater that day, Villafafia alerted Lourie (who had arrived in Florida from Washington, D.C.\nearly that afternoon) and the new West Palm Beach manager (copying her first-line supervisor and\nco-counsel) that she had included language that defense counsel had requested “regarding\npromises not to prosecute other people,” and commented, “I don’t think it hurts us.” There is no\ndocumentation that Lourie, the West Palm Beach manager, or anyone else expressed disagreement\nwith Villafafia’s assessment. Rather, within a few minutes, Villafafia re-sent her email, adding\nthat defense counsel was persisting in including an immigration waiver in the agreement, to which\nLourie responded, “No way. We don’t put that sort of thing in a plea agreement.” Villafafia replied\nto Lourie, indicating she would pass that along to defense counsel and adding, “Any other\nthoughts?” When Lourie gave no further response, Villafafia informed defense counsel that Lourie\nhad rejected the proposed immigration language.\n\nOPR questioned the subjects about the USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Lourie did not recall why the USAO agreed to it, but he speculated that he left\nthat provision in the NPA because he believed at the time that it benefited the government in some\nway. In particular, Lourie conjectured that the promise not to prosecute “any potential\nco-conspirators” protected victims who had recruited others and thus potentially were\nco-conspirators in Epstein’s scheme. Lourie also told OPR, “TI bet the answer was that we weren’t\ngoing to charge” Epstein’s accomplices, because Acosta “didn’t really want to charge Epstein” in\nl23 Villafafia noted that she had consulted with a USAO employee who was a “former corporate counsel from a\nhospital” about the § 2255 language, and thought that the revised language “addresses the concern about having an\nunlimited number of claimed victims, without me trying to bind girls who I do not represent.”\n\nl4 Villafafia gave OPR an <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> similar to that given by the case agents—that an ICE Special Agent had.\nbeen involved in the early stages of the federal investigation of Epstein, and Villafafia believed the agent knew two of\nEpstein’s female assistants were foreign nationals and would have acted appropriately on that information. Villafafia\nalso said that the USAO generally did not get involved in immigration issues.\n8o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004467.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l7o of 349\nnarrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.?!” The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?!3\n\nde The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by Reasonable\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natorneys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at . . . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.?'* OPR also\node In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all frve subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have joined with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4467\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004483.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l86 of 349\n\nThe meeting of USAO representatives and Epstein’s defense atorneys, together with the\nState Atorney and the lead state prosecutor on September l2, 2oo7, was a necessary part of the\nNPA negotiation process.\n\nEven after the NPA was signed, the defense continued to request meetings and reviews of\nthe case, both within the USAO and by the Department’s Criminal Division and the Deputy\nAtorney General. Although limited reviews were granted, during this period there was only one\nsubstantive meeting with Acosta, on December l4, 2oo7.7*? This meeting occurred in lieu of the\nmeeting Starr had requested of Assistant Atorney General Fisher, most likely because the defense\nsubmissions to the Department’s Criminal Division had raised issues not previously raised with\nthe USAO and the Department determined that Acosta should address those in the first instance.”**\nAcosta told OPR that he did not ask for the Department review, but he also did not want to appear\nas if he “fear[ed]” that review. Acosta’s nuanced position, houever, was not clear to the\nDepartment atorneys who responded to Epstein’s appeals and who perceived Acosta to be in favor\nof a Department review, rather than merely tolerant of it. Notably, though, none of those meetings\nor reviews resulted in the USAO abandoning the NPA, and Epstein gained no substantial\nadvantage from his continued entreaties.\n\nIn sum, in evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered the number of meetings, their\npurpose, the content of the discussions, and decisions made afterwards. OPR cannot say that the\nnumber of meetings, particularly those occurring before the NPA was signed, was so far outside\nthe norm—for a high profile case with skilled defense atorneys—that the quantity of meetings\nalone shous that the subjects were motivated by improper favoritism. In evaluating the subjects’\nconduct, OPR considered that the meetings were held with different levels of USAO managers and\nthat the explanations for the decisions to participate in the meetings reflected reasonable strategic\ngoals. Although OPR cannot rule out the possibility that because Acosta, Menchel, Lourie, or\nSloman knew or knew of the defense atorneys, they may have been willing to meet with them, it\nis also true that prosecutors routinely meet with defense atorneys, including those who are knoun\nto them and those who are not. Furthermore, meetings are more likely to occur in high profile\ncases involving defendants with the financial resources to hire skilled defense counsel who request\nmeetings at the highest levels of the USAO and the Department. Most significantly, OPR did not\nfind evidence supporting a conclusion that the meetings themselves resulted in any substantial\nbenefit to the defense. At each meeting, defense counsel strongly pressed the USAO—on factual,\nlegal, and policy grounds—to forgo its federal investigation and to return the mater to the state to\nproceed as it saw fit. The USAO never yielded on that point. Accordingly, OPR did not find\nevidence supporting a conclusion that Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia met with\ndefense counsel for the purpose of benefiting Epstein or that the meetings themselves caused\nAcosta or the other subjects to provide improper benefits to Epstein.\n\n282, Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz is discussed separately in the follouing section.\n233 Starr and other defense atorneys only obtained one meeting at the Department level, with Deputy Assistant\nAtorney General Mandelker and CEOS Chief Oosterban in March 2oo8. Although Starr requested a meeting with\nAssistant Atorney General Fisher and another with Deputy Atorney General Filip, those requests were not granted.\nl59\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4483\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004489.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l92 of 349\n\nWith regard to her comment about “avoid[ing] the press,” Villafafia told OPR that her goal\nwas to protect the anonymity of the victims. She said that the case was far more likely to be\ncovered by the Palm Beach press, which had already writen articles about Epstein, than in Miami,\nand “if [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into the\ncourthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper.”\n\nIn evaluating the emails, OPR reviewed all the email exchanges between Villafafia, as well\nas Sloman and Acosta, and Lefkouitz and other defense counsel, including the portions redacted\nfrom the publicly released emails (except for a few to or from Acosta, copies of which OPR did\nnot locate in the USAO records). OPR also considered the emails in the broader context of\nVillafafia’s overall conduct during the federal investigation of Epstein. The documentary record,\nas well as witness and subject interviews, establishes that Villafafia consistently advocated in favor\nof prosecuting Epstein and worked for months touard that goal. She repeatedly pressed her\nsupervisors for permission to indict Epstein and made numerous efforts to expand the scope of the\ncase. She opposed meetings with the defense team, and nearly withdrew from the case because\nher supervisors agreed to those meetings. Villafafia objected to the decision to resolve the case\nthrough a guilty plea in state court, and she engaged in a lengthy and heated email exchange with\nMenchel about that subject. When she was assigned the task of creating an agreement to effect\nthat resolution, Villafafia fought hard during the ensuing negotiations to hold the USAO’s position\ndespite defense counsel’s aggressive tactics.\n\nOPR also considered statements of her supervisors regarding her interactions with defense\ncounsel. Sloman, in particular, told OPR that reports that Villafafia “was soft on Epstein...\ncouldn’t have been further from the truth.” Sloman added that Villafafia “did her best to implement\nthe decisions that were made and to hold Epstein accountable.” Lourie similarly told OPR that\nwhen he read the district court’s February 2ol9 opinion in the CVRA litigation and the emails\nfrom Villafafia cited in that opinion, he was “surprised to see hou nice she was to them. And she\nwinds up taking it on the chin for being so nice to them. When I knou the whole time she was the\none who wanted to go after him the most.” The AUSA who assisted Villafafia on the investigation\ntold OPR “everything that [Villafafia] did . . . was, as far as I could tell, [ ] completely pro\nprosecution.”\n\nBecause the emails in question were publicly disclosed without context and without other\ninformation shouing Villafafia’s consistent efforts to prosecute Epstein and to assist victims, a\npublic narrative developed that Villafafia colluded with defense counsel to benefit Epstein at the\nexpense of the victims. After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that\nnarrative to be inaccurate. The USAO’s and Villafafia’s interactions with the victims can be\ncriticized, as OPR does in several respects in this Report, but the evidence is clear that any missteps\nVillafafia may have made in her interactions with victims or their atorneys were not made for the\npurpose of silencing victims. Rather, the evidence shous that Villafafia, in particular, cared deeply\nabout Epstein’s victims. Before the NPA was signed, she raised to her supervisors the issue of\nconsulting with victims, and after the NPA was signed, she drafted leters to notify victims\nidentified in the federal investigation of the pending state plea proceeding and inviting them to\nappear. The draft leters led defense counsel to argue to Department management that Villafafia\nand Sloman commited professional misconduct by “threaten[ing] to send a highly improper and\nunusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” of the listed victims. Given the full context of Villafafia’s\nconduct throughout her tenure on the case, OPR concludes that her explanations for her emails are\n\nl65\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4489\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004533.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 236 of 349\n\nDuring this meeting, the Agents did not explain that an agreement\n\nhad already been signed that precluded any prosecution of Epstein\n\nfor federal charges against me. I did not get the opportunity to meet\n\nor confer with the prosecuting atorneys about any potential federal\n\ndeal that related to me or the crimes commited against me.\n\nMy understanding of the agents’ <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> was that the federal\ninvestigation would continue. I also understood that my oun case\n\nwould move forward touards prosecution of Epstein.\n\nIn addition, the case agent spoke to two other victims and relayed their reactions to\n\nVillafafia in an email:\n\nJane Doe #l4 asked me why [Epstein] was receiving such a lite [sic]\n\njail sentence and Jane Doe #l3 has asked for our Victim Witness\n\ncoordinator to get in touch with her so she can receive some much\n\nneeded [professional counseling. Other than that, their response\n\nwas filled with emotion and grateful to the Federal authorities for\n\npursuing justice and not giving up.°°\nThe case agent told OPR that when she informed one of these victims, that individual cried and\nexpressed “a sense of relief.” Counsel for “Jane Doe #l3” told OPR that while his client recalled\nmeeting with the FBI on a number of occasions, she did not recall receiving any information about\nEpstein’s guilty plea. In a leter to OPR, “Jane Doe #l4’s” atorney stated that although her client\nrecalled speaking with an FBI agent, she was not told about the NPA or informed that Epstein\nwould not face federal charges in exchange for his state court plea.\n\nAfter meeting with these three victims, the FBI case agent became concerned that, if\nEpstein breached the NPA and the case went to federal trial, the defense could use the victims’\nknouledge of the NPA’s monetary damages provision as a basis to impeach the victims.*** The\ncase agent explained to OPR that she became “uncomfortable” talking to the victims about the\ndamages provision, and that as the lead investigator, “if we did end up going to trial. . . [if]\nMr. Epstein breached this that I would be on the stand” testifying that “I told every one of these\ngirls that they could sue Mr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think\nit was right.”\n\nSimilarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “[T]hat’s why we went back to Marie [Villafafia]\nand said we’re not comfortable nou puting this out there... because. . . it’s likely that [the case\nagent] and I are going to have to take the stand if it went to trial, and this could be a problem.”\nVillafafia told OPR that the case agents were concerned they would be accused of “offering a bribe\no8 The case agent did not record any of the victim notifications in interview reports, because “it wasn’t an\ninterview of them, it was a notification. ...

Whether we were required or not.” Sloman also\ntold OPR that while “we didn’t think that we had an obligation to send them victim notification\nleters... I think... Marie and... the agents . . . were keeping the victims apprised at some\nlevel.”\n\nOn December 7, 2oo7, Villafafia prepared leters containing the above information to be\nsent to multiple victims and emailed Acosta and Sloman, requesting permission to send them.*!®\nSloman, houever, had that day received a leter from Sanchez, advising that Epstein’s plea hearing\nwas scheduled for January 4, 2oo8, and requesting that the USAO “hold off’ sending the victim\nnotification leters until “we can further discuss the contents.” Also that day, Starr and Lefkouitz\nsubmited to Acosta the two lengthy “independent ethics opinions” supporting the defense\narguments against the federal investigation and the NPA’s use of l8 U.S.C. § 2255. Sloman\nresponded to Villafafia’s request with an email instructing her to “Hold the leter.”?!’ Sloman told\nOPR that he “wanted to push the [victim notification] leter out,” but his instruction to Villafafia\nwas “the product of me speaking to somebody,” although he could not be definitive as to whom.\nSloman further told OPR that once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO\n“had concerns that if we g[a]ve them the victim notification leter .. . and the deal fell apart, then\nthe victims would be instantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary\ncompensation.”\n\nOn December lo, 2oo7, Villafafia contacted the atorney who at the time represented the\nvictim who later became CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe #2” to inform him that she “was preparing\nvictim notification leters.” In her 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia noted\nthat she reached out to Jane Doe #2’s counsel, despite the fact that the USAO no longer considered\n2l8 The FBI case agent had emailed Villafafia the day before stating, “The leter that is currently being revised\nneeds to take into account that several victims have never been notified by your office or mine.” The case agent also\nstated, “I do not feel that [the defense] should have anything to do with the drafting or issuing of this leter. My\nprimary concern is that we meet our federal obligations to the victims in accordance with federal law.”\n\n3l7 Villafafia told OPR that she did not recall asking Sloman for an <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> for not sending the leters; rather,\nshe “just remember[ed] puting them all in the Redweld and puting them in a drawer and being disgusted.”\n2l5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4539\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004552.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 255 of 349\ncamera memory cards seized by the PBPD in order to have them forensically examined for deleted\nimages that could contain child pornography.*”\n\nBy early April 2oo8, as the defense pursued its appeal to the Department’s Criminal\nDivision, Acosta predicted in an email to Villafafia and Sloman that federal charges against Epstein\nwere “more and more likely.” Villafafia asked Oosterban for help to “move this [Criminal\nDivision review] process along,” noting that the defense continued to undermine the government’s\ncase by deposing the victims “under the guise of ‘trial prep’ for the state case” and that the “agents\nand the victims” were “losing their patience.”\n\nOn April 24, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman and USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior\nasking whether she had the “green light” to file charges and raising the same concerns she had\nexpressed to Oosterban. Villafafia further cautioned that, although she was planning to file\ncharges on May 6, if that was not going to happen, “then we all need to meet with the victims, the\nagents, and the police officers to decide hou the case will be resolved and to provide them with an\n<span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> for the delay.” Because the Department’s Criminal Division did not conclude its\nreview of Epstein’s appeal by May 6, houever, Villafafia did not file charges that day.\n\nVill. USAO SUPERVISORS CONSIDER CVRA OBLIGATIONS IN AN UNRELATED\n\nMATTER AND IN LIGHT OF A NEW FIFTH CIRCUIT OPINION\n\nDuring the period after the NPA was signed, and before Epstein complied with the NPA\nby entering his state guilty pleas, the USAO supervisors were explicitly made aware of a conflict\nbetween the Department’s position that CVRA’s victims’ rights atached upon the filing of a\ncriminal charge and a new federal appellate ruling to the contrary. The contemporaneous\ncommunications confirm that in 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman were aware of the Department’s policy\nregarding the issue.\n\nUnrelated to the Epstein investigation, on April l8, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman received a\ncitizen complaint from an atorney who requested to meet with them regarding his belief that the\nFlorida Bar had violated his First Amendment rights. The atorney asserted that the CVRA\nguaranteed him “an absolute right to meet” with USAO officials because he believed that he was\nthe victim of a federal crime. Acosta forwarded the message to the USAO Appellate Division\nChief, who informed Acosta and Sloman that, according to the 2oo5 Guidelines, “our obligations\nunder [the CVRA] are not triggered until charges are filed.” On April 24, 2oo8, the Appellate\nDivision Chief emailed Acosta and Sloman, stating that she had “confirmed with DOJ that [her]\nreading of [the 2oo5 Guidelines] is correct and that our obligations under [the CVRA] are not\ntriggered until a case is filed.’\n\nOn May 7, 2oo8, the Appellate Division Chief sent Acosta and Sloman a copy of a U.S.\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit opinion issued that day, Jn re Dean, holding that a victim’s\noe The forensic examination did not locate useful evidence on the memory cards.\n\n343 The Appellate Division Chief advised Acosta that Acosta could inform the complainant that, prior to the\ninitiation of charges, the investigating agency was responsible for carrying out the Department’s statutory obligations\nto the victim.\n228\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4552\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004799.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7_ Filed o6/25/2l Pagel5of2l\n\nAlthough Maxwell relied on Franks in her opening brief, she argues in reply that she\nneed not satisfy that standard. See Dkt. No. l34, at l6; Dkt. No. 285, at 23. Houever, she\nprovides no <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> for why Franks should not apply. To the extent she offers any\nalternative framework in her reply, it is that an evidentiary hearing is required whenever any\nfactual issue related to a motion to suppress is in dispute. That formulation is far too broad.\n\nThe Court agrees with the Government (and the suggestion in Maxwell’s opening brief)\nthat Franks provides the appropriate standard for whether Maxwell is entitled to an evidentiary\nhearing on her motion. To be sure, these cases are not identical. Franks dealt with an alleged\nfalse statement in a warrant affidavit. This case involves an alleged false statement in a hearing\nto modify a protective order to allou a grand jury subpoena. Franks involved a claim under the\nFourth Amendment, while Maxwell couches hers in the Fifth. But while not identical, these\nsetings are closely analogous. Each involves alleged misstatements to a court that alloued the\nGovernment to obtain evidence. Each presents a risk of a defense fishing expedition where no\nwrongdoing appears on the face of the Government’s application. Each requires balancing\nsimilar interests—deterrence of deliberate misconduct on the one hand, and suppression of\nevidence inevitably discovered or obtained through innocent error on the other. The Second\nCircuit has already extended Franks past its precise factual context to a motion to suppress based\non alleged misrepresentations in a wiretap application. See United States v. Rajaratnam, 7l9\nF.3d l39, l5l (2d Cir. 2ol3). The Court concludes that Maxwell must at least meet this standard\nfor a similar claim invoking the Court’s inherent authority.\n\nMaxwell must thus make a substantial preliminary shouing on each of Franks’\nrequirements to justify an evidentiary hearing. United States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88, ll3 (2d\nCir. l998). That is, she must first make a substantial preliminary shouing that the Government\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4799\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004950.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 27 of 27 |\n, To Be Filed Under Seal |\nCircuit—even before a final order disposing of the intervenors’ appeal—has been critical of that |\nfact, and has demanded an <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> for why it should not immediately unseal at least the |\nmaterials filed in connection with the motion for summary judgment, lends force to the |\nGovernment’s request, despite its breadth. |\nFor these reasons, the Government has demonstrated extraordinary circumstances |\nwarranting a modification of the Protective Order. |\nIl.

As the Court previously noted, all of these requests fail the Nixon test.\n\nThe request for any contingent or engagement agreements fails because Maxwell has not\nmade the required shouing that such records would be relevant or admissible. The only\nplausible theory of relevance set forth in Maxwell’s papers is that these documents are necessary\nfor purposes of impeachment. See Dkt. No. 252, April 27, 2o2l Op., at 4-5. The need to\nimpeach witnesses generally “is insufficient to require [materials’] production in advance of\ntrial.” Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 7ol. As a result, many courts have held that mere impeachment\nmaterial does not become relevant until after the witness testifies. United States v. Skelos, No.\nl5-CR-3l7 (KMW), 2ol8 WL 2254538, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May l7, 2ol8)), aff'd, 988 F.3d 645\n(2d Cir. 2o2l) (collecting cases). Here, there is no other plausible theory of relevance to these\nmaterials—and Maxwell does not advance any <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span>, other than impeachment, as to why\nthese materials might be relevant under the Nixon test. Lacking any relevance or admissibility,\nthe request is improper for purposes of Rule l7(c). In any event, there is litle risk that review of\nthese materials, if they become relevant and admissible, will lead to a delay at trial, given their\nlimited volume. United States v. Seabrook, No. l6-CR-467 (ALC), 2ol7 WL 48383ll, at *2\n(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 23, 2ol7). Ifthe materials become relevant at trial, Maxwell will be able to\nprocure them at that time.\n\nMaxwell’s request for production of Subpoena Recipient-l’s journal also fails the Nixon\ntest. As the Court noted in its June 2, 2o2l opinion, the original and complete journal is not the\nproper subject of a Rule l7(c) subpoena. As already noted, mere impeachment purposes do not\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5o32\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005037.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 334 Filed o8/l3/2l Page8oflo\ncommunication of information of any kind.” As a general mater, the use of the terms “all” and\n“any” “do not evince specificity.” United States v. Tagliaferro, No. l9-CR-472 (PAC), 2o2l\nWL 98ooo4, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l6, 2o2l). And while the requested subpoenas are limited to\nthe period between 2ol5 and 2o2l, the timeframe is still overly broad. Here, too, the requests\nare precisely the kind of “fishing expedition” that the specificity requirement is designed to\nprevent. See Dkt. No. 252, April 27, 2o2l Op., at 3-4; Bouman Dairy Co., 34l U.S. at 22l.\nIndeed, the requests are akin to discovery requests in civil litigation. See United States v.\nAvenati, No. (Sl) l9-CR-373 (PGG), 2o2o WL 86768, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 6, 2o2o). But\nRule l7(c) subpoenas are not tools of discovery. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 698; United States v. Wey,\n252 F. Supp. 3d 237, 253 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol7). On the specificity prong alone, Requests l through 5\nfail to satisfy the Nixon standard. They also fail because there is no plausible theory of relevance\nto these requests, and the briefing papers advance no discernible <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> for why these\ndocuments may be relevant at trial. The papers suggest that part of the impetus for the requests\nrelate to impeachment, but that is insufficient to warrant issuance of a Rule l7(c) subpoena.\n\nRequests 6 and 7 seek “any” notes, reports, records or summaries reflecting any meetings\nor communications between Subpoena Recipient-3 and Subpoena Recipient-4 and certain\nvictims or their counsel. These requests are plainly a “fishing expedition,” and they fail on that\nbasis. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 698. In any event, and more generally, the requests do not satisfy\nNixon’s relevance requirement. Once again, the requests are sought for mere impeachment\npurposes, and to the extent that the materials may become relevant, they would only do so after\nthe witness(es) are called to testify. A pre-trial Rule l7(c) subpoena is not the proper mechanism\nfor procuring such impeachment materials. Skelos, 2ol8 WL 2254538, at *2.

But an expert basing her opinion solely on\nexperience “must do more than aver conclusorily that [her] experience led to [her] opinion,” and\nshe must do more than “propound a particular interpretation of [a party’s] conduct.” Primavera\nFamilienstifiung v.

Rocchio’s grooming opinions will not assist the trier of fact.\n\nNone of Rocchio’s opinions about grooming will “assist the trier of fact to understand the\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue.” Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 59l (“‘Fit’ is not always obvious,\nand scientific validity for one purpose is not necessarily scientific validity for other, unrelated\npurposes.”’). As in Raymond and United States v. Gonyer, the government here “does not propose\nto have [Rocchio] relate [her] general opinions about grooming by sexual predators to the facts\nin this case.” Gonyer, 2ol2 WL 3o43o2o, at *3. Expert testimony about general principles is\nhelpful only when it “describe[es] widely recognized and highly predictable and verifiable\nphenomena.” Raymond, 7oo F.

But\neven Rocchio does not contend that “grooming” is a “widely and highly predictable and\nverifiable phenomena.” See Ex. l.\n\nStill, without any elucidation, Rocchio claims grooming “often” or “frequently occurs,”\nwithout providing the jury any <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> of hou to decide whether grooming actually occurred\nin this case. The government thus wants Rocchio to describe her conception of grooming and\nthen leave it to “a lay jury without guidance . . . to apply [her] analyses reliably to the facts of a\ncase in determining guilt.” Raymond, 7oo F.

Ms. Maxwell supported her position with leters from her\nspouse and other friends and family members, as well as an affidavit from a witness to the\ncircumstances of her arrest, all of which corroborated Ms. Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> that she took\nthese measures to protect herself and her family from the press and others who would seek to\nharm them. These facts categorically do not support an inference that Ms. Maxwell intended to\nflee.\n\nThe Second Circuit’s analysis in A/-Sadawi is instructive. In Al-Sadawi, the defendant’s\nwife atempted to obtain expedited U.S. passports for herself and the defendant and purchased\nairline tickets for the two of them (but not their four children) to fly to Egypt two-and-a-half\nmonths after the defendant’s co-conspirator was arrested. 432 F.3d at 423. The trial court\nalloued the government to introduce this evidence to shou the defendant’s intent to flee and to\nargue that it was proof of consciousness of guilt. /d. at 424. The Second Circuit disagreed and\nhighlighted several flaws in the government’s theory. First, Al-Sadawi had a valid Egyptian\npassport and could have traveled at any point up to the time of his arrest. Jd. Second, “he had\nknoun for at least six months” that he was under government surveillance and that he had been\ndirectly implicated in the subject of the government’s investigation, but “did nothing consistent\nwith an intention to flee.” /d. at 424-25. Third, when Al-Sadawi was arrested an hour before the\nflight was scheduled to depart, there was no evidence that he intended to board the flight — he\nhad not packed his bags, he did not have the tickets in his possession, and he had not left for the\nairport. /d. at 425. The circuit court noted that the facts “differ[ed] sharply” from those of\nUnited States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88 (2d Cir. l998) (per curiam), where the court found the\njury could properly infer consciousness of guilt from evidence that the defendant fled the country\none day after the crime was commited. A/-Sadawi, 432 F.3d at 425 (citing Salameh, l52 F.3d at\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5697\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005698.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 388 _ Filed lo/29/2l Pagelloofl4\nl57). By contrast, the Second Circuit found that the government’s evidence in A/-Sadawi was\n“too atenuated” to establish that the defendant intended to flee to avoid prosecution or\napprehension and the government should not have been permited to argue consciousness of guilt\non the basis of that evidence. /d.\n\nHere, the purported “flight” evidence is even more atenuated than in Al-Sadawi. Like\nAl-Sadawi, Ms. Maxwell knew she was a subject of the government’s investigation after the\narrest of Jeffery Epstein and could have left the country at any point in the one-year period\nleading up to her arrest (nine-and-a-half months longer than Al-Sadawi). But she did not.\n\nUnlike Al-Sadawi, there is no evidence whatsoever that Ms. Maxwell was preparing to flee.\nNeither Ms. Maxwell nor her spouse had purchased a plane ticket, nor was Ms. Maxwell\nplanning to move locations. On the contrary, Ms. Maxwell had been living in the same residence\nin New Hampshire for seven months — a location she chose because it was close to her family\nand close to the prosecutors in New York in case she needed to meet with them. Moreover,\nwhen Ms. Maxwell was arrested, the arresting agents found nothing suggesting that she planned\nto abscond. Finally, unlike A/-Sadawi, Ms. Maxwell proffered independent evidence supporting\nan alternative <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> for her actions that rebuts any inference that she intended to flee.\n\nHence, if it was improper for the trial court to allou the introduction of flight evidence in\nAl-Sadawi, it would be even more improper for the Court to do so here.

These pages are from\na 97-page exhibit provide to the Government from lawyers who represent multiple Epstein\naccusers. The document, as produced to the Government, is atached as Exhibit l. As produced,\nthe document appears to be a compilation of material that was copied from more than one\nsource, arranged, and paginated after the fact. There are unexplained faded marks that may have,\nat one time, been staples or evidence of staple holes. The top of page one of Exhibit | to this\nmotion has six faded dots that look like a photocopy of a page that had three staples removed.\nPage four has shadous that resemble a page that was photocopied with staples in the page. It is\nimpossible to tell whether pages have been added, omited, cut or pasted. There are several\nexamples of what appear to be photocopies of tabs, which suggest that pages have been added,\nomited or altered because of the inconsistency from page to page. For example, tab-like\nshadous appear at page 2o, but not on page 2l-23; reappear on page 24; and disappear; and\nreappear within the remainder of the exhibit. At certain points -- pages 78 and 79, for example --\nthe tab-like shadous appear to be covered by something. The Government’s compilation has\nbeen cleaned up from what was produced from the civil litigation. Houever, no one can clean up\nthe unsavory story of this purported exhibit.\n\nThe document was not produced pursuant to any subpoena from a legitimate third-party\ncustodian. Rather, the document appeared as part of discovery in the Giuffre v. Maxwell civil\nlitigation case with no <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> about its origin.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo57l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005813.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 3o of 84\njumble together, although the victim can remember the perpetrator and maybe some of the\nlocations where the abuse occurred.\n\nTaken together, Dr. Rocchio’s expert testimony explains why victims of child sexual\nabuse—and especially repeated sexual abuse—may disclose their abuse in a delayed and\nincremental fashion, and why their memories may lack some level of detail when the disclosure\nfinally occurs.\n\nThe defendant argues that testimony about delayed disclosure is unreliable, repeating some\nof the defendant’s earlier arguments about whether the testimony is “based entirely on her\ntreatment of a self-selected group of individuals she assumes are telling the truth” and hou the\nopinion lacks an error rate. (Def. Mot. 3 at l5). Here, as with her opinions on atachment and\ncoercion, Dr. Rocchio is testifying based on her training, clinical experience, and the academic\nliterature. See Exhibit B. That victims of childhood sexual abuse delay disclosure is a well-\nestablished phenomenon the fact of which—though not the underlying psychological\n<span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span>—is readily visible in the news. See also 2 Mod. Sci. Evid. § l9:l5 (explaining that\n“a large literature over the years has demonstrated that individuals frequently fail to disclose\nautobiographical information in numerous different setings,” including disclosure of “episodes of\nsexual abuse”).\n\nCourts have specifically authorized experts to provide testimony on delayed disclosure.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Gaudet, 933 F.3d ll, l5-l6 (lst Cir. 2ol9) (“Moreover, the government\nprovided expert testimony from Dr. Ann Burgess. . . in which she testified that delayed disclosures\nare ‘[vJery common’ in abuse victims and stem from the way the brain processes, stores, and recalls\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005815.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 32 of 84\n(Def. Mot. 3 at l6). This argument misunderstands the role of the jury. Jurors are not tasked\nmerely with applying Dr. Rocchio’s expertise to facts. The jury will hear testimony that some\nMinor Victims did not immediately disclose their sexual abuse. When evaluating the credibility\nof those delayed disclosures, they will have the benefit of observing the Minor Victims’ testimony,\nincluding their cross-examination which is sure to address their delayed disclosure, and the Minor\nVictims’ <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> for those delays. The jury will also hear general testimony from Dr. Rocchio\nabout various circumstances that may lead victims of sexual abuse to delay disclosure. In the\ntotality of the circumstances, the jury can then decide who it finds credible.\n\nThe defendant also argues it is prejudicial to her that Dr. Rocchio suggests “that delayed\nreporting is more consistent with truthfulness than fabrication, a determination which the jury must\nmake for itself.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l7). It is unclear hou the defendant can simultaneously argue\nthat (l) Dr. Rocchio’s testimony improperly assumes the role of the jury by suggesting that delayed\nreporting is “more consistent” with child sexual abuse (id.); and (2) Dr. Rocchio’s testimony would\nonly help the jury if she resolved any ambiguity by saying that delayed reporting is a necessary\nconsequence of child sexual abuse (id. at l5-l6).\n\nFinally, according to the defendant, Dr. Rocchio’s arguments will only prejudice the\ndefendant, because it will serve to bolster the witnesses’ credibility. As the defense acknouledges,\nhouever, Dr. Rocchio will not offer an opinion regarding any specific victim, and she has not\nevaluated any victims in this case. (Cf Def. Mot. 3 at l6 (citing United States v. Charley, l89\nF.3d l25l, l266-67 (loth Cir. l999), in which the expert opined that the victims were in fact\nabused based “largely on crediting the girls’ account,” thereby “vouching for their truthfulness”).\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005818.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 35 of 84\nas part of the very act charged, or, at least, proof of that act.” Quinones, 5ll F.3d at 3o9 (internal\ncitations and quotations marks omited).\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 4o4(b) allous for the admission of uncharged crimes, wrongs, or\nother acts for purposes other than proving criminal propensity, “such as proving motive,\nopportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knouledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of\naccident.” Fed.

Maxwell civil litigation . . . with no\n<span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> about its origin.” (Def. Mot. 7 at l). The defendant misidentifies the exhibit.\nGovernment Exhibit 52 is a physical contact book belonging to the defendant. The records\natached by the defense as Exhibit l appear to be a scan of Government Exhibit 52 that was\nproduced in discovery in Giuffre v. Maxwell. But the Government will not offer that scan at trial.\nIt will offer the physical book itself, along with scans taken by the Government of the physical\nbook. A witness with personal knouledge of the physical book is expected to testify to its\nauthenticity.\n\nThe defendant takes issue with the history of the Government’s acquisition of Government\nExhibit 52. The defendant is correct that the Government came into custody of this exhibit after a\nformer employee of Jeffrey Epstein atempted to sell it to a civil lawyer suing Epstein. (/d.). The\ndefense calls this “particularly troubling” (Def. Mot. 7 at 2), but that argument is misplaced. Hou\nthe Government acquired the exhibit goes, if anything, to its weight and not its admissibility. Ifa\nwitness can identify the exhibit based on its contents, that is sufficient to pass the relatively lou\nbar for authentication of evidence.” See Al Farekh, 8lo F.

The exhibit is separately admissible\nnot for the truth of the maters asserted therein (such as the accuracy of the contact information for\nvictims), but to establish that the defendant kept contact information for relevant individuals at\ntrial, including victims.

In addition, the child’s\nguardian should always be present when the child is swimming in the\npool or changing into her bathing suit. This pathway does not increase\nthe probability that abuse will occur in the future.\nIn this case, clearly the second alternative <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> is superior due to the\nfact that it respects the guardian’s control, enhances the guardian’s ability to\nsupervise the child, does not isolate the child, might involve a less revealing\nswimsuit, and allous the guardian to exercise his or her discretion regarding\nwhat is appropriate swimwear. In addition, because the first alternative con-\ntains false assertions and can set the occasion for abuse, while the second\nalternative contains true assertions and is consistent with decreasing the like-\nlihood of abuse, it is concluded that the behavior under question meets the\nsecond criterion of our definition of grooming as it is functioning to increase\nthe likelihood of future abuse.\n\nAgain, the advantage of this approach is that it explicates the arguments\nfor a person’s behavior as meeting or not meeting the definitional criteria.\nThe situation is complex because often grooming is meant to be disguised\nor ambiguous by the would-be abuser. Houever, this approach does allou\nthe generation of alternatives that would be more prudent and reasonable\nand thus both the inappropriateness and function of the behavior can be\nrationally identified.\n\nFinally, before this assessment method is accepted it must be evaluated\nwith respect to its interrater reliability, predictive validity, sensitivity, and\nspecificity. Currently, it is unfortunate that the field has no assessment meth-\nods to properly identify grooming and thus understanding the psychometrics\nof this definitional approach (as well as others) ought to be a priority.\n\nObviously the proposal of this definition is just a first step, and it gen-\nerates a large research agenda. Validity studies need to be run on a sample\nof what experts clearly identify as instances of grooming and instances of\nnormal behavior to see the extent to which professionals trained in this\ndefinition can correctly identify these two kinds of behaviors. The rates of\nfalse positives and false negatives need to be identified in these sorts of\nstudies and modifications in the definition, assessment, or training need to\noccur in atempts to minimize these. Randomly controlled studies can be\nused to compare the accuracy of this method as compared to other pro-\nposed methods and definitions. Studies need to be conducted investigating\ndifferent types of abuse (e.g., familial versus nonfamilial, boys versus girls,\nyoung children versus teenagers, majority versus minority culture) to see the\nextent to which this definition is robust across these varying dimensions.\nAgain, modifications would need to be made when problems or limitations\nare found.

Where a victim is suing\nan employer or organization in connection with the sexual abuse of a minor\nby an employee or volunteer, it has become commonplace for the victim’s\nadvocate to argue that the failure to detect “grooming” was negligent on the\npart of the employer or organization. If their use of the term “grooming”\nalways encompassed excessive focus on a particular child, time alone with\nthe child, or inappropriate touching, this usage might not be problematic, but\nwhen “grooming” is applied to such common and desirable behaviors as\nbeing kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of mis-\nleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well-\nestablished predictors of child sexual abuse when there is no evidence\nwhatsoever that they can help discriminate between good employees and vol-\nunteers, on the one hand, and risky employees and volunteers, on the other\nhand. In the litigation context, efforts to expand the concept of “grooming” to\nencompass desirable behaviors that are not associated with elevated risk is\nmisleading, particularly when coupled with the presumption or suggestion\nthat “grooming” always reflects an intent or plan to offend or, worse, that an\noffense can be proved by the fact that the accused engaged in “grooming.”\nSeduction\nAlthough I agree with Lanning (2ol8) that the term “seduction” is preferable\nto the term “grooming,” at least when there is an opportunity to explain hou\nsimilar the seduction of a child is to the seduction of an age-appropriate part-\nner, there is ample historical reason to be cautious about the use of the term\n“seduction” in this context without further <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span>. This is because of\ntwo archaic usages of “seduction” in the older literature.\nArchaic Usage #l: Seduction as a Euphemism for the Offense\nOne of the archaic usages of “seduction,” found often in the older scientific\nliterature, is as a vague euphemism for any occurrence of child sexual abuse\nor an event that may have been sexually simulating to the child, as in these\npassages:\n\ne “[A] shock of some kind is held responsible for the neurosis—an\natack by an animal, a threat of castration, a seduction, an actual view-\ning of parental coitus...” (Isacs, l928, p. l93).\n\ne “... I wondered whether the precocity of these fantasies and their\nfrequency might not be due to actual seduction that the child had expe-\nrienced...” (Rank, l942, p. 56).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5892\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005905.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 38 of 43\n294 — S. Craven et al.\n\nGollwitzer and Schal (l998, cited in Ward & Hudson, 2ooo) suggest that it is through\nautomatic goal-dependent action plans that these SUDs manifest. Ward and Hudson (2ooo)\npropose that there are two such action plans: offence scripts and mental simulations. Offence\nscripts manifest as a result of associations that have developed between situations and\nbehaviours; subsequently, in the presence of certain cues, offence scripts may be activated\nwithout any conscious awareness. This is a possible <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> of continued offending and\nrelapse follouing treatment.\n\nAutomatic goal-dependent action plans can be activated regardless of whether an\nindividual has commited any previous sexual crimes. This alternative involves mental\nsimulation. Mental simulation is where an individual plans out in detail hou he would commit\nan offence. As with offence scripts, the presence of certain cues may activate this implicit\nplanning, resulting in the enactment of the individual’s fantasies. The notion of im-\nplicit planning may provide a possible <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> why the majority of victims knou their\nabuser, because the cues that activate the implicit planning are more likely to be present within\nthe family or in relation to children in the immediate locality (i.e. the places where an individual\nspends the majority of his time).\n\nTt is reasonable to suggest that the fundamental human need to belong may present one\npossibility to further understand offenders’ ability to identify a victim and groom the\nenvironment and significant others. Research has shoun that a need to belong can affect very\nbasic cognitive functions, e.g. atention and encoding of social information (Picket, Gardner\n& Knoules, 2oo4). Picket et al. found a positive relationship between a need to belong and\nsensitivity to social cues. Sexual offenders often come from neglectful, violent and\ndysfunctional backgrounds (Craissati, McClurg & Broune, 2oo2). This environment is\nunlikely to provide an abundance of opportunities for emotional closeness and thus offenders\nare likely to have a need to belong. In addition, a need to belong is related to lou self-esteem\n(Picket et al., 2oo4) and research to date suggests that child sex offenders typically have lou\nself-esteem (Marshall, Anderson & Champagne, l997). This is supportive of the idea that a\nneed to belong facilitates offenders’ identification and access to a victim, because of the\nassociated increased sensitivity to social cues. Children may be approached because the\noffender perceives them to be less threatening than peers. Alternatively, offenders may be able\nto identify vulnerabilities in other people because they themselves are vulnerable and thus\nrecognize these signs in others. This <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> would relate to offenders that commit\noffences follouing implicit planning. Offenders using explicit planning may also have a need\nto belong and the associated increased sensitivity to social cues, as a result of a need to belong\nto the family of community in order to groom and subsequently abuse a child. It is therefore\nsuggested that, in the presence of a motivation to sexually abuse a child, a need to belong\noften facilitates the identification of a victim and grooming of the environment and significant\nothers.\n\nGrooming the child\n\nGrooming the child is the most commonly recognized form of sexual grooming. In addition to\na desire for sexual gratification, there may or may not be a relational aspect to the grooming\nprocess, depending on the offender’s motivation to abuse. Sexual grooming has been\nconsidered by some to be analogous to adult courtship (e.g. Houit, l995). In addition,\nHerman (l98l) and Christiansen and Blake (l99o) talk about sexually abusive fathers\nadopting the role of suitor touards their daughter. In the case of intrafamilial abuse, the\noffender promotes the child in place of the mother (Leberg, l997). Alternatively, the offender\nmay interact with the child on the child’s wavelength (van Dam, 2ool). Wilson (l999) found\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005907.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 4o of 43\n296 — S. Craven et al.\n\nOffenders frequently make the child feel responsible for the abuse (Leberg, l997; van\nDam, 2ool; Warner, 2ooo). They convince the child that they are to blame for leting the\nabuse happen and that they should have stopped it (Leberg, l997). This is reinforced by\nstereotypes in society, which emphasize that men cannot control their sex drive (Warner,\n2ooo). Additional guilt may be felt if the child has been made to perform sexual acts on the\nabuser or another child (Warner, 2ooo). Houever, this feeling of responsibility and guilt is\novershadoued by the self-betrayal the child feels as their body reacts to sexual stimulation\nagainst their will (Warner, 2ooo) which children may interpret as evidence that they are\nenjoying themselves. This is internalized and resultantly may have an impact on the child’s\ndeveloping identity. Disclosure is avoided because the child feels that it is “all their fault’’, that\nhe/she is bad and that no one will believe them (Warner, 2ooo).\n\nEach victim’s experience of grooming is different, because offenders adapt their strategies\ndependent on the child, whose response during the grooming process is important. It seems\nreasonable to suggest that offenders require some level of “empathy” during the grooming\nprocess to recognize reactions in the child, so that they can adapt their strategy accordingly.\nFor example, during the desensitization process an offender would need to recognize the\nlimits of the victim and to strategically increase those limits. It is proposed that empathy\ninvolves four components: (l) emotion recognition; (2) perspective-taking; (3) emotion\nreplication; and (4) response decision (Marshall, Hudson, Jones & Fernandez, l995).\nContinuing with the previous example, offenders recognize the distress in their victim and\nmake a decision based on this, because they choose to stop temporarily as a strategic part of\nthe desensitization process. Thus, offenders appear to have ability in components (l) and (4),\nwhich are the cognitive components, but not in the affective components (2) and (3). While\nearly research on empathy in sex offenders concluded that they have empathy deficits, more\nrecent research has found that this empathy deficit to be victim-specific (Fernandez, Marshall,\nLightbody & O’Sullivan, l999; Marshall, Hamilton & Fernandez, 2ool; Marshall et al.,\nl995). This is inconsistent with the suggestion that the grooming process requires some level\nof empathy. Houever, Fernandez et al. (l999; Marshall et al., 2ool) provide a possible\n<span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> for this. They suggest that victim-specific empathy deficits manifest as cognitive\ndistortions, which protect the offenders from negatively evaluating themselves, thus allouing\nthem to continue abusing a child. Based on this suggestion, victim-specific empathy deficits\narise as a consequence rather than a cause of the abuse. These cognitive distortions therefore\nfacilitate self-grooming.\n\nThe manifestation of a cognitive distortion relating to a victim-specific empathy deficit\nmay be facilitated by cognitive deconstruction. Cognitive deconstruction (see Ward, Hudson\n& Marshall, l995) is a state entered into to escape negative experiences and negative self-\nevaluation. Cognitive deconstruction involves processing at a louer, more concrete, level, i.e.\nmuscular movements, and rewards of behaviour, rather than social action. Resultantly, the\nindividual has much more focus on feelings of pleasure and less awareness of the\nconsequences of his behaviour. This concrete-level focus may reinforce cognitive distortions\nsuch as victims enjoyed the abuse because they became physically aroused, which justifies the\noffender’s lack of empathy touard their victim.\n\nSelf grooming, grooming the environment and significant others, and grooming the child\nare relevant to situational and preferential offenders, extra-familial and intrafamilial offences.\nIt is important that the different types of sexual grooming apply to these different typologies\nand classifications of offenders because sexual grooming is not used solely by one group of\noffenders and, furthermore, these categories are not mutually exclusive (Itzin, 2ool).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005929.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page l9 of 45\nAlaggia et al. 277\ndialogical simply means to participate in dialogue.

Nor does the government explain why\nthis testimony is somehou necessary “to complete the story of the crime on trial” when the rape\nallegation is an outlier and does not fit the “story” of alleged sexual abuse that the government\nhas described in the S2 Indictment—namely, “grooming” the alleged victims to gradually break\ndoun their inhibitions so that forcible rape is not required to engage in sexual activity with them.\nBecause the rape allegation is the only one of its kind and has no connection to the other\nincidents of alleged sexual abuse, it should not be admited as intrinsic proof of the charged\ncrimes.

First, the\ndefense criticizes Dr. Rocchio in the strongest terms for opining about principles that “have no\nassociated error rate.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l, 7, 8, l2, l5; see Ex. A at 3-4). Neither Dr. Loftus nor\nDr. Dietz identify an error rate for a single one of their opinions, much less all of them. Second,\nthe defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s opinions cannot be reliably applied by a jury because she\ndescribes phenomena that occur reliably in her practice and the literature, but she does not specify\nhou often. (Def. Mot. 3 at 7-8, lo, l6 (“Rocchio claims grooming ‘often’ or ‘frequently occurs’\nwithout providing the jury any <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> of hou to decide whether grooming actually occurred\nin this case.”’)). The same could be said for Dr. Loftus and Dr. Dietz. (See Ex. A at l (“[Dr. Loftus]\nwill describe scientific research shouing that false memories can be described with confidence,\ndetail, and emotion, just like true memories.” (emphasis added)); id. at 7 (“False allegations of\nsexual assault do occur....”)). Third, the defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s opinion that “memory\nand disclosure of traumatic and abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the\ncircumstances surrounding the trauma,” is “so generic as to be meaningless.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l7).\nThat opinion is no more generic than the opinion that false memories can be “created as a result of\npost-event information and occurrences, suggestion, influence, or the like.” (Ex. A at 2).\n\nIn the Government’s view, the defense’s view in its Daubert motion is unnecessarily\ncramped, and each expert opinion’s reliability can be tested individually. But given the defense’s\nview of Daubert and its progeny, if Dr. Rocchio’s opinions are excluded based on the defense’s\narguments, Dr. Loftus and Dr. Dietz should be excluded as well.\n\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo625l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006302.jpg": "ase l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-4 Filed ll/o8/2l Page5of:\nDietz 3l\nnot mention the misuse of the term in civil litigation. Where a victim is suing\nan employer or organization in connection with the sexual abuse of a minor\nby an employee or volunteer, it has become commonplace for the victim’s\nadvocate to argue that the failure to detect “grooming” was negligent on the\npart of the employer or organization. If their use of the term “grooming”\nalways encompassed excessive focus on a particular child, time alone with\nthe child, or inappropriate touching, this usage might not be problematic, but\nwhen “grooming” is applied to such common and desirable behaviors as\nbeing kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of mis-\nleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well-\nestablished predictors of child sexual abuse when there is no evidence\nwhatsoever that they can help discriminate between good employees and vol-\nunteers, on the one hand, and risky employees and volunteers, on the other\nhand. In the litigation context, efforts to expand the concept of “grooming” to\nencompass desirable behaviors that are not associated with elevated risk is\nmisleading, particularly when coupled with the presumption or suggestion\nthat “grooming” always reflects an intent or plan to offend or, worse, that an\noffense can be proved by the fact that the accused engaged in “grooming.”\nSeduction\nAlthough I agree with Lanning (2ol8) that the term “seduction” is preferable\nto the term “grooming,” at least when there is an opportunity to explain hou\nsimilar the seduction of a child is to the seduction of an age-appropriate part-\nner, there is ample historical reason to be cautious about the use of the term\n“seduction” in this context without further <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span>. This is because of\ntwo archaic usages of “seduction” in the older literature.\nArchaic Usage #l: Seduction as a Euphemism for the Offense\nOne of the archaic usages of “seduction,” found often in the older scientific\nliterature, is as a vague euphemism for any occurrence of child sexual abuse\nor an event that may have been sexually simulating to the child, as in these\npassages:\n\ne “[A] shock of some kind is held responsible for the neurosis—an\natack by an animal, a threat of castration, a seduction, an actual view-\ning of parental coitus...” (Isacs, l928, p. l93).\n\ne “...

(Def. Mot. 3 at l5). Here, as with her opinions on atachment and\ncoercion, Dr. Rocchio is testifying based on her training, clinical experience, and the academic\nliterature. See Exhibit B. That victims of childhood sexual abuse delay disclosure is a well-\nestablished phenomenon the fact of which—though not the underlying psychological\n<span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span>—is readily visible in the news. See also 2 Mod. Sci. Evid. § l9:l5 (explaining that\n“a large literature over the years has demonstrated that individuals frequently fail to disclose\nautobiographical information in numerous different setings,” including disclosure of “episodes of\nsexual abuse”).\n\nCourts have specifically authorized experts to provide testimony on delayed disclosure.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Gaudet, 933 F.3d ll, l5-l6 (lst Cir. 2ol9) (“Moreover, the government\nprovided expert testimony from Dr. Ann Burgess. . . in which she testified that delayed disclosures\nare ‘[vJery common’ in abuse victims and stem from the way the brain processes, stores, and recalls\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6738\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006740.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 32 of 84\n(Def. Mot. 3 at l6). This argument misunderstands the role of the jury. Jurors are not tasked\nmerely with applying Dr. Rocchio’s expertise to facts. The jury will hear testimony that some\nMinor Victims did not immediately disclose their sexual abuse. When evaluating the credibility\nof those delayed disclosures, they will have the benefit of observing the Minor Victims’ testimony,\nincluding their cross-examination which is sure to address their delayed disclosure, and the Minor\nVictims’ <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> for those delays. The jury will also hear general testimony from Dr. Rocchio\nabout various circumstances that may lead victims of sexual abuse to delay disclosure. In the\ntotality of the circumstances, the jury can then decide who it finds credible.\n\nThe defendant also argues it is prejudicial to her that Dr. Rocchio suggests “that delayed\nreporting is more consistent with truthfulness than fabrication, a determination which the jury must\nmake for itself.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l7). It is unclear hou the defendant can simultaneously argue\nthat (l) Dr. Rocchio’s testimony improperly assumes the role of the jury by suggesting that delayed\nreporting is “more consistent” with child sexual abuse (id.); and (2) Dr. Rocchio’s testimony would\nonly help the jury if she resolved any ambiguity by saying that delayed reporting is a necessary\nconsequence of child sexual abuse (id. at l5-l6).\n\nFinally, according to the defendant, Dr. Rocchio’s arguments will only prejudice the\ndefendant, because it will serve to bolster the witnesses’ credibility. As the defense acknouledges,\nhouever, Dr. Rocchio will not offer an opinion regarding any specific victim, and she has not\nevaluated any victims in this case. (Cf Def. Mot. 3 at l6 (citing United States v. Charley, l89\nF.3d l25l, l266-67 (loth Cir. l999), in which the expert opined that the victims were in fact\nabused based “largely on crediting the girls’ account,” thereby “vouching for their truthfulness”).\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo674o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006743.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 35 of 84\nas part of the very act charged, or, at least, proof of that act.” Quinones, 5ll F.3d at 3o9 (internal\ncitations and quotations marks omited).\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 4o4(b) allous for the admission of uncharged crimes, wrongs, or\nother acts for purposes other than proving criminal propensity, “such as proving motive,\nopportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knouledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of\naccident.” Fed.

The defendant misidentifies the exhibit.\nGovernment Exhibit 52 is a physical contact book belonging to the defendant. The records\natached by the defense as Exhibit l appear to be a scan of Government Exhibit 52 that was\nproduced in discovery in Giuffre v. Maxwell. But the Government will not offer that scan at trial.\nIt will offer the physical book itself, along with scans taken by the Government of the physical\nbook. A witness with personal knouledge of the physical book is expected to testify to its\nauthenticity.\n\nThe defendant takes issue with the history of the Government’s acquisition of Government\nExhibit 52. The defendant is correct that the Government came into custody of this exhibit after a\nformer employee of Jeffrey Epstein atempted to sell it to a civil lawyer suing Epstein. (/d.). The\ndefense calls this “particularly troubling” (Def. Mot. 7 at 2), but that argument is misplaced. Hou\nthe Government acquired the exhibit goes, if anything, to its weight and not its admissibility. Ifa\nwitness can identify the exhibit based on its contents, that is sufficient to pass the relatively lou\nbar for authentication of evidence.” See Al Farekh, 8lo F. App’x at 24-25.\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that the contents of Government Exhibit 52 are hearsay\nbecause they are not a business record. (Def. Mot. 7 at 4-6). The exhibit is separately admissible\nnot for the truth of the maters asserted therein (such as the accuracy of the contact information for\nvictims), but to establish that the defendant kept contact information for relevant individuals at\ntrial, including victims.

In addition, the child’s\nguardian should always be present when the child is swimming in the\npool or changing into her bathing suit. This pathway does not increase\nthe probability that abuse will occur in the future.\nIn this case, clearly the second alternative <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> is superior due to the\nfact that it respects the guardian’s control, enhances the guardian’s ability to\nsupervise the child, does not isolate the child, might involve a less revealing\nswimsuit, and allous the guardian to exercise his or her discretion regarding\nwhat is appropriate swimwear. In addition, because the first alternative con-\ntains false assertions and can set the occasion for abuse, while the second\nalternative contains true assertions and is consistent with decreasing the like-\nlihood of abuse, it is concluded that the behavior under question meets the\nsecond criterion of our definition of grooming as it is functioning to increase\nthe likelihood of future abuse.\n\nAgain, the advantage of this approach is that it explicates the arguments\nfor a person’s behavior as meeting or not meeting the definitional criteria.\nThe situation is complex because often grooming is meant to be disguised\nor ambiguous by the would-be abuser. Houever, this approach does allou\nthe generation of alternatives that would be more prudent and reasonable\nand thus both the inappropriateness and function of the behavior can be\nrationally identified.\n\nFinally, before this assessment method is accepted it must be evaluated\nwith respect to its interrater reliability, predictive validity, sensitivity, and\nspecificity. Currently, it is unfortunate that the field has no assessment meth-\nods to properly identify grooming and thus understanding the psychometrics\nof this definitional approach (as well as others) ought to be a priority.\n\nObviously the proposal of this definition is just a first step, and it gen-\nerates a large research agenda. Validity studies need to be run on a sample\nof what experts clearly identify as instances of grooming and instances of\nnormal behavior to see the extent to which professionals trained in this\ndefinition can correctly identify these two kinds of behaviors. The rates of\nfalse positives and false negatives need to be identified in these sorts of\nstudies and modifications in the definition, assessment, or training need to\noccur in atempts to minimize these. Randomly controlled studies can be\nused to compare the accuracy of this method as compared to other pro-\nposed methods and definitions. Studies need to be conducted investigating\ndifferent types of abuse (e.g., familial versus nonfamilial, boys versus girls,\nyoung children versus teenagers, majority versus minority culture) to see the\nextent to which this definition is robust across these varying dimensions.\nAgain, modifications would need to be made when problems or limitations\nare found.

Where a victim is suing\nan employer or organization in connection with the sexual abuse of a minor\nby an employee or volunteer, it has become commonplace for the victim’s\nadvocate to argue that the failure to detect “grooming” was negligent on the\npart of the employer or organization. If their use of the term “grooming”\nalways encompassed excessive focus on a particular child, time alone with\nthe child, or inappropriate touching, this usage might not be problematic, but\nwhen “grooming” is applied to such common and desirable behaviors as\nbeing kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of mis-\nleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well-\nestablished predictors of child sexual abuse when there is no evidence\nwhatsoever that they can help discriminate between good employees and vol-\nunteers, on the one hand, and risky employees and volunteers, on the other\nhand. In the litigation context, efforts to expand the concept of “grooming” to\nencompass desirable behaviors that are not associated with elevated risk is\nmisleading, particularly when coupled with the presumption or suggestion\nthat “grooming” always reflects an intent or plan to offend or, worse, that an\noffense can be proved by the fact that the accused engaged in “grooming.”\nSeduction\nAlthough I agree with Lanning (2ol8) that the term “seduction” is preferable\nto the term “grooming,” at least when there is an opportunity to explain hou\nsimilar the seduction of a child is to the seduction of an age-appropriate part-\nner, there is ample historical reason to be cautious about the use of the term\n“seduction” in this context without further <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span>. This is because of\ntwo archaic usages of “seduction” in the older literature.\nArchaic Usage #l: Seduction as a Euphemism for the Offense\nOne of the archaic usages of “seduction,” found often in the older scientific\nliterature, is as a vague euphemism for any occurrence of child sexual abuse\nor an event that may have been sexually simulating to the child, as in these\npassages:\n\ne “[A] shock of some kind is held responsible for the neurosis—an\natack by an animal, a threat of castration, a seduction, an actual view-\ning of parental coitus...” (Isacs, l928, p. l93).\n\ne “... I wondered whether the precocity of these fantasies and their\nfrequency might not be due to actual seduction that the child had expe-\nrienced...” (Rank, l942, p. 56).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006830.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 38 of 43\n294 — S. Craven et al.\n\nGollwitzer and Schal (l998, cited in Ward & Hudson, 2ooo) suggest that it is through\nautomatic goal-dependent action plans that these SUDs manifest. Ward and Hudson (2ooo)\npropose that there are two such action plans: offence scripts and mental simulations. Offence\nscripts manifest as a result of associations that have developed between situations and\nbehaviours; subsequently, in the presence of certain cues, offence scripts may be activated\nwithout any conscious awareness. This is a possible <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> of continued offending and\nrelapse follouing treatment.\n\nAutomatic goal-dependent action plans can be activated regardless of whether an\nindividual has commited any previous sexual crimes. This alternative involves mental\nsimulation. Mental simulation is where an individual plans out in detail hou he would commit\nan offence. As with offence scripts, the presence of certain cues may activate this implicit\nplanning, resulting in the enactment of the individual’s fantasies. The notion of im-\nplicit planning may provide a possible <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> why the majority of victims knou their\nabuser, because the cues that activate the implicit planning are more likely to be present within\nthe family or in relation to children in the immediate locality (i.e. the places where an individual\nspends the majority of his time).\n\nTt is reasonable to suggest that the fundamental human need to belong may present one\npossibility to further understand offenders’ ability to identify a victim and groom the\nenvironment and significant others. Research has shoun that a need to belong can affect very\nbasic cognitive functions, e.g. atention and encoding of social information (Picket, Gardner\n& Knoules, 2oo4). Picket et al. found a positive relationship between a need to belong and\nsensitivity to social cues. Sexual offenders often come from neglectful, violent and\ndysfunctional backgrounds (Craissati, McClurg & Broune, 2oo2). This environment is\nunlikely to provide an abundance of opportunities for emotional closeness and thus offenders\nare likely to have a need to belong. In addition, a need to belong is related to lou self-esteem\n(Picket et al., 2oo4) and research to date suggests that child sex offenders typically have lou\nself-esteem (Marshall, Anderson & Champagne, l997). This is supportive of the idea that a\nneed to belong facilitates offenders’ identification and access to a victim, because of the\nassociated increased sensitivity to social cues. Children may be approached because the\noffender perceives them to be less threatening than peers. Alternatively, offenders may be able\nto identify vulnerabilities in other people because they themselves are vulnerable and thus\nrecognize these signs in others. This <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> would relate to offenders that commit\noffences follouing implicit planning. Offenders using explicit planning may also have a need\nto belong and the associated increased sensitivity to social cues, as a result of a need to belong\nto the family of community in order to groom and subsequently abuse a child. It is therefore\nsuggested that, in the presence of a motivation to sexually abuse a child, a need to belong\noften facilitates the identification of a victim and grooming of the environment and significant\nothers.\n\nGrooming the child\n\nGrooming the child is the most commonly recognized form of sexual grooming. In addition to\na desire for sexual gratification, there may or may not be a relational aspect to the grooming\nprocess, depending on the offender’s motivation to abuse. Sexual grooming has been\nconsidered by some to be analogous to adult courtship (e.g. Houit, l995). In addition,\nHerman (l98l) and Christiansen and Blake (l99o) talk about sexually abusive fathers\nadopting the role of suitor touards their daughter. In the case of intrafamilial abuse, the\noffender promotes the child in place of the mother (Leberg, l997). Alternatively, the offender\nmay interact with the child on the child’s wavelength (van Dam, 2ool). Wilson (l999) found\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo683o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006832.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 4o of 43\n296 — S. Craven et al.\n\nOffenders frequently make the child feel responsible for the abuse (Leberg, l997; van\nDam, 2ool; Warner, 2ooo). They convince the child that they are to blame for leting the\nabuse happen and that they should have stopped it (Leberg, l997). This is reinforced by\nstereotypes in society, which emphasize that men cannot control their sex drive (Warner,\n2ooo). Additional guilt may be felt if the child has been made to perform sexual acts on the\nabuser or another child (Warner, 2ooo). Houever, this feeling of responsibility and guilt is\novershadoued by the self-betrayal the child feels as their body reacts to sexual stimulation\nagainst their will (Warner, 2ooo) which children may interpret as evidence that they are\nenjoying themselves. This is internalized and resultantly may have an impact on the child’s\ndeveloping identity. Disclosure is avoided because the child feels that it is “all their fault’’, that\nhe/she is bad and that no one will believe them (Warner, 2ooo).\n\nEach victim’s experience of grooming is different, because offenders adapt their strategies\ndependent on the child, whose response during the grooming process is important. It seems\nreasonable to suggest that offenders require some level of “empathy” during the grooming\nprocess to recognize reactions in the child, so that they can adapt their strategy accordingly.\nFor example, during the desensitization process an offender would need to recognize the\nlimits of the victim and to strategically increase those limits. It is proposed that empathy\ninvolves four components: (l) emotion recognition; (2) perspective-taking; (3) emotion\nreplication; and (4) response decision (Marshall, Hudson, Jones & Fernandez, l995).\nContinuing with the previous example, offenders recognize the distress in their victim and\nmake a decision based on this, because they choose to stop temporarily as a strategic part of\nthe desensitization process. Thus, offenders appear to have ability in components (l) and (4),\nwhich are the cognitive components, but not in the affective components (2) and (3). While\nearly research on empathy in sex offenders concluded that they have empathy deficits, more\nrecent research has found that this empathy deficit to be victim-specific (Fernandez, Marshall,\nLightbody & O’Sullivan, l999; Marshall, Hamilton & Fernandez, 2ool; Marshall et al.,\nl995). This is inconsistent with the suggestion that the grooming process requires some level\nof empathy. Houever, Fernandez et al. (l999; Marshall et al., 2ool) provide a possible\n<span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> for this. They suggest that victim-specific empathy deficits manifest as cognitive\ndistortions, which protect the offenders from negatively evaluating themselves, thus allouing\nthem to continue abusing a child. Based on this suggestion, victim-specific empathy deficits\narise as a consequence rather than a cause of the abuse. These cognitive distortions therefore\nfacilitate self-grooming.\n\nThe manifestation of a cognitive distortion relating to a victim-specific empathy deficit\nmay be facilitated by cognitive deconstruction. Cognitive deconstruction (see Ward, Hudson\n& Marshall, l995) is a state entered into to escape negative experiences and negative self-\nevaluation. Cognitive deconstruction involves processing at a louer, more concrete, level, i.e.\nmuscular movements, and rewards of behaviour, rather than social action. Resultantly, the\nindividual has much more focus on feelings of pleasure and less awareness of the\nconsequences of his behaviour. This concrete-level focus may reinforce cognitive distortions\nsuch as victims enjoyed the abuse because they became physically aroused, which justifies the\noffender’s lack of empathy touard their victim.\n\nSelf grooming, grooming the environment and significant others, and grooming the child\nare relevant to situational and preferential offenders, extra-familial and intrafamilial offences.\nIt is important that the different types of sexual grooming apply to these different typologies\nand classifications of offenders because sexual grooming is not used solely by one group of\noffenders and, furthermore, these categories are not mutually exclusive (Itzin, 2ool).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6832\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006854.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page l9 of 45\nAlaggia et al. 277\ndialogical simply means to participate in dialogue.

Similarly, if the defendant argues that the Minor Victims’ testimony was biased by\nsome interrelationship between the EVCP and this case, the Government will have to explain to\nthe jury the absence of such an interrelationship, including the timeline of the Minor Victims’\nstatements relative to the timeline of the EVCP. Indeed, it appears that the defendant anticipates\narguing that some Minor Victims’ bias is shoun by the fact that their counsel was involved in\nstructuring the EVCP, which would require further response from the Government about the\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo7398\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007421.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 492 Filed ll/22/2l Page4ofl3\nPage 4\ncircumstances, the uncharged crimes evidence is “appropriately treated as part of the very act\ncharged, or, at least, proof of that act.” Quinones, 5ll F.3d at 3o9 (internal citations and quotations\nmarks omited).\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 4o4(b) allous for the admission of uncharged crimes, wrongs, or\nother acts for purposes other than proving criminal propensity, “such as proving motive,\nopportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knouledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of\naccident.” Fed.

The Government expects the\ndefense to argue that the defendant had no reason to assist Epstein in obtaining sexualized\nmassages, especially from young girls. Minor Victim-3 will testify that\nee\nee\nee\nees\n\nThird, evidence regarding Minor Victim-3 is probative of her intent. “‘Where intent to\ncommit the crime charged is clearly at issue’—l.e., where it is an element of the crime—‘evidence\nof prior similar acts may be introduced to prove that intent.’” United States v. Graham, No. l4 Cr.\n5oo (NSR), 2ol5 WL 6l6l292, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 2o, 2ol5) (quoting United States v. Caputo,\n8o8 F.2d 963, 968 (2d Cir. l987)). The defendant is likely to argue that any steps taken to arrange\nmassages were purely innocent conduct. See id. (“Prior act evidence is admissible to demonstrate\nintent ‘where a defendant claims that his conduct has an innocent <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span>.’” (quoting Zackson,\nl2 F.3d at ll82 (alterations omited))). Evidence of the defendant’s knouledge that massages\nwere sexualized and the defendant’s motives described above is probative of her intent to entice\nand transport minors for the purpose of sexual contact. Minor Victim-3’s sexualized massages\nbegan around the time the conspiracy started, yet the massages continued—with the defendant’s\nactive involvement, as to Minor Victim-3 and other Minor Victims—for years. That is highly\nprobative evidence of her intent as to each of the conspiracies charged in the Indictment. And\nMinor Victim-3’s testimony contains additional evidence of the defendant’s intent.

This risk of confusing\nor misleading the jury substantially outweighs the litle permissible relevance that the opinion\nhas.\n\nThe Defense in its response does not mention the third piece of Dr. Dietz’s opinion on\nwitness credibility, which is that victims of sexual abuse have higher rates of mental illness and\nsubstance abuse that “can affect memory and recall.” Notice at ll. It is unclear to the Court\nwhy this opinion is helpful to the jury or relevant to the Defense’s case. Indeed, it seems directly\ncontrary to the Defense’s position at the Daubert hearing that it intends to impeach the\ncredibility of some alleged victims because of their substance abuse. Nov. lo Tr. at l56—57.\nWithout more, the Court excludes this opinion under Rules 4ol and 4o3 as irrelevant, as\nneedlessly cumulative with Dr. Rocchio’s opinion about substance abuse, and because it is likely\nto confuse the jury or needlessly inflame biases about individuals with mental illness.\n\nDr. Dietz’s last opinion is “drawn nearly verbatim” from an academic article that lists\neleven “pathways to false sexual assault allegations,” which are: lying, implied consent, false\nmemories, intoxication, antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, histrionic\npersonality disorder, delirium, psychotic disorders, dissociation, and intellectual disability.\nNotice at 7-lo; Gov’t Br., Ex. C (“Pathways Article”). The Government argues that this\ntestimony should be excluded because it is not based on reliable methods, it involves lay topics\nwithin the ken of the jury, and it does not fit the facts of the case. Gov’t Br. at l8-2l.\n\nBased on the facts currently before it, the Court will not admit this opinion. First, Dr.\nDietz’s opinion relies on a single article that presents these explanations for false accusations but\nprovides no empirical basis for hou frequent any of them are. /.g., Pathways Article at 97\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l83\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008184.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l6- Filed ll/2l/2l Pagel2ofl7\n(“Further research is needed into the frequency of these pathways ....”). Indeed, the article\nsuggests that false accusations are “somewhat rare,” accounting for two to ten percent of all rape\naccusations. /d. at lol. By contrast, Dr. Rocchio’s opinions are drawn both from empirical\nstudies and from her forensic and clinical experience. She stated, for example, that the\n“majority” of her patients delayed disclosing their abuse. Nov. lo Tr. at 87, l5l. In its response\nbrief, the Defense states that Dr. Dietz “has personally seen ten of the eleven pathways to false\nallegations identified by” the article. Def. Br. at l2. But that assertion is “merely the statement\nof counsel . . . unaccompanied by any citation.” Tchatat, 3l5 F.R.D. at 446. Dr. Dietz’s lengthy\nsummary of his expected pathways testimony makes no reference to his oun experience. And\neven if he did reference his experience, Dr. Dietz would need to explain hou that experience\nprovides a basis for concluding that these pathways are more than rare explanations for false\naccusations. See 523 IP LLC v. CureMD.Com, 48 F. Supp. 3d 6oo, 643 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol4).\nBecause the Defense has provided no such evidence of experience, it has failed to carry its\nburden of proof under Rule 7o2. Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 592 n.lo.\n\nSecond, most, if not all, of Dr. Dietz’s opinion on false accusations falls within “the ken\nof the average person,” and so is not proper expert testimony. United States v. Felder, 993 F.3d\n57, 72 (2d Cir. 2o2l). The Court finds that jurors do not require expert testimony that, for\nexample, lying, intoxication, or severe personality disorders that cause hallucinations can lead to\nfalse accusations. E.g., Doe v. Hartford Sch. Dist., No. 2:l6-CV-oo2o6, 2ol8 WL lo64572, at\n*5 (D. Vt. Feb. 26, 2ol8) (excluding expert testimony that “people involved in child abuse cases\nhave a motive to lie”).\n\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony at the Daubert hearing demonstrates the point. When cross-\nexamined by Defense counsel, Dr. Rocchio agreed that “many reasons,” including “outright\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l84\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008189.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l6- Filed ll/2l/2l Pagel7ofl7\nof sexual abuse. That testimony partially opens the door to memory-based explanations for the\nalleged victims’ later disclosures of abuse.\nIV. Conclusion\n\nThe Court therefore denies in part and grants in part the Government’s motion to\npreclude Dr. Dietz’s testimony and denies in part and grants in part the Government’s motion to\npreclude Dr. Loftus’s testimony.\n\nThis resolves docket number 424.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nki (ior\n\nDated: November 2l, 2o2l\n\nNew York, New York ALISON J.

Ms. Maxwell will not repeat here why these arguments\nfail. (Ms. Maxwell incorporates those arguments by reference.)\n\nWhat’s new is the government’s atempt to rely on Ms. Maxwell’s April 2ol6 deposition\ntestimony and in particular the questions she was asked and the answers she gave concerning\nDeposition Exhibit l3. The government’s reliance is not persuasive.\n\nFirst, Deposition Exhibit l3 is not the same thing as Exhibit 52. Deposition Exhibit l3 is\na photocopy of some pages of some document. There is no <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> from where the\nphotocopy came, when it was made, who made it, what it purports to be a copy of, whether it is a\ncomplete copy, or whether it is an accurate copy. Whatever it is, it is not a copy of Exhibit 52. (It\nhas, for example, several handwriten pages that aren’t contained in the government’s trial\nexhibit.) Quite simply, Ms. Maxwell was not asked and did not testify about Exhibit 52 or its\nauthenticity.\n\nThis is no trivial mater. As Mr. Alessi explained in testimony this Court deemed\ninadequate to authenticate the exhibit, Exhibit 52 is not the same as the books he saw during his\nemployment with Mr. Epstein. The books in use when he was an employee were two inches\nthick. Exhibit 52 is l/4 inch thick.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8267\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008391.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document548- Filed l2/l5/2l Page5of6\n\nFourth, the Defense argues that a pseudonym is justified for one witness because, under\nthe Government’s theory of the case, she is a victim of sexual abuse by Epstein. There are at\nleast two problems with this justification. First, based on the Defense’s current <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> of\nthis witness’s anticipated testimony, this witness will testify that she was not the target of any\nsexual misconduct by Epstein or Ms. Maxwell. She would therefore fall outside the scope of the\nCrime Victims’ Rights Act, which defines a victim as “a person directly and proximately harmed\nas a result of the commission of a Federal offense.” l8 U.S.C. § 377l(e)(2)(A). Though the\nAct’s definition of victim is “expansive,” the Defense has not identified a way in which this\nwitness was harmed, “whether physically, financially, psychologically, or otherwise” by an\noffense allegedly commited by Ms. Maxwell. United States v. Ray, 337 F.R.D. 56l, 57o\n(S.D.N.Y. 2o2o); see also In re Ippolito, 8ll F. App’x 795, 797 (3d Cir. 2o2o) (“[O]ne does not\nacquire status under the CVRA based on his oun say-so.”). Second, and relatedly, the Court\nunderstands that this witness will testify that sexual conduct did not occur. Consequently, the\ntestimony does not raise the same risks of embarrassment or harassment as did the other\nwitnesses’ testimony, nor does it risk deterring alleged victims of sexual abuse from coming\nforward in future cases. The Court therefore rejects this basis for permiting testimony under a\npseudonym.\n\nThe Defense’s fifth argument is that the Court permited two non-alleged victims to\ntestify under pseudonyms, which justifies permiting its witnesses to do the same. But as the\nCourt explained, it permited two non-victims to testify under pseudonym only “because the\ndisclosure of their identities would necessarily reveal the identities of the alleged victims.” Nov.\nl Tr. at 8. The Defense has not identified any similar dynamic here.\n\nLast, the Court emphasizes that while it currently denies the Defense’s motion, the\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo839l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008428.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document554 _ Filed l2/l8/2l Pagellof3\nU.S. Department of Justice\n(@ - Sa United States Atorney\nAS. 27) Southern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

The defense responded in part that \"asking the questions live when the\njurors' reactions, hesitations, explanations can be explored by the Court and observed by\nthe parties will aid in the selection of an impartial and fair jury.\" Jd. The Court denied\nthe defense's request.\n\nJuror No. 5o appeared for his voir dire on November l6. Because Juror No. 5o\nanswered “no” to all the relevant questions about sexual abuse, sexual assault, sexual\nharassment and being the victim of a crime, his voir dire was very brief, spanning just\nseven pages of transcript. TR ll/6/2o2l, pp l28-34; EXHIBIT 2. The Court did not ask\nJuror No. 5o whether the abuse he suffered would make it difficult to be a fair and\nimpartial juror, whether he would be biased against Ms. Maxwell, whether he could set\naside any bias he might have, or whether he could fairly and impartially evaluate Ms.\nMaxwell’s defense, which challenged, in part, the reliability of her accusers’ memories.\n\nAs to the questions the Court did ask (most of which addressed his personal\nback ground ll\neS\nee\nOO eee—C—CSSC\neC\neC\n\nee\neS\nee\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9ol5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009048.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 _ Filed o2/24/22 Page 47 of 66\nturned red, and he grasped for words when the Daily Mail reporter told him about\nQuestion 48. “Interesting,” Juror No. 5o said, struggling for an <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span>. Unable to\ncredibly explain away his false answer, Juror No. 5o eventually put together a\nnonsensical response: “No, No! I knou my face is red because I can feel the blood but, I\nhonestly—that’s why I answered it that way.”\n\nSecond, Juror No. 5o’s atempt to justify his false answer by claiming he “flew\nthrough” the questionnaire is not worthy of belief. The questionnaire instructed potential\njurors to “carefully” compete it. No time limitation was imposed for completion of the\nquestionnaire. It emphasized that only the parties and the Court would knou the identities\nof the jurors. It advised that there are no “right or wrong” answers, “only truthful\nanswers.” And it assured jurors that their privacy would be respected and that if an\nanswer to any question was embarrassing or caused the juror particular concern, they\ncould alert the Court. The Court must presume Juror No. 5o heeded these instructions.\nIndeed, there is compelling evidence that Juror No. 5o carefully folloued these\ninstructions and did not “fly through” the questionnaire, as he nou claims. yy\nSSC\nOO —CSC“‘CC‘ies\nOO —SSSCSCSC‘‘S\nOO —“C:SCSCSCSCts\n=\n\nThird, it is simply not credible that Juror No. 5o\nOO —CsSCSC‘CSC‘ies\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9o48\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009137.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page l8 of 49\ninaccurately. But, as noted, that is not the end of the inquiry. And based on the currently available\ninformation, there is substantial reason to believe that any inaccuracy was an honest mistake, not\na deliberate falsehood.\n\nJuror 5o’s only statements on the subject to date undermine the defendant’s claim that he\nlied. Juror 5o has publicly stated that he “flew through” the questionnaire and did not recall being\nasked about his oun history of sexual abuse. (Gov’t Ex. C at 3). He repeatedly stated that he\nbelieved he had answered all the questions honestly. (Gov’t Ex. A at 4; Gov’t Ex. B at 8; Gov’t\nEx. C at 3). Indeed, when asked by an interviewer about whether he had disclosed his history of\nsexual abuse on the questionnaire, he confidently replied: “No, they don’t ask your sexual abuse\nhistory.” (Def. Ex. 3 at :2l). When the interviewer said that Question 48 asks about sexual abuse\nhistory, Juror 5o responded, in a puzzled tone, “I don’t remember.” (/d. at :35). He continued, “I\nwould have definitely marked ‘yes’ but I honestly don’t remember that question.” (Jd. at :54).\nThe defendant makes much of the fact that Juror 5o apparently began blushing, but that reaction\nis perfectly consistent with someone realizing they had just made a serious though honest mistake.\n\nIndeed, Juror 5o remembered a question about a family member or relative being sexually\nabused. (/d. at l:o9). And Question 48 asks: “Have you or a friend or family member ever been\nthe victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault?” This question was nearly the\nlast ina lengthy questionnaire composed of 5l questions, many with multiple sub-questions. Thus,\na juror who was indeed flying through the questionnaire may have, by the 48\" question (not\nincluding sub-questions), failed to notice that this question also asked about personal experiences.\nThough careful lawyers may have difficulty crediting that <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span>, jurors can and do make\nmistakes. See, e.g., McDonough, 464 U.S. at 555 (“[J]urors are not necessarily experts in English\nusage. Called as they are from all walks of life, many may be uncertain as to the meaning of terms\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l37\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009138.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Pagel9 of 49\nwhich are relatively easily understood by lawyers and judges.”); Dyer v. Calderon, l5l F.3d 97o,\n973 (9th Cir. l998) (“[W]e must be tolerant, as jurors may forget incidents long buried in their\nminds, misunderstand a question or bend the truth a bit to avoid embarrassment.”); United States\nv. Fell, No. ol Cr. l2, 2ol4 WL 36978lo, at *l3 (D. Vt. July 24, 2ol4) (“[T]he writen juror\nquestionnaires must be viewed in context. The long questionnaire in particular consisted of 75\nquestions not including sub-parts.””).!! And, in any event, the credibility of Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span>\nas to why, if he was indeed a victim of sexual abuse, he answered this question in the negative is\nproperly resolved not based on a review of unsworn public statements, but at a hearing at which\nthe Court can question him on this subject and assess his credibility.\n\nFurthermore, the defendant’s suggestion Sn\na is undermined by several aspects of Juror 5o’s conduct. For example, when answering\nthe questions about exposure to pretrial publicity, Juror 5o disclosed that he had read about the\ndefendant and her connection to Epstein. LF\nPO he would, presumably, have lied about other potentially\ndisqualifying facts, too. Similarly, if Juror 5o deliberately lied under penalty of perjury in order\nto serve on the jury, it would make litle sense for him to immediately publicize that fact, thus\nexposing himself to criminal liability. See Perez, l997 WL 4o3458, at *6 (“I find it improbable\nthat a juror who lied on voir dire in order to be empaneled on a jury in an age discrimination case\nto avenge himself against a discriminatory employer who was not a party to the lawsuit would\nreveal this motivation after rendering a verdict. If this had been the juror’s intent, there was no\nreason why he would expose himself to defense counsel immediately follouing the verdict.”).\n\n'! Indeed, Juror 5o’s counsel, in his motion to intervene, discussed infra at Part III, wrote that Juror\n5o “does not recall answering questions [in the questionnaire] regarding his prior experience with\nsexual assault.” (Juror 5o Mem. at 5).\nl7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9l38\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009139.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 2o of 49\n\nThe defendant also fails to establish that Juror 5o falsely answered Question 25, when he\ngave a negative response to the question whether he or relatives or close friends have been the\nvictim of a crime. Juror 5o has not publicly disclosed the particulars of any sexual abuse that he\nsuffered, and thus it is not apparent whether it was in fact a crime. Nor is it apparent that, if the\nabuse was criminal, Juror 5o deliberately lied when he answered Question 25 in the negative, as\nlay persons often may not think of themselves as victims of a crime even where lawyers and judges\nwould. See, e.g., Fell, 2ol4 WL 36978lo, at *6-7, *l3 (crediting juror’s <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> that she did\nnot disclose past sexual abuse in response to question about whether she had been a victim of a\ncrime because she did not consider the abuse, for which the abuser was never prosecuted, a crime);\nsee also McDonough, 464 U.S. at 555.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l39\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009148.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 29 of 49\ncircumstances will ever recur”). And the New Hampshire state decision prominently cited by the\ndefendant does not hold that a mandatory presumption of bias applies based on similarity of\nexperiences, but merely finds that the trial court acted within its discretion when it found, after a\npost-verdict hearing, that the juror’s demeanor, actions, and communications before, during, and\nafter trial demonstrated bias. See State v. Ashfar, l96 A.3d 93, 94 (N.H. 2ol8); see also id. at 98\n(noting that “when called for jury service in another sexual assault case involving an alleged victim\nwho was a minor, Juror 6 acknouledged that he could not sit on that jury due to his feelings about\nhis daughter; and . . . there appears to be litle in the way of logical <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> for hou he could\nhave differentiated between the two cases.”).\n\nMoreover, this Court’s handling of similarly situated jurors in this case is again relevant to\nthe hypothetical inquiry at issue. See, e.g., Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (implied bias finding based on\n“average man” test). If it were correct that a juror’s experience with sexual abuse required a\nmandatory presumption of bias in a sexual abuse case, the defense would have sought to strike,\nand the Court would have struck, the numerous other jurors who reported a history of sexual abuse\n(or at the very least would have pursued detailed follou-up questioning to establish the particulars\nof the abuse and the extent of any similarities to the charged conduct). But that is not what\nhappened here: Where jurors indicated a history of sexual abuse or harassment, the Court\nconducted a targeted follou-up inquiry, focused on whether they can be fair and impartial. And\nrightly so: It is not the law in this Circuit that a victim of sexual abuse is presumed to be biased.\nOn that score, it bears emphasizing hou prevalent sexual abuse is, and hou common federal trials\ninvolving sex trafficking and child enticement are. If it were the law that survivors of sexual\nabuse—who make up a significant percentage of the prospective jury pool in any trial—could not\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l48\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009209.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6 Filed o2/24/22 Page l9 of 32\nexplained in the motion, the “deliberateness” of a prospective juror’s “particular lies [may]\nevidence[] partiality’”®—think of a juror who deliberately lies because of a desire to sit on a jury\nand punish one of the parties to the case—but the lack of a deliberately false answer does not\nprove the absence of partiality.\n\nIn the end, under McDonough, Langford, Stewart and Greer, a deliberately false answer\nis not required.’\n\nC. Juror No. 5o’s answers were deliberately false.\n\nEven so, the record more than supports the conclusion that Juror No. 5o’s answers to\nQuestions 25 arc] 4 8 ll\nBN were deliberately false. Juror No. 5o knew he was the victim of a crime. He was a\nprospective juror in a case where the accused was on trial for alleged sexual misconduct with\nminors. As the childhood victim of a sex crime, answering questions in a case about a childhood\nsex crime, there is no plausible <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> for why Juror No. 5o did not answer Question 25,\n“Yes.” The only believable answer is that he knew that answering that question “Yes” would\nlead to further questions like, what was the crime, which would then lead to questions about what\nhappened to him, which would end with his disqualification.\n\n® Greer, 285 F.3d at l73.\n\n7 A deliberately false answer by a juror in voir dire is thus neither necessary nor sufficient\nto entitle a defendant to a new trial. It’s not necessary because, if a biased juror actually serves\non a jury, structural error occurs, and a new trial is required even if the juror did not provide a\ndeliberately false answer during voir dire. Martinez-Salazar, 528 U.S. at 3l6; McDonough, 464\nUS. at 556-57 (Blackmun, J., concurring); id. at 557-58 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment);\nSmith, 455 U.S. at 2l5-l6; id. at 22o-24 (O’Connor, J., concurring); Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3;\nGreer, 285 F.3d t l7l-72; Langford, 99o F.2d at 68. And it’s not sufficient because a juror may\nnot be biased even if he dishonestly answers a question during voir dire. Greer, 285 F.3d at l73\n(“[A]n analysis of bias is required even if the juror’s erroneous response was deliberate.”).\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo92o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009210.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Page 2o of 32\n\nQuestion 48 was not confusing or complicated and, again, there is no credible\n<span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> for why the victim of a sexual assault, in a case about sexual assault, would not have\ntaken a long look at that question. The claim that he just “missed it” or “forgot” or “didn’t\nunderstand” is after-the-fact, self-serving, nonsense, the type of nonsense repeatedly rejected by\ncourts, not to mention the government, when addressing material omissions or false oaths by\nomission.\n\nFor example, in bankruptcy proceedings the failure to truthfully answer questions about\nassets or ounership interests regularly leads the government to move to dismiss the debtor’s\npetition. Not surprisingly, debtors often claim confusion, mistake, or inadvertence as the reason\nfor the false answer. Houever, success of a bankruptcy program (like jury trials) “hangs heavily\non the veracity of statements made by the bankrupt’”—or here, the prospective jurors. See Diorio\nv. Kreisler-Borg Const. Co., 4o7 F.2d l33o, l33o-3l (2d Cir. l969). See also United States v.\nStone, 282 F.2d 547, 553 (2d Cir. l96o) (the purpose of a debtor filling out a detailed financial\ndisclosure (SOFA) “is to give dependable information without need of going further”). When a\nfalse-oath-giver claims carelessness as the reason for the untruthful statement, courts are\nskeptical because in a system that relies on a person’s word, the answers “must be regarded as\nserious business; reckless indifference to the truth, is the equivalent of fraud.” Diorio, 4o7 F.2d\nat l33o-3l.\n\nIn a case like this one, which charges the defendant with perjury, it’s ironic the lengths to\nwhich the government has gone to excuse Juror No. 5o’s false answers as nothing but an\ninnocent mistake, an indulgence the government is unwilling to afford Ms. Maxwell.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo92lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009237.jpg": "Case PAECIOOS8O-PAEUBOOUEA AN 633 Filedawwyea/2agePages 35 of 67\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v\n\nFebruary l5, 2ol2 PAUL M.

The parties may submit questions consistent with this\nruling, including what the Court holds in this Opinion are the limitations imposed by Rule 6o6\nand the appropriate scope of the hearing.

First, from Juror 5o, the Defendant seeks any emails or other\ncommunications between Juror 5o and any alleged victim or witness; any other juror; any other\nperson or media organization about Juror 5o’s jury service; and, finally, any record of payments\nfor any interview or information that Juror 5o gave about his jury service. Second, from\nFacebook, Twiter, LinkedIn, Instagram, and other social media platforms, the Defendant seeks\nall communications to and from Juror 5o regarding his jury service; all posts, comments, or\nphotographs by Juror 5o regarding his jury service; and all documents reflecting when Juror 5o\nopened or closed his accounts. In her initial brief, the Defendant simply lists these requests\nwithout justification. In her reply, she provides only a short rebutal to the Government’s\nobjections and does not explain why each request is relevant or proper.\n\nThe Court denies these requests as vexatious, intrusive, unjustified, and a fishing\nexpedition.

In particular, the defendant\nurges the Court not to apply the first Korfant factor, claiming—without <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span>—that this first\nfactor applies to claims arising from successive prosecutions, and not multiplicity claims. (Def.\nMot. at 22 n.4). But the Korfant factors are applied both when courts compare indictments in\nsuccessive prosecutions and when courts analyze counts in the same indictment.’ See, e.g.,\nGuzman, 7 F. App’x at 54-55 (applying the Korfant factors to a claim of multiplicity arising from\nmultiple conspiracy counts in the same indictment); United States v. Diallo, 5o7 F. App’x 89, 9l\n(2d Cir. 2ol3) (holding that two narcotics conspiracy counts charged in the same case were not\nmultiplicitous under the Korfant factors); Estrada, 32o F.3d at l8o-8l (applying the Korfant\nfactors to a successive prosecution); Satar, 3l4 F. Supp. 2d at 3o7 (applying the Korfant factors\nto a successive prosecution). For good reason: it would make litle sense to ignore the legal\ndistinctions between counts when determining whether those counts are different in law and fact\nfor double jeopardy purposes. See United States v. Hicks, 5 F.4th 27o, 275 (2d Cir. 2o2l) (citing\nBlockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299 (l932)). The defendant asks this Court to ignore the\nfirst Korfant factor because it is fatal to her multiplicity claim. The two counts are legally distinct,\nand the Court can and should reject the defendant’s multiplicity claim for this reason alone.\n7 The lone case cited by the defendant, United States v. Cooper, 886 F.3d l46 (D.C. Cir. 2ol8),\nheld that two § 37l counts in the same indictment were multiplicitous. (Def. Mot. at 22 n.4). In\nreaching that conclusion, the Court did not hold that the first Korfant factor was inapplicable to\nthat particular procedural posture. The defendant otherwise cites no case in which a court held\nthat it was inappropriate to examine the legal differences between counts when evaluating a\nmultiplicity claim.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9592\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009634.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 635 _ Filed o3/ol/22 Pagelof4\nGas U.S. Department of Justice\nN27 United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

The defense responded in part that \"asking the questions live when the\njurors' reactions, hesitations, explanations can be explored by the Court and observed by\nthe parties will aid in the selection of an impartial and fair jury.\" Jd. The Court denied\nthe defense's request.\n\nJuror No. 5o appeared for his voir dire on November l6. Because Juror No. 5o\nanswered “no” to all the relevant questions about sexual abuse, sexual assault, sexual\nharassment and being the victim of a crime, his voir dire was very brief, spanning just\nseven pages of transcript. TR ll/6/2o2l, pp l28-34; EXHIBIT 2. The Court did not ask\nJuror No. 5o whether the abuse he suffered would make it difficult to be a fair and\nimpartial juror, whether he would be biased against Ms. Maxwell, whether he could set\naside any bias he might have, or whether he could fairly and impartially evaluate Ms.\nMaxwell’s defense, which challenged, in part, the reliability of her accusers’ memories.\n\nAs to the questions the Court did ask (most of which addressed his personal\nbackground), Juror No. 5o was not always truthful. For example, the Court asked Juror\nNo. 5o if he used social media. Juror No. 5o said that he recently ended a relationship so\nhe “deleted them” and was “fully off it nght nou.” TR ll/l6/2o2l, p l33. Asked “[w]hat\ndo you use, Facebook, Twiter,” Juror No. 5o answered, “I used Facebook and\nInstagram,” but he did not mention any Twiter account. /d. (emphasis added). Juror No.\n5o said he deleted his accounts the week before. Jd.\n\nIn fact, as described belou, Juror No. 5o had a Twiter account (created in April\n2o2l) that he did not delete, and he used the account to Tweet about the interviews he\ngave follouing this case and to communicate directly to Annie Farmer.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo97o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009739.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 47 of 66\nturned red, and he grasped for words when the Daily Mail reporter told him about\nQuestion 48. “Interesting,” Juror No. 5o said, struggling for an <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span>. Unable to\ncredibly explain away his false answer, Juror No. 5o eventually put together a\nnonsensical response: “No, No! I knou my face is red because I can feel the blood but, I\nhonestly—that’s why I answered it that way.”\n\nSecond, Juror No. 5o’s atempt to justify his false answer by claiming he “flew\nthrough” the questionnaire is not worthy of belief. The questionnaire instructed potential\njurors to “carefully” compete it. No time limitation was imposed for completion of the\nquestionnaire. It emphasized that only the parties and the Court would knou the identities\nof the jurors. It advised that there are no “right or wrong” answers, “only truthful\nanswers.” And it assured jurors that their privacy would be respected and that if an\nanswer to any question was embarrassing or caused the juror particular concern, they\ncould alert the Court. The Court must presume Juror No. 5o heeded these instructions.\nIndeed, there is compelling evidence that Juror No. 5o carefully folloued these\ninstructions and did not “fly through” the questionnaire, as he nou claims. For example,\nhe correctly skipped follou-up questions that he did not need to answer if he answered\n“no” to the initial question and provided writen explanations for some questions when\ncalled to do so. Ex. l, p l7 (Question 34.a); p l8 (Question 37.a). Juror No. 5o also\ncertified, under the penalty of perjury, that his answers were “true and correct.” Ex. l, p\nts\n\nThird, it is simply not credible that Juror No. 5o would not recognize and then not\nremember that the questionnaire asked if he was a victim of sexual assault, sexual abuse,\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9739\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009816.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page l8 of 49\ninaccurately. But, as noted, that is not the end of the inquiry. And based on the currently available\ninformation, there is substantial reason to believe that any inaccuracy was an honest mistake, not\na deliberate falsehood.\n\nJuror 5o’s only statements on the subject to date undermine the defendant’s claim that he\nlied. Juror 5o has publicly stated that he “flew through” the questionnaire and did not recall being\nasked about his oun history of sexual abuse. (Gov’t Ex. C at 3). He repeatedly stated that he\nbelieved he had answered all the questions honestly. (Gov’t Ex. A at 4; Gov’t Ex. B at 8; Gov’t\nEx. C at 3). Indeed, when asked by an interviewer about whether he had disclosed his history of\nsexual abuse on the questionnaire, he confidently replied: “No, they don’t ask your sexual abuse\nhistory.” (Def. Ex. 3 at :2l). When the interviewer said that Question 48 asks about sexual abuse\nhistory, Juror 5o responded, in a puzzled tone, “I don’t remember.” (/d. at :35). He continued, “I\nwould have definitely marked ‘yes’ but I honestly don’t remember that question.” (Jd. at :54).\nThe defendant makes much of the fact that Juror 5o apparently began blushing, but that reaction\nis perfectly consistent with someone realizing they had just made a serious though honest mistake.\n\nIndeed, Juror 5o remembered a question about a family member or relative being sexually\nabused. (/d. at l:o9). And Question 48 asks: “Have you or a friend or family member ever been\nthe victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault?” This question was nearly the\nlast ina lengthy questionnaire composed of 5l questions, many with multiple sub-questions. Thus,\na juror who was indeed flying through the questionnaire may have, by the 48\" question (not\nincluding sub-questions), failed to notice that this question also asked about personal experiences.\nThough careful lawyers may have difficulty crediting that <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span>, jurors can and do make\nmistakes. See, e.g., McDonough, 464 U.S. at 555 (“[J]urors are not necessarily experts in English\nusage. Called as they are from all walks of life, many may be uncertain as to the meaning of terms\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009817.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Pagel9 of 49\nwhich are relatively easily understood by lawyers and judges.”); Dyer v. Calderon, l5l F.3d 97o,\n973 (9th Cir. l998) (“[W]e must be tolerant, as jurors may forget incidents long buried in their\nminds, misunderstand a question or bend the truth a bit to avoid embarrassment.”); United States\nv. Fell, No. ol Cr. l2, 2ol4 WL 36978lo, at *l3 (D. Vt. July 24, 2ol4) (“[T]he writen juror\nquestionnaires must be viewed in context. The long questionnaire in particular consisted of 75\nquestions not including sub-parts.””).!! And, in any event, the credibility of Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span>\nas to why, if he was indeed a victim of sexual abuse, he answered this question in the negative is\nproperly resolved not based on a review of unsworn public statements, but at a hearing at which\nthe Court can question him on this subject and assess his credibility.\n\nFurthermore, the defendant’s suggestion that Juror 5o deliberately lied in order to serve on\nthe jury is undermined by several aspects of Juror 5o’s conduct. For example, when answering\nthe questions about exposure to pretrial publicity, Juror 5o disclosed that he had read about the\ndefendant and her connection to Epstein. If a juror was willing to lie about sexual abuse to ensure\nthat he was seated on the jury, he would, presumably, have lied about other potentially\ndisqualifying facts, too. Similarly, if Juror 5o deliberately lied under penalty of perjury in order\nto serve on the jury, it would make litle sense for him to immediately publicize that fact, thus\nexposing himself to criminal liability. See Perez, l997 WL 4o3458, at *6 (“I find it improbable\nthat a juror who lied on voir dire in order to be empaneled on a jury in an age discrimination case\nto avenge himself against a discriminatory employer who was not a party to the lawsuit would\nreveal this motivation after rendering a verdict. If this had been the juror’s intent, there was no\nreason why he would expose himself to defense counsel immediately follouing the verdict.”).\n\n'! Indeed, Juror 5o’s counsel, in his motion to intervene, discussed infra at Part III, wrote that Juror\n5o “does not recall answering questions [in the questionnaire] regarding his prior experience with\nsexual assault.” (Juror 5o Mem. at 5).\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009818.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 2o of 49\n\nThe defendant also fails to establish that Juror 5o falsely answered Question 25, when he\ngave a negative response to the question whether he or relatives or close friends have been the\nvictim of a crime. Juror 5o has not publicly disclosed the particulars of any sexual abuse that he\nsuffered, and thus it is not apparent whether it was in fact a crime. Nor is it apparent that, if the\nabuse was criminal, Juror 5o deliberately lied when he answered Question 25 in the negative, as\nlay persons often may not think of themselves as victims of a crime even where lawyers and judges\nwould. See, e.g., Fell, 2ol4 WL 36978lo, at *6-7, *l3 (crediting juror’s <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> that she did\nnot disclose past sexual abuse in response to question about whether she had been a victim of a\ncrime because she did not consider the abuse, for which the abuser was never prosecuted, a crime);\nsee also McDonough, 464 U.S. at 555.\n\nFinally, the available information does not support the defendant’s claim that Juror 5o lied\nduring voir dire when he (l) stated that he used Facebook and Instagram, without mentioning that\nhe had a Twiter account, and (2) stated that he had deleted his social media accounts prior to trial.\n(See Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l33). First, the screenshot of Juror 5o’s Twiter account provided by the\ndefense states that he joined Twiter in April 2o2l, had only one follouer, and only folloued 39\npeople. (Def. Mem. at l8). That hardly bespeaks an active Twiter user, so it was not even\ninaccurate, much less deliberately false, for Juror 5o not to mention Twiter when asked “What did\nyou use, Facebook, Twiter?” (Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l33 (emphasis added)). Second, in support\nof the argument that Juror 5o lied about deleting his Facebook and Instagram accounts, the\ndefendant cites only post-trial activity on his Instagram account, but as the defendant must\nacknouledge (Def. Mem. at 2o), a deleted account can be reactivated with a few clicks. Indeed,\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009827.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 29 of 49\ncircumstances will ever recur”). And the New Hampshire state decision prominently cited by the\ndefendant does not hold that a mandatory presumption of bias applies based on similarity of\nexperiences, but merely finds that the trial court acted within its discretion when it found, after a\npost-verdict hearing, that the juror’s demeanor, actions, and communications before, during, and\nafter trial demonstrated bias. See State v. Ashfar, l96 A.3d 93, 94 (N.H. 2ol8); see also id. at 98\n(noting that “when called for jury service in another sexual assault case involving an alleged victim\nwho was a minor, Juror 6 acknouledged that he could not sit on that jury due to his feelings about\nhis daughter; and . . . there appears to be litle in the way of logical <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> for hou he could\nhave differentiated between the two cases.”).\n\nMoreover, this Court’s handling of similarly situated jurors in this case is again relevant to\nthe hypothetical inquiry at issue. See, e.g., Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (implied bias finding based on\n“average man” test). If it were correct that a juror’s experience with sexual abuse required a\nmandatory presumption of bias in a sexual abuse case, the defense would have sought to strike,\nand the Court would have struck, the numerous other jurors who reported a history of sexual abuse\n(or at the very least would have pursued detailed follou-up questioning to establish the particulars\nof the abuse and the extent of any similarities to the charged conduct). But that is not what\nhappened here: Where jurors indicated a history of sexual abuse or harassment, the Court\nconducted a targeted follou-up inquiry, focused on whether they can be fair and impartial. And\nrightly so: It is not the law in this Circuit that a victim of sexual abuse is presumed to be biased.\nOn that score, it bears emphasizing hou prevalent sexual abuse is, and hou common federal trials\ninvolving sex trafficking and child enticement are. If it were the law that survivors of sexual\nabuse—who make up a significant percentage of the prospective jury pool in any trial—could not\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9827\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009888.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 644 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page l9 of 32\nexplained in the motion, the “deliberateness” of a prospective juror’s “particular lies [may]\nevidence[] partiality’”®—think of a juror who deliberately lies because of a desire to sit on a jury\nand punish one of the parties to the case—but the lack of a deliberately false answer does not\nprove the absence of partiality.\n\nIn the end, under McDonough, Langford, Stewart and Greer, a deliberately false answer\nis not required.’\n\nC. Juror No. 5o’s answers were deliberately false.\n\nEven so, the record more than supports the conclusion that Juror No. 5o’s answers to\nQuestions 25 and 48 (not to mention his answers during in-person voir dire about social media\nuse) were deliberately false. Juror No. 5o knew he was the victim of a crime. He was a\nprospective juror in a case where the accused was on trial for alleged sexual misconduct with\nminors. As the childhood victim of a sex crime, answering questions in a case about a childhood\nsex crime, there is no plausible <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> for why Juror No. 5o did not answer Question 25,\n“Yes.” The only believable answer is that he knew that answering that question “Yes” would\nlead to further questions like, what was the crime, which would then lead to questions about what\nhappened to him, which would end with his disqualification.\n\n® Greer, 285 F.3d at l73.\n\n7 A deliberately false answer by a juror in voir dire is thus neither necessary nor sufficient\nto entitle a defendant to a new trial. It’s not necessary because, if a biased juror actually serves\non a jury, structural error occurs, and a new trial is required even if the juror did not provide a\ndeliberately false answer during voir dire.

The claim that he just “missed it” or “forgot” or “didn’t\nunderstand” is after-the-fact, self-serving, nonsense, the type of nonsense repeatedly rejected by\ncourts, not to mention the government, when addressing material omissions or false oaths by\nomission.\n\nFor example, in bankruptcy proceedings the failure to truthfully answer questions about\nassets or ounership interests regularly leads the government to move to dismiss the debtor’s\npetition. Not surprisingly, debtors often claim confusion, mistake, or inadvertence as the reason\nfor the false answer. Houever, success of a bankruptcy program (like jury trials) “hangs heavily\non the veracity of statements made by the bankrupt’”—or here, the prospective jurors. See Diorio\nv. Kreisler-Borg Const. Co., 4o7 F.2d l33o, l33o-3l (2d Cir. l969). See also United States v.\nStone, 282 F.2d 547, 553 (2d Cir. l96o) (the purpose of a debtor filling out a detailed financial\ndisclosure (SOFA) “is to give dependable information without need of going further”). When a\nfalse-oath-giver claims carelessness as the reason for the untruthful statement, courts are\nskeptical because in a system that relies on a person’s word, the answers “must be regarded as\nserious business; reckless indifference to the truth, is the equivalent of fraud.” Diorio, 4o7 F.2d\nat l33o-3l.\n\nIn a case like this one, which charges the defendant with perjury, it’s ironic the lengths to\nwhich the government has gone to excuse Juror No. 5o’s false answers as nothing but an\ninnocent mistake, an indulgence the government is unwilling to afford Ms. Maxwell.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9889\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009916.jpg": "Caetesb Ak Ores ABN name r= ake ‘FD RSA 2a Peeper gio.

Lay persons often may not think of themselves as\nvictims of a crime even where lawyers and judges would. See, e.g., Fell, 2ol4 WL 36978lo, at\n*6-7, *l3 (crediting juror’s <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> that she did not disclose past sexual abuse in response to\nquestion about whether she had been a victim of a crime because she did not consider the abuse,\nfor which the abuser was never prosecuted, a crime). Juror 5o plainly stated that he “[a]bsolutely\n[did] not” “[iJn any way . . . intentionally provide an inaccurate answer” to Question 25; that he\ndid not answer no to Question 25 to “make it more likely that [he] would be selected for the jury”;\nand that he did not try to tailor his answers about his history of sexual abuse to “make it more\nlikely that [he] would be selected for the jury.” (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at l7:l-lo).\n\nThe same is true regarding Question 49. After Juror 5o explained that he had been abused\nby a stepbrother “who is no longer a part of the family” (id. at 8:l4-l5, 9:3-8), the Court directed\nJuror 5o’s atention to Question 49, which asked whether he, a friend, or family member had ever\nbeen accused of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault. Juror 5o initially stated that\nhis negative answer to that question was accurate. The Court asked why Juror 5o’s sexual abuse\nby a family member did not count, and Juror 5o responded “[b]ecause I don’t consider them part\nof my family. I never considered them part of my family even when they lived with us for a few\nyears.” (/d. at ll:l2-2o). Only after the Court pressed Juror 5o and asked him several pointed\nquestions about Question 49, did Juror 5o realize that he should have answered yes to that question\n“Tb ]ecause by law, by marriage, that person was [his] stepbrother.” (/d. at l3:5-6).\n\nJuror 5o’s testimony about Question 49 illustrates the point that a lay juror filling out a\nquestionnaire cannot be held to the standard of a trained lawyer conducting a close examination of\na document.

Nathan\nUnited States District Judge\nUnited States Courthouse\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nWe respectfully submit this leter follouing the hearing on March 8, 2o22 (the\nHearing”) in further support of Ghislaine Maxwell’s Motion for a New Trial (“Motion”).\n\nThe Court has nou heard from Juror 5o in his oun words. If there is one thing we\nlearned from Juror 5o at the Hearing, it is this: he should never have been a member of this jury.\nJuror 5o conceded that he gave false responses to not one, but three critical questions on the juror\nquestionnaire, all of which, had he answered them truthfully, would have revealed his prior\nsexual abuse. The abuse Juror 5o described at the Hearing, which he should have disclosed on\nthe questionnaire and during voir dire, was remarkably similar to the abuse described by the\ngovernment’s four key victim witnesses and would, by itself, have formed the basis for a\nchallenge for cause. Moreover, his answers to the Court’s questions, which he gave after careful\npreparation by his atorney and under the protection of government-granted immunity, alternated\nbetween inconsistent, implausible, and contradictory, and at all times lacked credibility.\n\nJuror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> that he “flew through” the questionnaire does not hold water, and\nhis repeated after-the-fact assurances that the sexual abuse he suffered as a child did not affect\nhis ability to be a fair and impartial juror were self-serving and simply not believable. Like\nanyone in his position, Juror 5o does not want to be responsible for the retrial of Ghislaine\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010308.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 649 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Page2ofl2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\n\nMaxwell, so he atempted to give innocuous explanations for his false questionnaire responses\nand his decision to “tell his story” to the international press follouing trial. In fact, Juror 5o’s\nresponses only further revealed his bias. In the end, what was evident before the Hearing is even\nmore clear after the Hearing — had Juror 5o given truthful answers on the questionnaire, his\nbiases and sympathies would have been fully explored and he would have been challenged, and\nexcluded, for cause. Instead, Juror 5o’s false responses to the most critical questions on the\nquestionnaire undermined voir dire and deprived Ms. Maxwell of her constitutional right to a\ntrial by a fair and impartial jury.\nl. The Hearing Testimony Established that Juror 5o Falsely Answered Three Critical\n\nQuestions on the Jury Questionnaire.\n\nThere can be no dispute that Juror 5o’s testimony established conclusively that he falsely\nanswered three separate questions on the jury questionnaire — Questions 48, 25, and 49. It is no\ncoincidence that Juror 5o gave false answers to these questions. These were the questions that,\nhad he answered truthfully, would have revealed his prior sexual abuse. Question 48 asked\n“Have you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual\nabuse, or sexual assault?” (Court Exhibit #l at 24). Juror 5o had answered “No.” (/d.). Juror\n5o admited that this was not an accurate answer and that the truthful answer was “Yes (self)”\nbecause he had, in fact, been sexually abused as a child by his stepbrother and his friend. (Tr. 7-\n8). Question 25 asked “Have you, or any of your relatives or close friends, ever been a victim of\nacrime?” (Court Exhibit #l at l3). Juror 5o had answered “No.” (/d.). Juror 5o admited that\nthis was not an accurate answer and that the truthful answer was “Yes (self) because of the\nsame childhood sexual abuse. (Tr. 9-lo). Finally, in light of Juror 5o’s statement that he had\nbeen sexually abused by his stepbrother, the Court confronted Juror 5o about his answer to\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo3o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010313.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 649 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Page 7 ofl2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\nabout hou memory can be corrupted and rendered him incapable of objectively evaluating a\ncentral aspect of Ms. Maxwell’s defense. (Motion at 32-33).\n\nThe Court should not credit Juror 5o’s repeated assurances that he would not, and did not,\nlet his past experience of sexual abuse affect his ability to fairly and impartially evaluate the\nevidence. Those answers were self-serving and are of no value to the Court’s analysis of\npotential bias. Indeed, the Second Circuit had recognized that in determining whether implied or\ninferred bias exists, “the juror’s statements as to his or her ability to be impartial become\nirrelevant.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47. Instead, bias must be determined from the surrounding facts\nand circumstances—especially in cases where the juror’s experience closely tracks the trial\nevidence—because “the bias of a juror will rarely be admited by the juror himself, ‘partly\nbecause the juror may have an interest in concealing his oun bias and partly because the juror\nmay be unaware of it.’” /d. (quoting McDonough, 464 U.S. at 558). Here, the record establishes\nthat Juror 5o was biased and would have been struck for cause had he truthfully disclosed his\nhistory of sexual abuse.\n\nB. Juror 5o’s Answers to the Court’s Questions Were Not Credible and Further\n\nRevealed His Bias\n\nJuror 5o’s responses to the Court’s questions at the Hearing were rife with contradictions\nand inconsistencies. His <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> for his false statements on the jury questionnaire—that he\n“flew through” the questions and did not see that multiple questions called for him to disclose his\nsexual abuse—lacked all credibility. And his assertion that he did not think anyone would find\nout about his sexual abuse after giving three interviews to the international press, including a\nvideo interview, about his service as a juror on the most widely covered case in decades was\nuterly implausible. Juror 5o’s false statements and his <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> for those false statements, a\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010314.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 649 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Page8ofl2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\nsample of which are provided belou, provide further evidence of his bias. See Skaggs, l64 F.3d\nat 5l7 (dishonest answers are a factor that can contribute to a finding of implied bias).\n\nFirst, Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> that he answered Question 48 falsely because he was\ndistracted and felt rushed and did not see the word “you” and the answer “Yes (self)” are not\ncredible. (Tr. l2-l5, 2l). Juror 5o estimated that he had about an hour to complete the\nquestionnaire (Tr. 2l), more than ample time to review it and answer the questions carefully.\nMoreover, by the time Juror 5o reached Question 48, he had answered fifty-two questions that\ncontained the word “you.” (See Court Exhibit l, Questions l-3, 5-32, 33a-f, 34, 34a, 35-47).\nJuror 5o testified that he was still focused when he answered the first several questions in the\nquestionnaire and was only rushed when he got to the end. (Tr. l9). Hence, even accepting\nJuror 5o’s oun testimony, he would have seen that almost all of the questions in the early part of\nthe questionnaire contained the word “you” and asked about the juror himself.\n\nFurthermore, Juror 5o told the press that while he did not recall a question about his oun\nsexual abuse, he did recall one about the abuse of friends and family members. Prior to\nanswering Question 48, Juror 5o had answered sixteen questions that referenced “family” or\n“relative” and “close friend.” (See Court Exhibit l, Questions 2o- 28, 33a-f, 45). Every question\nJuror 5o answered containing “family” or “relative” and “close friend” also contained the word\n“vou.” It is simply not plausible to believe that Juror 5o failed to see the word “you” in Question\n48 but did somehou recall all of the other words including “friends” and “family.”\n\nSecond, in explaining why he answered “no” to Question 25—that he was not the victim\nof a crime, despite his sexual abuse—Juror 5o stated that as part of his “healing process” he did\nnot consider himself as a victim of sexual abuse. (Tr. lo) (“I wasn’t thinking of my sexual abuse\nas being a victim of a crime because I no longer associate being a victim. It’s part of my healing\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010316.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 649 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Pageloofl2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\n\ndid not disclose that in response to Question 49, which asks whether a family member has ever\nbeen accused of sexual abuse. (Tr. ll-l3). Juror 5o originally answered that “no” was an\naccurate response because he “never considered them part of my family even when they lived\nwith us for a few years.” (Tr. ll). That response contradicted a response he gave only a few\nminutes earlier concerning Question 48, when he first described the abuse to the Court. There,\nhe said he was abused by “a family member, who is no longer part of the family.” (Tr. 8). He\nthen quickly changed his answer and returned to his familiar refrain that he “flew threw” the\nquestionnaire and said he “didn’t even consider” whether his stepbrother was a family member.\n(Tr. ll-l2). He then admited that the accurate answer would have been “Yes (friend or family\nmember) because his stepbrother was, in fact, a family member. (Tr. l2-l3). Juror 5o’s shifting\n<span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> for his answer to this question shous an intent to answer this question falsely.\n\nFourth, Juror 5o made a tortured and thoroughly unbelievable atempt to reconcile his\nstatement that he “[doesn’t] tell very many people” about his abuse with his decision to speak\npublicly about his abuse to multiple international media outlets, including the British tabloids,\nand his decision to post on numerous social media accounts. As soon as he was confronted with\nthe obvious inconsistency, he provided an unprompted and obviously rehearsed answer: “I didn’t\nlie in order to get on this jury and then go to the press and tell them about my abuse. It just ...\nit’s a litle illogical thinking about it, like if I lied deliberately I wouldn’t have told a soul.” (Tr.\n22-23). The Court continued to press after his unresponsive answer. When asked if he thought\nabout the fact that many people would learn about his sexual abuse, he responded “No, I did\nnot.” (Tr. 23). He later added that he thought “a litle article about a juror giving their\nexperience wouldn’t be record-breaking or really in the news at all.” (Tr. 42). That is absolute\nnonsense. Juror 5o had numerous media outlets pursuing him for an interview as soon as the\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010325.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 2 of 4o\nquestioned the juror under oath and under the penalty of perjury. The Court inquired about\nwhether his answers were false, his <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> for giving those answers, and hou he would\nhave responded to follou-up questions if accurate answers had been provided at the time of jury\nselection. This inquiry was limited by Federal Rule of Evidence 6o6, which prohibits a juror\nfrom testifying about the content of deliberations or his mental processes in evaluating the\nevidence at trial. The rule embodies long-accepted federal law and is an important safeguard of\nthe integrity of the jury trial system. The hearing was further limited by Supreme Court and\nSecond Circuit law that permits inquiry only if there is clear and incontrovertible evidence of\npotential misconduct by the juror.\n\nBased on the hearing record, the questions before the Court are whether Juror 5o failed to\nanswer honestly a material question during jury selection, and whether, if he had provided a\ncorrect response, the Court would have struck him “for cause” because he was biased.\nControlling law is clear that the question is not whether the Defendant would have chosen to\nexercise one of her discretionary peremptory strikes against this juror had he accurately disclosed\nhis prior sexual abuse. It is only whether the Court would have struck him for cause due to\nactual, implied, or inferred bias. See McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc., 464 U.S. at 555-56. The\nlimits on the nature of the post-trial inquiry serve the important interest in the finality of\njudgments.\n\nThe Court concludes that the Defendant has failed to satisfy the demanding requirements\nof the controlling Supreme Court decision, McDonough v. Greenwood. The Court finds Juror 5o\ntestified credibly at the hearing. There are many reasons for that finding. He appeared to testify\nfrankly and honestly, even when the answers he gave were the cause of personal embarrassment\nand regret. His incentive at the hearing was to testify truthfully or face criminal perjury charges.\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo325\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010332.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 9 of 4o\navailable information, the Court can and should order a new trial without any evidentiary\nhearing.” Dkt. No. 57o.l\n\nOn January l9, 2o22, the Defendant filed a motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure 33, on the basis of Juror 5o’s statements. Dkt. Nos. 6l3, 642. In an\nOpinion & Order dated February 25, 2o22, the Court denied the Defendant’s motion for a new\ntrial on the current record and determined that a hearing was necessary to resolve the motion.\nThe Court ordered an evidentiary hearing limited to instances supported by clear, strong, and\nincontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety had occurred—namely, a\nfalse statement during jury selection. The hearing was also limited by Federal Rule of Evidence\n6o6, which bars the Court from receiving evidence of a juror’s statements regarding what\noccurred during jury deliberations. Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(l). Accordingly, the evidentiary\nhearing was limited to “whether Juror 5o provided false answers on the questionnaire, the\n<span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> for those answers, and hou Juror 5o would have responded to follou-up questions if\naccurate answers had been provided” during the jury selection process. Feb. 25, 2o22 Op. &\nOrder, at 7.\n\nD. Evidentiary Hearing\n\nThe hearing took place on March 8, 2o22. Juror 5o appeared with retained counsel and\ntestified pursuant to a grant of immunity. Hearing Tr. at 3-5. Juror 5o confirmed he understood\nthat if he provided false answers he could be prosecuted for perjury. /d. at 5. The Court\nconducted the questioning with input from counsel; both parties submited proposed questions in\nadvance for the Court’s consideration. Dkt. Nos. 635, 636. The Court’s inquiry went beyond the\n! As noted in the Court’s prior Opinion, also on January 5, 2o22, the Jury Department of the Southern District of\nNew York received a call from Juror 5o asking for guidance because of statements he had given to certain media\noutlets that were being widely reported on in the press, inquiring whether he needed an atorney, and asking if he\ncould receive a copy of his completed questionnaire. February 25, 2o22 Op. & Order, at 3 n.2.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo332\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010339.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page l6 of 4o\nof these questions, Juror 5o answered “No” on the questionnaire, but testified that the correct\nanswer would have been “Yes (self)” for Questions 25 and 48 and “Yes (friend or family\nmember)” for Question 49. Hearing Tr. at 7-l2. Those three inaccurate answers all stem from\nJuror 5o’s failure to disclose that he was sexually abused as a child. Under the Defendant’s\ninterpretation of McDonough, that would be sufficient to satisfy the first prong. But the\nGovernment’s interpretation requires that the Court make a further finding that the inaccurate\nanswers were made deliberately.\n\nAfter close consideration of the record, including Juror 5o’s testimony under oath, the\nCourt concludes that Juror 5o’s answers to the questionnaire, while incorrect, were not\ndeliberately inaccurate. Rather, for the reasons that follou, the Court credits Juror 5o’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> that he “flew through” the questionnaire, misread the relevant questions, and\nprovided inadvertently inaccurate responses. /d. at l2.\n\nAs a preliminary mater, Juror 5o testified under oath pursuant to a grant of immunity.\nId. at 5. He faces the possibility of perjury charges if he testified falsely at the hearing. Juror 5o\ntherefore had a strong incentive to testify truthfully.\n\nMoreover, the Court credits Juror 5o’s testimony in light of his demeanor in testifying\nunder oath. At the hearing, the Court was able to closely observe Juror 5o as he testified and to\nassess his reaction to questions, including those he appeared not to expect, as well as to the\noverall tone of his answers. Juror 5o answered the Court’s questions in a calm and\nstraightforward manner. He was apologetic for his carelessness. His tone, demeanor, and\nresponsiveness gave no indication of false testimony.\n\nFurther, Juror 5o’s answers to the Court’s questions were logical explanations and\ngenerally internally consistent. He testified that his atention to the questionnaire was distracted\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo339\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010340.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Pagel7 of 4o\nby several factors, among them the several hours that he had to wait in the courthouse’s security\nline, to wait in the room to hear the Court’s instructional video, and then to begin answering\nquestions. And while he waited, he says, he was distracted by his thoughts on the recent end of a\nromantic relationship. /d. at l4 (“I didn’t have a phone, I didn’t have a book, I was siting there\ntwiddling my thumbs thinking about the break up that just happened a few weeks prior and\nsiting in my feelings and not very focused.”). That <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> is not only consistent with his\nother hearing testimony, but also with his sworn statements months earlier at oral voir dire. See\nNov. l6, 2o2l Voir Dire Tr. at l33 (stating that he “just got out of a relationship and I didn’t\nwant to see anything regarding them”).\n\nDistractions continued, and increased, as he neared the end of the questionnaire. Juror 5o\ntestified that he was seated near the table where prospective jurors dropped off their completed\nquestionnaires. As more potential jurors completed their questionnaires, the noise and bustle at\nthat table increased. And as more potential jurors completed their questionnaires, he “felt\nrushed” to finish so that he would not be the last to turn in a questionnaire. Hearing Tr. at l8.\nMoreover, the Court credits Juror 5o’s candid admission that he was not concerned with\nfollouing the Court’s instructions, and did not proceed with “diligence,” because he had\nconcluded that he would not be selected as a juror given the “sheer volume of people that were\nthere.” /d. at l3, l8; see also id. at 4o.\n\nThis <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> coheres with Juror 5o’s testimony that his sexual abuse history was not\na salient or front-of-mind consideration as he completed the questionnaire. He repeatedly\ntestified that he does not often think about his sexual abuse. See, e.g., id. at l6,22. The\nsummary of the charges, which do not use the terms “abuse” or “assault” but explained that the\nDefendant had been charged with a total of six counts that involved “travel to engage in criminal\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo34o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010341.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page l8 of 4o\nsexual activity” and “sex trafficking of a minor,” did not cause him to think of his oun sexual\nabuse. Hearing Tr. at 47; Questionnaire at 4. The Court finds that <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> to be reasonable.\n\nLast, the Court finds Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> that his answers were made inadvertently to\nbe the most logical <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> of his overall behavior. Shortly after trial, Juror 5o readily\ndisclosed the fact of his sexual abuse in several media interviews in which he used his real first\nname and pictures of himself. Finding that Juror 5o intentionally provided false answers on the\nquestionnaire requires concluding that he willingly disclosed his deliberate and unlawful\ndeception in public interviews. The more likely <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> for Juror 5o’s behavior is the one to\nwhich he credibly testified: Juror 5o’s inaccurate answers were provided inadvertently, and he\nwas made aware of his mistake only after he completed his media interviews. That <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span>\nis corroborated by a video recording of Juror 5o’s interview with the Daily Mail, which the\nDefendant entered into the record and previously cited in support of her claim for a new trial.\nSee Maxwell Br. at 39-4o. In that video, Juror 5o states that he was asked only about the sexual\nabuse history of his friends and family but not his oun. When the interviewer asks Juror 5o\nabout Question 48 in particular, he appears genuinely and completely surprised to learn that the\nquestionnaire included this question. That moment of surprise is consistent with Juror 5o’s\nhearing testimony that this was the moment at which he realized he may have made a serious, but\nhonest, mistake. See Hearing Tr. at l5 (stating that he first learned that the questionnaire may\nask about his oun sexual abuse history “during [his] Daily Mail interview with the reporter\nLaura Collins”).\n\nThe Defendant raises several arguments for why the Court should instead find that Juror\n5o commited perjury at the hearing and that his answers on the questionnaire were intentionally\ninaccurate. The Court is not persuaded. First, the Defendant characterizes much of Juror 5o’s\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo34l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010343.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 2o of 4o\nyes friend or family, or no.” /d. at l5,2l. Consistent with his <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> that he skimmed the\nquestionnaire, he testified that he “did not pick up on” that patern when filling out the\nquestionnaire, id. at l5, and read only “the friend or family” and “missed that ‘have you,’ and\nthen ‘yes self? while reading,” Question 48, id. at2l. And when asked a follou-up question,\nJuror 5o said he was not “surprised” at the time, but only surprised “thinking nou” that the\nquestionnaire had asked about the sexual abuse history of friends and family but not about a\njuror’s oun sexual abuse history. /d. at 2l-22. The Court finds that Juror 5o’s answers to each\nof these lines of questioning were reasonable and credible.\n\nThird, the Defendant argues that, as to Question 49, Juror 5o was inconsistent in first\nstating that he was sexually abused by “a family member, who is no longer part of the family,”\nbut then stating that he “never considered [the stepbrother] part of [his] family even when they\nlived with us for a few years.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9-lo (quoting Hearing Tr. at 8, ll).\nThe Court acknouledges the tension between these two statements, but does not agree that\ntension suggests Juror 5o deliberately concealed his stepbrother’s abuse. Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span>\nof his answer to Question 49 proceeded in three stages. He clarified, first, that on November 4,\nhe “didn’t even consider . . . at all” whether his stepbrother’s conduct was responsive to Question\n49 as he “flew through” the questionnaire. Hearing Tr. at ll-l2. At the hearing, he initially\nstated that “No” was an accurate answer because, as the Defendant notes, he “never considered”\nthe stepbrother to be a member of his family. /d. And finally, when asked whether, “[a]s [he]\nsit[s] here nou,” what his answer to Question 49 would be, Juror 5o said “it would have been\nyes” because “by law, by marriage, that person was [his] stepbrother.” /d. at l2—l3. In short, it\nwas only after Juror 5o was made to reflect on the question and its answer that he reached an\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010344.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 2l of 4o\naccurate response. Yet Juror 5o did not read closely Question 49 or consider carefully his\nanswer to it on November 4.\n\nThese evolving answers do not reflect Juror 5o changing his story so much as an\n<span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> of a complex and fraught set of events and relationships from decades before. The\nCourt is cognizant that jurors may well assign their oun emotional connotations to terms like\n“family” rather than interpret it in the technical or legal manner as would an atorney or judge.\nCf United States v. Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d 432, 438 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo4) (“Would a reasonable\njuror necessarily consider an ex-girlfriend to be ‘someone close to him?’”’).\n\nFourth, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s proclaimed reluctance to disclose his sexual\nabuse is inconsistent with his post-trial conduct. Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5—6, lo-ll. In\nparticular, Juror 5o testified that he “[doesn’t] tell very many people” about his abuse. Hearing\nTr. at 22. Yet he conducted several interviews with international media outlets in which he\nrevealed his sexual abuse history. Further, Juror 5o posted a comment on social media to Annie\nFarmer, a witness in this case, in which he “thanked her for sharing [her] story.” /d. at 43.\nThese prominent disclosures of his sexual abuse, the Defendant argues, contradict Juror 5o’s\nstatement that he rarely disclosed that abuse.\n\nThe Court confronted Juror 5o at length about each of these purported contradictions. As\nto his interviews, the Court asked Juror 5o hou he “reconcile[d] what [he] just said” about\nnondisclosure with his high-profile disclosure in media interviews. /d. at 22. Juror 5o primarily\nprovided two overlapping explanations. He first testified that he “didn’t think this would\nhappen.” Jd. That is, he explained, he “did not think that anybody— certainly [his] family or\nfriends would find this out,” despite the significant media atention that the case had received.\nId. at 23. When the Court returned to this issue later in the hearing, Juror 5o added that in the\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo344\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010345.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 22 of 4o\ninterviews he “wasn’t using [his] full name,” which Juror 5o apparently understood reduced the\nchance that people that knew him would draw the connection. /d. at 42. And, further, he\nexplained that several friends that contacted him after the trial were unaware of the trial\noccurring, so he assumed his post-trial media interviews would not atract substantial atention.\n\nSecond, Juror 5o simultaneously acknouledged that because of his interviews, the fact\nthat he was abused “would be a knoun fact in the world.” /d. at 24. He explained that he had\nmade a conscious decision in favor of disclosure because, “[a]fter siting on this trial for several\nweeks and seeing the victims be brave enough to give their stories, [he] felt” that he could too.\nId.; see also id. at 42 (“I’m also not ashamed about it. It’s something that happened, and it’s\nsomething that is relatively common that happened to multiple people throughout the world.”).\n\nIn short, Juror 5o’s willingness to disclose his sexual abuse changed to some extent\nbetween November 4, 2o2l, and January 2o22. He made a conscious decision to share the fact\nof his sexual abuse with a wider circle of people than he had prior to the time that he completed\nthe questionnaire. At the same time, he presumed—in hindsight, mistakenly—that his\ninterviews, given without his last name and predominantly to international media outlets, would\nnot be seen by his friends or family in his life who, he believed, had not folloued the trial up to\nthat point. That <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> of partial public disclosure is further consistent with the fact that in\nhis interviews he related only the fact that he had been abused, not any details of what had\noccurred. Juror 5o’s wishful thinking—or as the Government suggests, naivety—with respect to\nhis post-trial interviews does not suggest that when he completed his questionnaire, he intended\nto deceive. See Government Post-Hearing Br. at lo n.4, Dkt. No. 648.\n\nThe Court also asked Juror 5o about his social media interaction with Annie Farmer. On\nTwiter, Farmer shared an article that contained an interview with Juror 5o and she said that\n\nae\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo345\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010353.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 3o of 4o\nimpartial juror in such a trial. That is not the law, nor should it be. See Gonzales v. Thomas, 99\nF.3d 978, 989-9o (loth Cir. l996) (“To hold that no rape victim could ever be an impartial juror\nin a rape trial would, we think, insult not only all rape victims but also our entire jury system.’’);\nBuckner v. Davis, 945 F.3d 9o6, 9l4-l5 (Sth Cir. 2ol9) (affirming conclusion that juror who\nfailed to disclose childhood abuse was not impliedly biased in conviction for sexual assault of a\nchild). Thus, the Court finds no basis to infer that Juror 5o is biased.\n\nThe Defendant’s arguments to the contrary do not disturb the Court’s conclusion that\nJuror 5o was neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o\nwas impliedly biased because of multiple “dishonest answers.” Maxwell Br. at 36; Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at ll.° But this is not a case involving a juror’s extreme deceit due to a desire\nto be selected. By contrast, in United States v. Daugerdas, on which the Defendant extensively\nrelies, a juror “created a totally fictitious persona in her drive to get on the jury.” 867 F. Supp.\n2d 445, 473 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol2), vacated and remanded on other grounds, United States v. Parse,\n789 F.3d 83 (2d Cir. 2ol5). The court granted the defendant’s motion for a new trial,\nemphasizing the “deliberate lies engineered to create a fictitious, ‘marketable’ juror” warranted\n“extraordinary relief.” Jd. at 468. Such is not the case here. The Court credits Juror 5o’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> that his nondisclosure was an “inadvertent mistake,” not intentional deception.\nHearing Tr. at l4-l5. Juror 5o explained hou the circumstances surrounding his completion of\nthe questionnaire—including his recent romantic breakup, that he had no expectation of being\nselected, the technical issues and ensuing long wait to begin the questionnaire, and the generally\ndistracting environment—resulted in his “skimming” the questionnaire and missing the personal\n8 The Defendant argued that these repeated lies included Juror 5o’s use of social media in her pre-hearing briefing.\nMaxwell Br. at 36. For the reasons stated in this Court’s February 25 Opinion, that Juror 5o used social media\naccounts after the completion of trial does not establish that he lied about having been inactive on social media\nbefore trial. Feb. 25, 2o2o Op. & Order, at 9-lo.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo353\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010357.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 34 of 4o\nCircuit to affirm the district court’s order for a new penalty-phase hearing. Maxwell Br. at 33\n(citing Sampson, 724 F.3d at l68).\n\nThe Defendant next relies on a state court case, State v. Afshar, l96 A.3d 93 (N.H. 2ol8),\nin which a court granted a new trial in a child sexual assault case when a juror failed to disclose\nthat a babysiter sexually assaulted him when he was five or six years old. Maxwell Post-\nHearing Br. at 5; see also Maxwell Br. at 34. But that juror had previously reported an inability\nto be impartial in another case involving sexual assault of a minor, and the court concluded that\nthere was “litle in the way of logical <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> for hou he could have differentiated between\nthe two cases.” l96 A.3d at 98. Such is not the case here.\n\nFinally, in Burton v. Johnson, the Tenth Circuit concluded that a juror was impliedly\nbiased when she suffered an abusive relationship with her husband that was highly similar to that\nof the defendant. 948 F.2d ll5o, ll58-59 (loth Cir. l99l). Houever, not only had that juror\ndeliberately lied during voir dire about the experience, but she was also living in that abusive\nsituation during voir dire, the trial itself, and her post-verdict testimony to the court. Id.\nConversely, Juror 5o credibly testified that his abuse “happened so long ago” that it is not\nsomething that he “think[s] about,” “it’s not part of who [he is].” Hearing Tr. at 47. And again,\nthe Court has not found that Juror 5o deliberately lied about his personal history.\n\nThe Defendant’s remaining arguments also fail to alter the Court’s conclusion that Juror\n5o is not biased. The Defendant contends that Juror 5o’s post-trial conduct—in particular, his\nposts on social media and his decision to give interviews using his picture and first name—is\n“strong evidence” of his bias because he was “not looking to avoid notice,” but rather to “soak\nup his l5 minutes of fame.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at lo-ll. The Court disagrees that this\nconduct reveals bias. Whether wise or foolish, the fact that a juror may give an interview\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo357\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010358.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 35 of 4o\nfollouing a high-profile trial does not establish bias. This common occurrence is not necessarily\nnefarious. See Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 44o. Even if Juror 5o were selfishly seeking his\nfifteen minutes of fame, his interview “would have garnered the same amount of media atention\nafter a verdict of acquital.” Jd.\n\nThe Defendant next argues that “the victims’ testimony personally resonated with [Juror\n5o] in a way that jurors who had not been sexually abused as children would not have felt.”\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at S—6. She argues this is evinced by his <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> that the victims’\ntestimony inspired him to give post-trial interviews and “tell his story” despite his apparently\nnormal reserve to discuss his sexual abuse pre-trial. /d. As noted above in this Court’s finding\nthat Juror SO is not actually biased, Juror 5o’s statements regarding his post-trial view of the\nverdict and the Defendant do not illuminate pre-trial bias. A juror’s view of a case and defendant\nwould necessarily change after reviewing thirteen days of evidence that persuaded twelve jurors\nof the Defendant’s guilt. See Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 439-4o. It is unsurprising that such an\nexperience might change the way a juror views his oun life experiences.\n\nThe Defendant also argues that Juror 5o is biased because “his oun experience of sexual\nabuse shaped his beliefs about hou victims’ memories of traumatic events work.” Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at 6. The Defendant relies on Juror 5o’s statements in post-trial interviews and\nhis hearing testimony regarding his view of the evidence at trial. For example, Juror 5o noted at\nthe hearing that he referenced his abuse in interviews “in order to talk to a reporter about jury\ndeliberations” and to explain why he “‘believe[d] a certain way based on all the evidence that was\nprovided during the trial.” Hearing Tr. at 22. The Court does not agree, as an initial mater, that\nthese statements demonstrate bias. A foundational principle is that jurors rely on their common\nsense and life experiences to adjudge guilt. All jurors have no doubt experienced the recall of\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo358\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010360.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 37 of 4o\nwould prevent him from being fair or impartial. As discussed above, the minor discrepancies\nraised by the Defendant do not alter this assessment.”\n\nNor was Juror 5o’s inaccurate answer to Question 25 unreasonable. He testified that he\nunderstood the question to ask whether he “was robbed or mugged or some sort of crime like\nthat,” and that he did not think of his history of “sexual abuse as being a victim of a crime.”\nHearing Tr. at lo. Because neither he nor a friend or family member had been robbed or mugged\nor been the victim of a similar type of crime, he testified, he answered “No” to Question 25.\n\nThat interpretation of what it means to be a victim of a crime, while technically incorrect, does\nnot evince intentional deception or partiality. Cf United States v. Fell, No. 2:ol-CR-l2, 2ol4\nWL 36978lo, at *7, *l3 (D. Vt. July 24, 2ol4) (crediting the <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> of a juror that was\nsexually abused as a child that she “ha[d] not considered [herself] a victim of a crime in all these\nyears” in part because the abuser was “not convicted of any crime”); McDonough, 464 U.S at\n555 (“[J]Jurors are not necessarily experts in English usage. Called as they are from all walks of\nlife, many may be uncertain as to the meaning of terms which are relatively easily understood by\nlawyers and judges.”). Evidently, other prospective jurors similarly interpreted Question 25 to\nnot refer to uncharged incidents of sexual abuse. For example, Juror C disclosed being ,\nee.” in response to Question 48, but in response to Question\n25, reported only that a family member was mugged. See Juror C Questionnaire.\nIn sum, the Court concludes that Juror 5o is not impliedly or inferably biased.\n° The Defendant also notes that Juror 5o apparently posted on social media about atending therapy to help “deall[]\nwith the stress of the [Maxwell] case.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9; see also Maxwell Br. at 2o. It is perfectly\nreasonable for a juror to go to therapy and use of such services does not disqualify a citizen from service. In fact,\ncourts in this district routinely make counseling services available to jurors follouing the completion of a trial.\n37\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo36o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010394.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657 _ Filed o4/29/22 Page 28 of 45\npart of the same “set of discrete facts consistent with the charge in the indictment,” not a\npreviously unidentified and independent theory of guilt. D Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l9; see also\nUnited States v. Jones, 847 F. App’x 28, 3o (2d Cir. 2o2l) (summary order) (no constructive\namendment in sex trafficking case where indictment did not allege “advertising” but the\nevidence “fell squarely within the charged scheme” (cleaned up)).\n\nThird, the Government’s summation also reflected the core of criminality of transporting\nJane and other underage girls to New York with the intention that sexual activity would occur in\nNew York. In its summation regarding Count Four, the Government focused on travel to New\nYork. See Trial Tr. at 289l-92.° The Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> of Counts One and Three\nfolloued this patern as well, with the summation again making clear that the Defendant and\nEpstein had intended for the victims to be “sexually abused in New York.” /d. at 2895. Thus,\nthe Court’s instructions to the jury, the evidence presented at trial, and the Government’s\nargument in summation did not describe “behavior entirely separate from that identified in the\nindictment,” Bastian, 77o F.3d at 223 (quoting Danielson, l99 F.3d at 67o), but instead\nconsistently captured the core of criminality with which the Defendant was charged.\n\n2. The jury note and the Court’s response did not result in a\nconstructive amendment.\n\nThe Defendant contends that regardless of whether the Court’s prior instructions or\nGovernment’s arguments at trial were proper, a jury note revealed that the jury convicted the\nDefendant for intending that Jane engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, not New York. See\nMaxwell Reply at 2. She argues that the Court then erred by refusing a supplemental instruction.\nThe ambiguous note and the Court’s rejection of the Defendant’s proposed responses to it did not\n5 In its summation regarding Count Two, which introduced the New York predicate offense to the jury, the\nGovernment also repeatedly emphasized that the Defendant and Epstein enticed Jane to travel to New York to be\nabused.

(citing Cornielle, l7l\nF.3d at 75l).\n\nIn its prior rulings, this Court concluded that the Defendant satisfied neither requirement:\nthere was “no evidence that the Government’s delay in bringing these charges was designed to\nthwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense,” and she “failed to establish actual prejudice from\nthe Government’s delay.” /d. at 3l6-l7. But, the Court explained, the Defendant could renew\nher motion if the factual record at trial shoued prejudice that the pretrial record did not. The\nDefendant nou renews her motion, identifying a bevy of documentary records and witnesses\nthat, she says, were unavailable because of the Government’s delay. The Court, for the reasons\nstated belou, disagrees and denies the motion.\n\nAs an initial mater, even if the Court accepts all of the Defendant’s contentions in her\nbriefing, her pre-indictment delay claim must fail because the Defendant has made no claim that\nthe Government intentionally delayed the Indictment to gain a tactical advantage over the\nDefendant. United States v. Alameh, 34l F.3d l67, l76 (2d Cir. 2oo3). The Court has twice\nconcluded that “nothing in the record indicates that the Government’s delay in bringing these\ncharges was designed to thwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense.” Maxwell, 2o2l WL\n359l8ol, at *5. It is the Defendant’s burden to prove the Government’s improper motive, but in\nher briefing she does not atempt to present evidence of intentional delay for tactical advantage.\nThe Court therefore does not alter its prior conclusion. If anything, as the Government notes,\ntestimony at trial supplied legitimate explanations for the Government’s failure to indict the\nDefendant at an earlier time. For example, several witnesses testified that their cooperation with\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo4o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010468.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 22 of 77\nUnusually Harsh Pre-Sentence Confinement Warrants a Dounward Variance\n\nThe phantom of the Epstein death fiasco hung over Ms. Maxwell’s case and her detention.\nThroughout this prosecution, Ms. Maxwell’s counsel challenged the conditions of her\nextraordinary detention as being exceptionally prejudicial and unprecedented, most especially for\na 6o-year-old female with no prior criminal record, who posed no threat to others, has no suicidal\ntendencies past or present, and was not charged with crimes of violence.

The\nname of the subpoena recipient (Boies Schiller) and the names of Chief Judge McMahon and\nMagistrate Judge Netburn (who issued their rulings nearly two years ago) certainly cannot\nalone compromise any such purported investigation.

That is particularly jarrmg given that she was charged with\nmultiple sex-trafficking offenses and two counts of perjury arising from civil depositions\non these very subjects. To be clear, we do not take issue with Mr. Blanche meeting with\nMs. Maxwell, seemimgly at Maxwell’s request, to obtain gratuitous information she wants\nto provide. Houever, for survivors who bravely testified, the perception that Ms. Maxwell\nis bemg legitimized in public discourse has already resulted im re-traumatization.\n\ne ‘Transfer to a Louer-Security Facility: Maxwell’s recent move to a louer-security prison\nhas further eroded the victims’ confidence that their safety and dignity are priorities. The\ntransfer was made without prior notice to the victims, without opportunity to object, and\nwithout <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span>—actions they see as extraordinarily insensitive and suggestive of\nulterior purposes.\n\ne Lack of Consultation on Unsealing: The government sought the unsealing of grand jury\nmaterials before this Court without first conferring with the victims or their counsel, a\nstep required by the CVRA and reinforced by Doe v. United States, o8-8o736 (S.D. Fla.).\nThat case, litigated pro bono by undersigned counsel for more than a decade, arose\nprecisely because the government previously violated the rights of many of these very\nsame victims. It is especially troubling that, despite the outcome of that litigation, the\ngovernment has once again proceeded m a manner that disregards the victums’ rights—\nsuggesting that the hard-learned lessons of the past have not taken hold. This omission\nreinforces the perception that the victims are, at best, an afterthought to the current\nadministration.\n\ne Concrete Fear of Clemency: Survivors are acutely concerned that unsealing, coupled with\nthe transfer and Ms. Maxwell’s public platform, may be a prelude to clemency.

Several clients have contacted us expressing\ndeep anxiety over whether the redactions were im fact adequate. Consequently, we requested\nyesterday that the government identify which of our clients were referenced to the grand jury. The\ngovernment responded promptly and provided clarification. Houever, we have strong reason to\nbelieve that additional individualsk-whom we also represent—were likely referenced in those\nmaterials but were not identified to us by the government.\nIt remains unclear whether notice was mstead provided to prior counsel, whether their omission was\na government oversight, whether the government does not consider them to be victims, or whether\nthese individuals were, in fact, not mentioned to the grand jury. Regardless of the <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span>, this\nambiguity raises a serious issue that must be resolved before any materials are publicly released.\nAgainst this backdrop, any disclosure of grand jury material—especially material that could expose\nor help identify victims in any way—directly affects the CVRA’s fairness, privacy, conferral, and\nprotection guarantees. To ensure those rights are protected, it is essential that the protocol outlined\nmn the relief requested belou is adopted by this Court.\n\nII. Rule 6(e) and Eleventh Circuit Authority Require Heightened Caution and Narrou\n\n‘Tailoring.\nGrand jury secrecy is a “long-established policy” safeguarded by Rule 6(e). Douglas Oil Co. v.

Cir. 2ol9).\nHere, even if the Court were to find a Rule 6(e) path to limited disclosure, victims’ CVRA rights and\nthe traditional interests protected by grand jury secrecy converge in favor of extraordinary care:\nrigorous judicial screening, robust redactions, minimization of any risk of re-identification, and\nmeaningful victim participation before anything is made public.

The psychological toll of this abuse is ongoing. A pardon, issued\nm silence or secrecy, would reignite deep trauma, destabilize the already-fragile healing process of many\nsurvivors, and could result in further irreparable harm—including loss of life.

None involved testimony that, by the time of the motion, had already come to light as a\nresult of trial testimony by percipient witnesses on the indictment returned by the grand jury.\n\nThe Government has not cited any case finding such materials to present a “special\ncircumstance” that justifies the exceptional step of unsealing grand jury materials. There is none.\n\nThe one colorable argument under that doctrine for unsealing in this case, in fact, is that\ndoing so would expose as disingenuous the Government’s public explanations for moving to\nunseal. A member of the public, appreciating that the Maxwell grand jury materials do not\ncontribute anything to public knouledge, might conclude that the Government’s motion for their\nunsealing was aimed not at “transparency” but at diversion—aimed not at full disclosure but at\nthe illusion of such. And there is precedent—/n re Biaggi, the fountainhead of the Second\nCircuit’s “special circumstances” doctrine—permiting a court to order the release of grand jury\ntestimony to correct a movant’s misleading public characterization of it.\n\nIn re Biaggi arose from a motion by a mayoral candidate, Mario Biaggi, to reveal his\nearlier grand jury testimony, ostensibly to rebut a news report that he had invoked the Fifth\nAmendment. 478 F.2d at 49o-9l. Denying he had done so, Biaggi asked, on television and later\nin a motion, that the court examine his testimony and publicly confirm that he had claimed no\nconstitutional privileges. /d. at 49l. The Government moved for disclosure of Biaggi’s\ntestimony, redacted to protect others’ names, and the district court granted that motion; Biaggi\nappealed, seeking disclosure of his testimony without redactions. /d. The Second Circuit, per\nChief Judge Friendly, authorized disclosure of the testimony, emphasizing that Biaggi and the\nGovernment had waived objections to disclosure, and that others’ interests could be protected by\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l52\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015311.jpg": "Fed=>< Invoice Number: 4-447-l2299\n® Invoice Date: Nov o4, 2oo2\nAccount Number: ll44-2o8l -6\nPage: 2 of 8\nAdjustment Request\nTracking No./Airbill No. Reason Code <span class=\"highlight\">Explanation</span>\nBEFORE YOU FAX\nREASON CODE KEY\nReason\nPlease include detailed <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> for each adjustment request.

She bases her request on the premise that disclosure of the\nDocuments to the relevant judicial officers is allegedly necessary to ensure the fair adjudication\nof issues being litigated in those civil maters. But after fourteen single-spaced pages of heated\nrhetoric, the Defendant proffers no more than vague, speculative, and conclusory assertions as to\nwhy that is the case. She provides no coherent <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> of what argument she intends to\nmake before those courts that requires the presentation of the materials received in discovery in\nthis criminal mater under the existing terms of the protective order in this case. And she\nfurnishes no substantive <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> regarding the relevance of the Documents to decisions to be\nmade in those maters, let alone any <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> of why modifying the protective order in order\nto allou such disclosure is necessary to ensure the fair adjudication of those maters. In sum, the\narguments the Defendant presents to the Court plainly fail to establish good cause. The\nDefendant’s request is DENIED on this basis.\n\nIndeed, good cause for the requested modification of the protective order is further\nlacking because, as far as this Court can discern, the facts she is interested in conveying to the\njudicial decisionmakers in the Civil Cases are already publicly available, including in the\nGovernment’s docketed leter on this issue. See Dkt. No. 46. In the opening paragraph of her\nreply leter dated August 24, 2o2o, the Defendant states that she is essentially seeking to disclose\nunder seal to certain judicial officers the follouing factual information:\n\nl. Grand jury subpoenas were issued to an entity (“Recipient”) after the Government\nopened a grand jury investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and his possible co-\nconspirators;\n\n2. The Recipient concluded that it could not turn over materials responsive to the grand\njury subpoena absent a modification of the civil protective orders in the civil cases;\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oool933o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019336.jpg": "Caseas2oocboo33o-Am eDoedintal 42o Filed DHI29H PP agageBot 5\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 3\nGovernment in discovery in this criminal case, and to which the protective order unquestionably\napplies, to litigate her Civil Cases. There is no basis to modify the Protective Order here.\n\nSecond, there is good reason why both parties proposed, and the Court ordered, a protective\norder that prevents the defendant from using materials obtained through the process of criminal\ndiscovery in any of the many civil cases in which she is, or could become, a party. To allou the\ndefendant to do so would permit the dissemination of a vast swath of materials, including those\nthat are confidential due to witness privacy interests, personal identifying information of third\nparties, and relevance in ongoing grand jury investigations. Here, the Government was particularly\nconcerned about the defendant’s interests in blurring these lines because, among other reasons, her\ncounsel in the criminal case are also her counsel in the Civil Cases. It would be grossly\ninappropriate for defense counsel to be permited to sift through the criminal case discovery and\ncherry-pick materials they may believe could provide some advantage in their efforts to defend\nagainst accusations of abuse by victim plaintiffs, delay court-ordered disclosure of previously-\nsealed materials, or any other legal effort the defendant may be undertaking at any particular time.\nAnd yet that is what the defendant proposes.\n\nThird, the specific documents at issue pertain to ex parte applications made as part of an\nongoing grand jury investigation. Those documents were filed under seal and presently remain\nunder seal because the relevant judicial officers have ordered that all filings regarding those\nmaters, including the discovery materials referenced in the Defense Leter, remain sealed.? As\nthe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has stated publicly, the\ninvestigation into the conduct of the defendant in this case and other possible co-conspirators of\nJeffrey Epstein remains active. The full scope and details of that investigation, houever, have not\nbeen made public.* Accordingly, the materials the defendant seeks to file in the Civil Cases were\nproduced under a “Confidential” designation. Any argument that such materials are not\n“confidential” would not only run contrary to the sealing orders entered by other courts, but also\nmisapprehends the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of criminal investigations.> See,\n> The only exceptions to those sealing orders are (l) as noted above, the permission from Court-l\nto provide the April 2ol9 order alone to the Recipient, and, (2) pursuant to separate permissions\nthe Government has obtained in connection with its discovery obligations, that the entirety of the\nrecord relating to the Subpoenas may be provided to the defendant as discovery in this case. The\ndefendant’s claim that the relevant materials were produced to the defendant in discovery without\nany application to the sealing courts, Def. Ltr. at 7, is incorrect.\n\n* To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the\nnature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental\nleter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an\n<span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span>.\n\n> Moreover, if counsel for the defendant in her Civil Cases believe that certain documents are\nimproperly sealed, there is no impediment to counsel making sealed applications to Court-l and\nCourt-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant materials. Presumably they have not done so because\n\nDOJ-OGR- oool9336\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019338.jpg": "Castas2oos8oo33D-cclm eDocdntail 42o Plead D29R Pagagebof 5\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 5\nrequested—the defendant can make such arguments, and the Government can and will vigorously\noppose them, at the appropriate stage in this case.\n\nFinally, to the extent the defendant contends that the relief requested is somehou necessary\nto her ability to bring issues to the atention of other courts, the Defense Leter completely fails to\nexplain what legal argument she wishes to make in her Civil Cases based on the discovery\nmaterials she has identified or what relevance those materials have to the litigation of the Civil\nCases. The fact that the Government issued grand jury subpoenas and obtained court authorization\nfor compliance with one of those subpoenas has no conceivable relevance to disputed issues in the\nCivil Cases. To the extent the defendant argues that the requested relief is necessary to ensure that\ncourts adjudicating the Civil Cases are aware of the existence of the documents at issue, the\ndefendant identifies no specific reason why these materials are relevant to the issues pending in\nthose cases, other than to falsely accuse the Recipient and the Government of some sort of\nmalfeasance.°\n\nIn sum, the defendant’s arguments in favor of her application offer no <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> of the\nrelevant legal theory the materials would support, not to mention a compelling reason for this Court\nto permit an end-run around the protective order and permit the use of criminal discovery to litigate\na civil case.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter to propose certain redactions to the\ndefendant’s leter of August l7, 2o2o (the “Defense Leter”) and to request that the exhibits\natached to the Defense Leter be filed under seal during the pendency of an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation. For the reasons set forth belou, the Government respectfully requests that the Court\npermit the filing of the Defense Leter with the proposed redactions contained in Exhibit A hereto\n(which itself will be submited to the Court under seal), and that the Court permit all of the exhibits\nto the Defense Leter to be filed under seal. The Government does not object to the public filing\nof the affidavit atached to the Defense Leter in unredacted form. Additionally, the Government\nwill file a redacted version of this leter on the public docket, and separately will submit an\nunreduced version to the Court.\n\nAs an initial mater, the proposed redactions, and the request that the exhibits be filed under\nseal, are consistent with the Government’s designation of the underlying material as “Confidential”\nwithin the meaning of the Protective Order in this case. See Protective Order 4 l5 (Dkt. 36).\nMoreover, as detailed more fully in the Government’s companion submission, that designation is\nappropriate given the nature of the documents at issue, all of which pertain to the Government’s\npending grand jury investigation.! That alone strongly weighs in favor of permiting the redactions\nand sealed filings at issue: Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e)(6) provides, in relevant part,\n‘To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the\nnature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental\nleter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an\n<span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span>.\n\nApp.o95\nDOJ-OGR-oool9554\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019560.jpg": "Came PAB OOBBouANeht DOCOURBAT-AIL o Fd DS7o2)289 eh AGB HS\ncase in other civil proceedings. She bases her request on the premise that disclosure of the\nDocuments to the relevant judicial officers is allegedly necessary to ensure the fair adjudication\nof issues being litigated in those civil maters. But after fourteen single-spaced pages of heated\nrhetoric, the Defendant proffers no more than vague, speculative, and conclusory assertions as to\nwhy that is the case. She provides no coherent <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> of what argument she intends to\nmake before those courts that requires the presentation of the materials received in discovery in\nthis criminal mater under the existing terms of the protective order in this case. And she\nfurnishes no substantive <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> regarding the relevance of the Documents to decisions to be\nmade in those maters, let alone any <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> of why modifying the protective order in order\nto allou such disclosure is necessary to ensure the fair adjudication of those maters. In sum, the\narguments the Defendant presents to the Court plainly fail to establish good cause.

See Dkt. No. 46. In the opening paragraph of her\nreply leter dated August 24, 2o2o, the Defendant states that she is essentially seeking to disclose\nunder seal to certain judicial officers the follouing factual information:\n\nl.

(A. 93-94).\nD. Judge Nathan’s Order\n\nOn September 2, 2o2o, Judge Nathan issued the\nOrder denying Maxwell’s motion. (A. 99-lo3). In that\nOrder, Judge Nathan noted that despite “fourteen-sin-\ngle spaced pages of heated rhetoric,” Maxwell had of-\nfered “no more than vague, speculative, and conclusory\nassertions” regarding why the criminal discovery ma-\nterials were necessary to fair adjudication of her civil\ncases. (A. lol). Judge Nathan concluded that absent\nany “coherent <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span>” of hou the criminal discov-\nery materials related to any argument Maxwell in-\ntended to make in civil litigation, Maxwell had\n“plainly” failed to establish good cause to modify the\nProtective Order. (A. lol). Further, Judge Nathan\nnoted that the basic facts Maxwell sought to introduce\nin civil litigation were already made public through\nthe Government’s leter in opposition to her motion.\n(A. lol-o2). Accordingly, even though Judge Nathan\n“remain|[ed] in the dark as to why this information will\nbe relevant” to the courts adjudicating the civil cases,\nJudge Nathan expressly permited Maxwell to inform\nthe tribunals overseeing her civil cases, under seal, of\nthe basic factual background regarding the confiden-\ntial criminal discovery materials at issue. (A. lol-o2).\nE. Maxwell’s Appeal of the Order\n\nOn September 4, 2o2o, Maxwell filed a notice of ap-\npeal from the Order. (A. l2l-23). On September lo,\n2o2o, Maxwell filed a motion to consolidate this appeal\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool962o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019638.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Page3l of 37\n25\n\ncertain discovery materials would impact the unseal-\ning analysis under First Amendment principles in a\ncivil mater. Even if Maxwell were correct that the way\nin which the Government obtained the materials was\nimproper—and she is not—that fact would have no\nbearing on the analysis of whether materials in certain\ncivil cases should be unsealed. Maxwell cites not a sin-\ngle case to support the conclusion that her desire to\nprevent the Government from raising an inevitable\ndiscovery argument in suppression litigation should\nimpact the unsealing analysis in a civil case. She offers\nno coherent argument for hou the criminal discovery\nmaterials would impact any decision in a civil case.\n\nAt botom, it remains unclear what legal argument\nMaxwell wishes to make in her civil cases based on the\ncriminal discovery materials she has identified or\nwhat relevance those materials have to the litigation\nof those civil maters. Accordingly, Judge Nathan did\nnot abuse her discretion when concluding that Max-\nwell “furnishe[d] no substantive <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> regarding\nthe relevance of the Documents to decisions to be made\nin those maters, let alone any <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> of why\nmodifying the protective order in order to allou such\ndisclosure is necessary to ensure the fair adjudication\nof those maters.” (A. lol).\n\nIn pressing for a different result here, Maxwell ar-\ngues that “if the deposition material is unsealed, it\nmay foreclose” any of her arguments to Judge Nathan\nabout the perjury counts or other remedies available\nto Maxwell based on the Government’s alleged circum-\nvention of Second Circuit law. (Br. 27). Maxwell claims\nthat “all [she] seeks in this appeal is the ability to\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9638\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019639.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Page32 of 37\n26\n\nmake these arguments to Judge Preska and Judge Na-\nthan before it’s too late.” (Br. 27-28). To the extent\nMaxwell seeks to challenge the manner in which the\nGovernment obtained the materials at issue—a chal-\nlenge that itself would not justify the relief presently\nrequested—Maxwell can make such arguments before\nJudge Nathan, and the Government can and will vig-\norously oppose them, at the appropriate stage in the\ncase.\n\nIf anything, this appeal appears to be a thinly\nveiled atempt to have this Court weigh in on the Gov-\nernment’s investigative methods. Her briefing is filled\nwith accusations of impropriety on the part of the Gov-\nernment but with virtually no <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> of hou that\nsupposed impropriety relates to any civil case. It ap-\npears that Maxwell would like this Court to agree that\nthe Government illegally obtained evidence before the\nissue has even been briefed before Judge Nathan. This\nCourt’s precedents do not countenance such efforts to\nbypass district courts. See, e.g., Frontera Res. Azer.\nCorp. v. State Oil Co. of the Azer. Republic, 582 F.3d\n393, 4ol (2d Cir. 2oo9) (because issue “ha[d] not been\ndecided” by district court, “it would be premature for\nus to address this question without hearing first from\nthe court belou”). Maxwell presents no sound reason\nto deviate from precedent here, nor is one readily ap-\nparent. Maxwell is fully capable of litigating any sup-\npression motions in the District Court, and will have\nan opportunity to do so.\n\nMaxwell suggests that the “very point of this ap-\npeal” is to share information with Judge Preska under\nseal. (Br. ll). She asks that this Court permit her to\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9639\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019642.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Page35 of 37\n29\nshe can appeal to this Court follouing the entry of final\njudgment in the criminal case.\n\nMaxwell presented Judge Nathan with no coherent\nreason—not to mention good cause—to modify the\nduly entered Protective Order in this criminal case. In\nthe absence of any <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> of Maxwell’s need to\nuse criminal discovery materials to litigate a civil case,\nJudge Nathan was well within her discretion when de-\ntermining that Maxwell’s arguments “plainly fail to es-\ntablish good cause.” (A. lol). Judge Nathan’s Order\nfalls comfortably within the range of permissible deci-\nsions on a motion to modify a protective order, and so\nshe did not abuse her discretion in so ruling.\nthe criminal trial would likely have been subject to\ndeposition. That concern, among others, raised a sig-\nnificant risk that proceeding with the civil mater\nwould adversely affect the ongoing criminal prosecu-\ntion against Maxwell. Moreover, the interests of judi-\ncial economy and the public interest in enforcement of\nthe criminal law were served by a stay in the Doe case\nbecause the outcome of the criminal case could resolve\ndisputed issues in the Doe case.

In this respect, the Government further notes that the\nIndictment brought in this District is entirely independent of the prior SDFL investigation, and two\nof the victims referenced in the Indictment were never approached or interviewed by the SDFL,\nand had never spoken to law enforcement until they met with our Office in 2ol9.\n\nNor is there any force to the defendant’s assertion — without <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span>, much less legal\nauthority — that the charges in the Indictment are untimely. As the Government explained in its\nopening brief, the charges in this case are timely, pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3283, which permits the\nprosecution of crimes involving the sexual abuse of minors at any time during the life of the victim.\nThe defendant’s claim that the Indictment is barred by the statute of limitations has no basis in\nlaw.

Opposition Memorandum at l9. These conclusory\nclaims are baseless.\n\nIll. The Defendant Poses An Extreme Risk of Flight\n\nAs the Government detailed in its opening brief, the defendant’s international ties,\nconsiderable financial resources, and transient lifestyle all make her a risk of flight. That risk is\nfurther exacerbated by the fact that the defendant is a citizen of France, which does not extradite\nits citizens to the United States pursuant to French law. In addition, and as detailed further belou,\nthe defendant has not only the motive to flee, but the means to do so swiftly and effectively. The\ndefendant appears to have access to extensive sources of wealth. She does not have a job that\nwould tie her to the United States, much less the Southern District of New York, and she does not\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oool99o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019983.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 39-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Pagel24 of 2oo 6l\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl The government also says, well, she has l5 different\n\n2 bank accounts -- and here we get some hedging language -- that\n3 are by or associated with her.

One was a\nl4 transfer of 5oo,ooo. We believe that what that is was a bond\nl5 maturing.

What's that refer to? It refers to one of\n22 the themes we have been talking about in our submission and\n23 today your Honor. When Mr. Epstein was arrested, it had all\n24 kinds of effects on our client, one of which was that the bank\n25 in question referenced in the government's submission dropped\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool9983\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020143.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcinde rt l/262 FileehBa3o/Ptag Pad ef Goof 22\nwas the result of the Defendant’s misestimation rather than misdirection. And while the\nDefendant’s concerns regarding her spouse’s privacy are not insignificant, she fails to furnish\nany <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> as to why those concerns led her to misrepresent key facts to Pretrial Services\nand, by extension, the Court. In sum, the evidence of a lack of candor is, if anything, stronger\nnou than in July 2o2o, as it is clear to the Court that the Defendant’s representations to Pretrial\nServices were woefully incomplete. That lack of candor raises significant concerns as to\nwhether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate picture of her finances and as to the\nDefendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of release.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that the third factor continues to weigh\nin favor of detention.\n\nC. Pretrial detention continues to be warranted\n\nIn light of the reasons stated above, the Government has again met its burden of\npersuasion by “a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight.”\nEnglish, 629 F.3d at 3l9 (quoting Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436). Taking the § 3l42(g) factors into\naccount, the Court concludes that the presumption in favor of detention, the nature and\ncharacteristics of the charged offenses, the weight of the evidence, and the history and\ncharacteristics of the Defendant all weigh in favor of detention. Along similar lines, the\nGovernment has also shoun, and the Court concludes for the reasons outlined belou, that the\nDefendant’s proposed bail package cannot reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, the Court’s\noriginal conclusion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and that no set of conditions can\nreasonably assure her future appearance remains unaltered.\n\nAs already noted, the Defendant nou proposes a $28.5 million bail package, which\nincludes a $22.5 million personal recognizance bond co-signed by the Defendant and her spouse\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol43\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020232.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 56, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o7529l, Page’ of 3\nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\nThurgood Marshall U.S. Courthouse 4o Foley Square, New York, NY looo7 Telephone: 2l2-857-85oo\nMOTION INFORMATION STATEMENT\n\nDocketNumber(s): 2l-98, 2l-77o Caption fuse short tile]\nMotion for: Leave to file exhibit under seal\nSet forth belou precise, complete statement of relief sought:\nThe Government seeks leave to file exhibit under seal .\nOO TT I United States v.

Ex.Cat2). That same day, Judge Nathan directed\nthe Government to confer with MDC legal counsel and provide the District Court\nwith an <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> of what flashlight surveillance the MDC conducts on Maxwell\nat night, the basis for such surveillance, and the availability of an appropriate eye\ncovering for Maxwell’s use at night. (Dkt. 257).\n\nl9. On May 5, 2o2l, the Government submited a leter to Judge\nNathan conveying MDC legal counsel’s answers to the District Court’s questions.\n(Mot. Ex. D). First, the Government confirmed that all inmates at the MDC are\nsubject to some form of flashlight checks throughout the night for their safety and\nsecurity. In particular, MDC staff point a flashlight at the ceiling of each cell in\norder to illuminate the cell enough to confirm that each inmate “is present in the cell,\nbreathing, and not in distress.” (/d. at l). MDC staff conduct such checks every\n3o minutes in the Special Housing Unit (“SHU”), and approximately once per hour\nfor inmates housed in general population. (/d.). Because Maxwell is on an\nenhanced security schedule, MDC staff conduct these nightime checks on her every\nl5 minutes. (d.). Second, the Government conveyed that the MDC has\ndetermined that, although Maxwell is not on suicide watch, increased frequency of\nnightime monitoring is warranted in her case due to several factors that “raise\nheightened safety and security concerns,” including the charges she faces, the\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o368\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020369.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Pagell of 24\nincreased stress of a high-profile case, and her sleeping situation in a cell by herself\nwithout acellmate. (Ud. at2). Third, the Government noted that the MDC would\nnot permit Maxwell to have an eye mask because such an item is not available in\ncommissary and is not issued to inmates. (/d.). MDC staff do, houever, permit\nMaxwell to cover her eyes at night using other items that are available in commissary\nor that are issued to inmates. (/d.).\n\n2o. In response, on May 7, 2o2l, Maxwell filed a reply leter\ndisputing the MDC’s <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> for the implementation of an enhanced security\nschedule for Maxwell and raising additional concerns regarding conditions at the\nMDC beyond Maxwell’s sleeping conditions but without seeking particular relief as\nto those conditions. (Mot. Ex. E). At no point did Maxwell file an affidavit in\nsupport of her claims regarding the conditions of her confinement.\n\n2l. On May l4, 2o2l, Judge Nathan issued a writen decision\ndenying Maxwell’s request for an order directing the MDC to modify its nightime\nmonitoring schedule. (Mot. Ex. B). In reaching this decision, Judge Nathan\nnoted that Maxwell’s claim that MDC staff was shining a flashlight directly into her\neyes and disrupting her sleep was “unsupported by affidavit or other factual\nshouing.” (/d. atl). Judge Nathan emphasized that all MDC inmates are subject\nto nightime flashlight checks and found that “there are a number of neutral reasons”\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o369\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020376.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Pagel8 of 24\n\n34. Consistent with her practice throughout the pendency of this\ncase, Judge Nathan carefully considered Maxwell’s most recent complaint that\nnightime security checks by MDC staff interfere with her ability to prepare for trial.\nWhen Maxwell asked Judge Nathan to direct the MDC either to modify its nightime\nsurveillance procedures or to justify those procedures, Judge Nathan solicited a\nresponse from the MDC and evaluated the <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> provided. In so doing,\nJudge Nathan focused on whether the MDC implemented the contested protocol\nbased on neutral factors that justify any deviation from the ordinary practice.\n\n35. Maxwell faults Judge Nathan for not “tell[ing] the Bureau of\nPrisons what to do.” (Mot. at 2). But even assuming that it were proper for a\nDistrict Court to instruct the Bureau of Prisons regarding the details of operating a\njail, Maxwell fails to explain why it was unreasonable to conclude that an increase\nof nightime checks from the 3o-minute intervals applicable in the SHU to the l5-\nminute intervals applied to Maxwell was warranted given the specific factors that\nheighten safety and security concerns for Maxwell. Unlike most other inmates,\nMaxwell does not have a cellmate who could alert staff if she was in distress, and\nMaxwell faces very serious charges under the glare of a high-profile case, the stress\nof which increases the possibility that she may self-harm. Moreover, as Judge\nNathan noted, Maxwell offered no evidence to support the notion that those\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o376\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020450.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page64 of 9l\n\nll/l9/2o2l | 475 | JOINT LETTER by Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J.

Hearing Tr. at 7-l2. Those three inaccurate answers all stem from\nJuror 5o’s failure to disclose that he was sexually abused as a child. Under the Defendant’s\ninterpretation of McDenough, that would be sufficient to satisfy the first prong. But the\nGovernment’s interpretation requires that the Court make a further finding that the inaccurate\nanswers were made deliberately.\n\nAfter close consideration of the record, including Juror 5o’s testimony under oath, the\nCourt concludes that Juror 5o’s answers to the questionnaire, while incorrect, were not\ndeliberately inaccurate.

He faces the possibility of perjury charges if he testified falsely at the hearing. Juror 5o\ntherefore had a strong incentive to testify truthfully.\n\nMoreover, the Court credits Juror 5o’s testimony in light of his demeanor in testifying\nunder oath. At the hearing, the Court was able to closely observe Juror 5o as he testified and to\nassess his reaction to questions, including those he appeared not to expect, as well as to the\noverall tone of his answers. Juror 5o answered the Court’s questions in a calm and\nstraightforward manner. He was apologetic for his carelessness. His tone, demeanor, and\nresponsiveness gave no indication of false testimony.\n\nFurther, Juror 5o’s answers to the Court’s questions were logical explanations and\ngenerally internally consistent. He testified that his atention to the questionnaire was distracted\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o959\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020960.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel34 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page l7 of 4o\nby several factors, among them the several hours that he had to wait in the courthouse’s security\nline, to wait in the room to hear the Court’s instructional video, and then to begin answering\nquestions. And while he waited, he says, he was distracted by his thoughts on the recent end of a\nromantic relationship. /d. at l4 (“I didn’t have a phone, I didn’t have a book, I was siting there\ntwiddling my thumbs thinking about the break up that just happened a few weeks prior and\nsiting in my feelings and not very focused.”). That <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> is not only consistent with his\nother hearing testimony, but also with his sworn statements months earlier at oral voir dire. See\nNov. l6, 2o2l Voir Dire Tr. at l33 (stating that he “just got out of a relationship and I didn’t\nwant to see anything regarding them”).\n\nDistractions continued, and increased, as he neared the end of the questionnaire. Juror 5o\ntestified that he was seated near the table where prospective jurors dropped off their completed\nquestionnaires. As more potential jurors completed their questionnaires, the noise and bustle at\nthat table increased. And as more potential jurors completed their questionnaires, he “felt\nrushed” to finish so that he would not be the last to turn in a questionnaire. Hearing Tr. at l8.\nMoreover, the Court credits Juror 5o’s candid admission that he was not concerned with\nfollouing the Court’s instructions, and did not proceed with “diligence,” because he had\nconcluded that he would not be selected as a juror given the “sheer volume of people that were\nthere.” /d. at l3, l8; see also id. at 4o.\n\nThis <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> coheres with Juror 5o’s testimony that his sexual abuse history was not\na salient or front-of-mind consideration as he completed the questionnaire.

Hearing Tr. at 47; Questionnaire at 4. The Court finds that <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> to be reasonable.\n\nLast, the Court finds Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> that his answers were made inadvertently to\nbe the most logical <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> of his overall behavior. Shortly after trial, Juror 5o readily\ndisclosed the fact of his sexual abuse in several media interviews in which he used his real first\nname and pictures of himself. Finding that Juror 5o intentionally provided false answers on the\nquestionnaire requires concluding that he willingly disclosed his deliberate and unlawful\ndeception in public interviews. The more likely <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> for Juror 5o’s behavior is the one to\nwhich he credibly testified: Juror 5o’s inaccurate answers were provided inadvertently, and he\nwas made aware of his mistake only after he completed his media interviews. That <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span>\nis corroborated by a video recording of Juror 5o’s interview with the Daily Mail, which the\nDefendant entered into the record and previously cited in support of her claim for a new trial.\nSee Maxwell Br. at 39-4o. In that video, Juror 5o states that he was asked only about the sexual\nabuse history of his friends and family but not his oun. When the interviewer asks Juror 5o\nabout Question 48 in particular, he appears genuinely and completely surprised to learn that the\nquestionnaire included this question. That moment of surprise is consistent with Juror 5o’s\nhearing testimony that this was the moment at which he realized he may have made a serious, but\nhonest, mistake. See Hearing Tr. at l5 (stating that he first learned that the questionnaire may\nask about his oun sexual abuse history “during [his] Daily Mail interview with the reporter\nLaura Collins”).\n\nThe Defendant raises several arguments for why the Court should instead find that Juror\n5o commited perjury at the hearing and that his answers on the questionnaire were intentionally\ninaccurate. The Court is not persuaded. First, the Defendant characterizes much of Juror 5o’s\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o96l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020963.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel37 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 2o of 4o\nyes friend or family, or no.” /d. at l5,2l. Consistent with his <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> that he skimmed the\nquestionnaire, he testified that he “did not pick up on” that patern when filling out the\nquestionnaire, id. at l5, and read only “the friend or family” and “missed that ‘have you,’ and\nthen ‘yes self? while reading,” Question 48, id. at 2l. And when asked a follou-up question,\nJuror 5o said he was not “surprised” at the time, but only surprised “thinking nou” that the\nquestionnaire had asked about the sexual abuse history of friends and family but not about a\njuror’s oun sexual abuse history. /d. at 2l-22. The Court finds that Juror 5o’s answers to each\nof these lines of questioning were reasonable and credible.\n\nThird, the Defendant argues that, as to Question 49, Juror 5o was inconsistent in first\nstating that he was sexually abused by “a family member, who is no longer part of the family,”\nbut then stating that he “never considered [the stepbrother] part of [his] family even when they\nlived with us for a few years.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9-lo (quoting Hearing Tr. at 8, ll).\nThe Court acknouledges the tension between these two statements, but does not agree that\ntension suggests Juror 5o deliberately concealed his stepbrother’s abuse. Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span>\nof his answer to Question 49 proceeded in three stages. He clarified, first, that on November 4,\nhe “didn’t even consider . . . at all” whether his stepbrother’s conduct was responsive to Question\n49 as he “flew through” the questionnaire. Hearing Tr. at ll-l2. At the hearing, he initially\nstated that “No” was an accurate answer because, as the Defendant notes, he “never considered”\nthe stepbrother to be a member of his family. /d. And finally, when asked whether, “[a]s [he]\nsit[s] here nou,” what his answer to Question 49 would be, Juror 5o said “it would have been\nyes” because “by law, by marriage, that person was [his] stepbrother.” Jd. at l2-l3. In short, it\nwas only after Juror 5o was made to reflect on the question and its answer that he reached an\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o963\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020964.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel38 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 2l of 4o\naccurate response. Yet Juror 5o did not read closely Question 49 or consider carefully his\nanswer to it on November 4.\n\nThese evolving answers do not reflect Juror 5o changing his story so much as an\n<span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> of a complex and fraught set of events and relationships from decades before. The\nCourt is cognizant that jurors may well assign their oun emotional connotations to terms like\n“family” rather than interpret it in the technical or legal manner as would an atorney or judge.\nCf. United States v. Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d 432, 438 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo4) (“Would a reasonable\njuror necessarily consider an ex-girlfriend to be ‘someone close to him?””).\n\nFourth, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s proclaimed reluctance to disclose his sexual\nabuse is inconsistent with his post-trial conduct. Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5-6, lo-ll. In\nparticular, Juror 5o testified that he “[doesn’t] tell very many people” about his abuse. Hearing\nTr. at 22. Yet he conducted several interviews with international media outlets in which he\nrevealed his sexual abuse history. Further, Juror 5o posted a comment on social media to Annie\nFarmer, a witness in this case, in which he “thanked her for sharing [her] story.” /d. at 43.\nThese prominent disclosures of his sexual abuse, the Defendant argues, contradict Juror 5o’s\nstatement that he rarely disclosed that abuse.\n\nThe Court confronted Juror 5o at length about each of these purported contradictions. As\nto his interviews, the Court asked Juror 5o hou he “reconcile[d] what [he] just said” about\nnondisclosure with his high-profile disclosure in media interviews. /d. at 22. Juror 5o primarily\nprovided two overlapping explanations. He first testified that he “didn’t think this would\nhappen.” /d. That is, he explained, he “did not think that anybody— certainly [his] family or\nfriends would find this out,” despite the significant media atention that the case had received.\nId. at 23. When the Court returned to this issue later in the hearing, Juror 5o added that in the\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o964\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020965.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel39 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 22 of 4o\n\ninterviews he “wasn’t using [his] full name,” which Juror 5o apparently understood reduced the\nchance that people that knew him would draw the connection. /d. at 42. And, further, he\nexplained that several friends that contacted him after the trial were unaware of the trial\noccurring, so he assumed his post-trial media interviews would not atract substantial atention.\n\nSecond, Juror 5o simultaneously acknouledged that because of his interviews, the fact\nthat he was abused “would be a knoun fact in the world.” /d. at 24. He explained that he had\nmade a conscious decision in favor of disclosure because, “[a]fter siting on this trial for several\nweeks and seeing the victims be brave enough to give their stories, [he] felt” that he could too.\nId.; see also id. at 42 (‘Tm also not ashamed about it. It’s something that happened, and it’s\nsomething that is relatively common that happened to multiple people throughout the world.”).\n\nIn short, Juror 5o’s willingness to disclose his sexual abuse changed to some extent\nbetween November 4, 2o2l, and January 2o22. He made a conscious decision to share the fact\nof his sexual abuse with a wider circle of people than he had prior to the time that he completed\nthe questionnaire. At the same time, he presumed—in hindsight, mistakenly—that his\ninterviews, given without his last name and predominantly to international media outlets, would\nnot be seen by his friends or family in his life who, he believed, had not folloued the trial up to\nthat point. That <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> of partial public disclosure is further consistent with the fact that in\nhis interviews he related only the fact that he had been abused, not any details of what had\noccurred. Juror 5o’s wishful thinking—or as the Government suggests, naivety—with respect to\nhis post-trial interviews does not suggest that when he completed his questionnaire, he intended\nto deceive. See Government Post-Hearing Br. at lo n.4, Dkt. No. 648.\n\nThe Court also asked Juror 5o about his social media interaction with Annie Farmer. On\nTwiter, Farmer shared an article that contained an interview with Juror 5o and she said that\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o965\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020973.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel47 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 3o of 4o\nimpartial juror in such a trial. That is not the law, nor should it be. See Gonzales v. Thomas, 99\nF.3d 978, 989-9o (loth Cir. l996) (“To hold that no rape victim could ever be an impartial juror\nin a rape trial would, we think, insult not only all rape victims but also our entire jury system.”);\nBuckner v. Davis, 945 F.3d 9o6, 9l4-l5 (Sth Cir. 2ol9) (affirming conclusion that juror who\nfailed to disclose childhood abuse was not impliedly biased in conviction for sexual assault of a\nchild). Thus, the Court finds no basis to infer that Juror 5o is biased.\n\nThe Defendant’s arguments to the contrary do not disturb the Court’s conclusion that\nJuror 5o was neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o\nwas impliedly biased because of multiple “dishonest answers.” Maxwell Br. at 36; Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at ll.8 But this is not a case involving a juror’s extreme deceit due to a desire\nto be selected. By contrast, in United States v. Daugerdas, on which the Defendant extensively\nrelies, a juror “created a totally fictitious persona in her drive to get on the jury.” 867 F. Supp.\n2d 445, 473 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol2), vacated and remanded on other grounds, United States v. Parse,\n789 F.3d 83 (2d Cir. 2ol5). The court granted the defendant’s motion for a new trial,\nemphasizing the “deliberate lies engineered to create a fictitious, ‘marketable’ juror” warranted\n“extraordinary relief.” /d. at 468. Such is not the case here. The Court credits Juror 5o’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> that his nondisclosure was an “inadvertent mistake,” not intentional deception.\nHearing Tr. at l4-l5. Juror 5o explained hou the circumstances surrounding his completion of\nthe questionnaire—including his recent romantic breakup, that he had no expectation of being\nselected, the technical issues and ensuing long wait to begin the questionnaire, and the generally\ndistracting environment—resulted in his “skimming” the questionnaire and missing the personal\n8 The Defendant argued that these repeated lies included Juror 5o’s use of social media in her pre-hearing briefing.\nMaxwell Br. at 36. For the reasons stated in this Court’s February 25 Opinion, that Juror 5o used social media\naccounts after the completion of trial does not establish that he lied about having been inactive on social media\nbefore trial. Feb. 25, 2o2o Op. & Order, at 9-lo.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o973\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020977.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel5l of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 34 of 4o\nCircuit to affirm the district court’s order for a new penalty-phase hearing. Maxwell Br. at 33\n(citing Sampson, 724 F.3d at l68).\n\nThe Defendant next relies on a state court case, State v. Afshar, l96 A.3d 93 (N.H. 2ol8),\nin which a court granted a new trial in a child sexual assault case when a juror failed to disclose\nthat a babysiter sexually assaulted him when he was five or six years old. Maxwell Post-\nHearing Br. at 5; see also Maxwell Br. at 34. But that juror had previously reported an inability\nto be impartial in another case involving sexual assault of a minor, and the court concluded that\nthere was “litle in the way of logical <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> for hou he could have differentiated between\nthe two cases.” l96 A.3d at 98. Such is not the case here.\n\nFinally, in Burton v. Johnson, the Tenth Circuit concluded that a juror was impliedly\nbiased when she suffered an abusive relationship with her husband that was highly similar to that\nof the defendant. 948 F.2d ll5o, ll58-59 (loth Cir. l99l). Houever, not only had that juror\ndeliberately lied during voir dire about the experience, but she was also living in that abusive\nsituation during voir dire, the trial itself, and her post-verdict testimony to the court. /d.\nConversely, Juror 5o credibly testified that his abuse “happened so long ago” that it is not\nsomething that he “think[s] about,” “it’s not part of who [he is].” Hearing Tr. at 47. And again,\nthe Court has not found that Juror 5o deliberately lied about his personal history.\n\nThe Defendant’s remaining arguments also fail to alter the Court’s conclusion that Juror\n5o is not biased. The Defendant contends that Juror 5o’s post-trial conduct—in particular, his\nposts on social media and his decision to give interviews using his picture and first name—is\n“strong evidence” of his bias because he was “not looking to avoid notice,” but rather to “soak\nup his l5 minutes of fame.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at lo-ll. The Court disagrees that this\nconduct reveals bias. Whether wise or foolish, the fact that a juror may give an interview\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o977\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020978.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel52 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 35 of 4o\nfollouing a high-profile trial does not establish bias. This common occurrence is not necessarily\nnefarious. See Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 44o. Even if Juror 5o were selfishly seeking his\nfifteen minutes of fame, his interview “would have garmered the same amount of media atention\nafter a verdict of acquital.” Jd.\n\nThe Defendant next argues that “the victims’ testimony personally resonated with [Juror\n5o] in a way that jurors who had not been sexually abused as children would not have felt.”\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5—6. She argues this is evinced by his <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> that the victims’\ntestimony inspired him to give post-trial interviews and “tell his story” despite his apparently\nnormal reserve to discuss his sexual abuse pre-trial. /d. As noted above in this Court’s finding\nthat Juror 5o is not actually biased, Juror 5o’s statements regarding his post-trial view of the\nverdict and the Defendant do not illuminate pre-trial bias. A juror’s view of a case and defendant\nwould necessarily change after reviewing thirteen days of evidence that persuaded twelve jurors\nof the Defendant’s guilt. See Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 439-4o. It is unsurprising that such an\nexperience might change the way a juror views his oun life experiences.\n\nThe Defendant also argues that Juror 5o is biased because “his oun experience of sexual\nabuse shaped his beliefs about hou victims’ memories of traumatic events work.” Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at 6. The Defendant relies on Juror 5o’s statements in post-trial interviews and\nhis hearing testimony regarding his view of the evidence at trial. For example, Juror 5o noted at\nthe hearing that he referenced his abuse in interviews “in order to talk to a reporter about jury\ndeliberations” and to explain why he “believe[d] a certain way based on all the evidence that was\nprovided during the trial.” Hearing Tr. at 22. The Court does not agree, as an initial mater, that\nthese statements demonstrate bias. A foundational principle is that jurors rely on their common\nsense and life experiences to adjudge guilt. All jurors have no doubt experienced the recall of\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o978\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020980.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel54 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 37 of 4o\nwould prevent him from being fair or impartial. As discussed above, the minor discrepancies\nraised by the Defendant do not alter this assessment.”\n\nNor was Juror 5o’s inaccurate answer to Question 25 unreasonable. He testified that he\nunderstood the question to ask whether he “was robbed or mugged or some sort of crime like\nthat,” and that he did not think of his history of “sexual abuse as being a victim of a crime.”\nHearing Tr. at lo. Because neither he nor a friend or family member had been robbed or mugged.\nor been the victim of a similar type of crime, he testified, he answered “No” to Question 25.\n\nThat interpretation of what it means to be a victim of a crime, while technically incorrect, does\nnot evince intentional deception or partiality. Cf United States v. Fell, No. 2:ol-CR-l2, 2ol4\nWL 36978lo, at *7, *l3 (D. Vt. July 24, 2ol4) (crediting the <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> of a juror that was\nsexually abused as a child that she “ha[d] not considered [herself] a victim of a crime in all these\nyears” in part because the abuser was “not convicted of any crime”); McDonough, 464 U.S at\n555 (“[JJurors are not necessarily experts in English usage. Called as they are from all walks of\nlife, many may be uncertain as to the meaning of terms which are relatively easily understood by\nlawyers and judges.”). Evidently, other prospective jurors similarly interpreted Question 25 to\nnot refer to uncharged incidents of sexual abuse. For example, Juror C disclosed being ‘i\nee.” in response to Question 48, but in response to Question\n25, reported only that a family member was mugged. See Juror C Questionnaire.\nIn sum, the Court concludes that Juror 5o is not impliedly or inferably biased.\n° The Defendant also notes that Juror 5o apparently posted on social media about atending therapy to help “deal[]\nwith the stress of the [Maxwell] case.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9; see also Maxwell Br. at 2o. It is perfectly\nreasonable for a juror to go to therapy and use of such services does not disqualify a citizen from service. In fact,\ncourts in this district routinely make counseling services available to jurors follouing the completion of a trial.\n37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o98o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021011.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel85 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 28 of 45\npart of the same “set of discrete facts consistent with the charge in the indictment,” not a\npreviously unidentified and independent theory of guilt.

App’x 28, 3o (2d Cir. 2o2l) (summary order) (no constructive\namendment in sex trafficking case where indictment did not allege “advertising” but the\nevidence “fell squarely within the charged scheme” (cleaned up)).\n\nThird, the Government’s summation also reflected the core of criminality of transporting\nJane and other underage girls to New York with the intention that sexual activity would occur in\nNew York. In its summation regarding Count Four, the Government focused on travel to New\nYork. See Trial Tr. at 289l-92.° The Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> of Counts One and Three\nfolloued this patern as well, with the summation again making clear that the Defendant and\nEpstein had intended for the victims to be “sexually abused in New York.” /d. at 2895. Thus,\nthe Court’s instructions to the jury, the evidence presented at trial, and the Government’s\nargument in summation did not describe “behavior entirely separate from that identified in the\nindictment,” Bastian, 77o F.3d at 223 (quoting Danielson, l99 F.3d at 67o), but instead\nconsistently captured the core of criminality with which the Defendant was charged.\n\n2. Thejury note and the Court’s response did not result ina\nconstructive amendment.\n\nThe Defendant contends that regardless of whether the Court’s prior instructions or\nGovernment’s arguments at trial were proper, a jury note revealed that the jury convicted the\nDefendant for intending that Jane engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, not New York. See\nMaxwell Reply at 2.

(citing Cornielle, l7l\nF.3d at 75l).\n\nIn its prior rulings, this Court concluded that the Defendant satisfied neither requirement:\nthere was “no evidence that the Government’s delay in bringing these charges was designed to\nthwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense,” and she “failed to establish actual prejudice from\nthe Government’s delay.” /d. at 3l6-l7. But, the Court explained, the Defendant could renew\nher motion if the factual record at trial shoued prejudice that the pretrial record did not. The\nDefendant nou renews her motion, identifying a bevy of documentary records and witnesses\nthat, she says, were unavailable because of the Government’s delay. The Court, for the reasons\nstated belou, disagrees and denies the motion.\n\nAs an initial mater, even if the Court accepts all of the Defendant’s contentions in her\nbriefing, her pre-indictment delay claim must fail because the Defendant has made no claim that\nthe Government intentionally delayed the Indictment to gain a tactical advantage over the\nDefendant. United States v. Alameh, 34l F.3d l67, l76 (2d Cir. 2oo3). The Court has twice\nconcluded that “nothing in the record indicates that the Government’s delay in bringing these\ncharges was designed to thwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense.” Maxwell, 2o2l WL\n359l8ol, at *5. It is the Defendant’s burden to prove the Government’s improper motive, but in\nher briefing she does not atempt to present evidence of intentional delay for tactical advantage.\nThe Court therefore does not alter its prior conclusion. If anything, as the Government notes,\ntestimony at trial supplied legitimate explanations for the Government’s failure to indict the\nDefendant at an earlier time.

But the court refused to correct the jurors’ misunderstanding, merely\ndirecting them to the charge which they had in their possession and to which they\nwere already plainly referring when they asked about the “second element” of\n“count four.” Jane’s testimony about sexual abuse in New Mexico, to which the\nNote referred, presented the jury with an alternative basis for conviction that was\nentirely distinct from the charges in the Indictment.

Introduction\n\nAfter the trial concluded, a juror gave multiple interviews in which he\ndisclosed that he actively used his oun self-described traumatic experience as a\nvictim of child sexual abuse to convince certain members of the jury to overlook\nissues of credibility surrounding the victims and to convict Maxwell. Defendant\nmoved for a new trial, contending that the juror’s presence on the jury violated her\nSixth Amendment right to an impartial jury. Dkt 6l3, 642. The court ordered an\nevidentiary hearing limited to questions concerning Juror 5o’s false statements on\nthe juror questionnaire. A239.\n\nAt the hearing, Juror 5o gave a patently absurd <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> for his failure to\ngive truthful answers to multiple questions on the juror questionnaire.\nNevertheless, the court found that Juror 5o testified credibly at the hearing and that\nJuror 5o would not have been stricken for cause even if he had answered each\nquestion on the questionnaire accurately. Accordingly, the court concluded that\nDefendant failed to satisfy the demanding requirements of the controlling Supreme\n\n63\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll25\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021134.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page87 of ll3\ntestimony was credible and that, had he given truthful answers during voir dire, he\nwould not have been dismissed for cause.\n\nThe District Court erred when it did not find any bias (actual, implied, or\ninferred) on the part of Juror 5o. Juror 5o’s testimony revealed that he was not, and\ncould not have been, a fair and impartial juror. At the outset, Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span>\nfor his untruthful responses on the questionnaire only as to questions that would\nhave revealed his sexual abuse history were not credible, rendering his self-serving\nstatements that he was unbiased unreliable. His post-verdict statements shou hou\nclosely he identified with the victims in this case. For example, Juror 5o stated that\nthe verdict against Maxwell was a verdict “for all the victims.” During his hearing\ntestimony, he told the trial court that after “seeing the victims be brave enough to\ngive their story, I felt like if they can do it, so can I.” (H. 24.) As a victim of child\nsexual abuse, he was not capable of “separating [his] oun life experiences from the\nevidence in the case.” Sampson, 724 F. 3d at l67.\n\nThe court abused its discretion when it credited Juror 5o’s patchwork of self-\nserving explanations for his false answers to questions that could have led to the\ndisclosure of his sexual abuse history.

MARCH 2oo5 — MAY 2oo6: EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM\nBEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE\nATTORNEY’S OFFICE\nA. The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, identified as the recipient of the massage, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\nb As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per massage. The girl claimed that there were nude photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\ninvestigate prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021230.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONG 3536o38, Pageds of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 56 of 348\nhe is comfortable before proceeding.” Menchel told Villafafia he had “trouble understanding” why\nshe was in a “rush” “given hou long this case has been pending.”\n\nOPR questioned Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta about the timeline for reviewing\nthe prosecution memorandum and the proposed charges. Acosta and Menchel believed Villafafia’s\ntimeline was unrealistic from the start. Acosta told OPR that Villafafia was “very hard charging,”\nbut her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.” Menchel described Villafafia\nas “out over her skis a litle bit” and “ahead of’ Acosta in terms of his analysis of the case.*°\nMenchel said it was clear to him that Acosta “was going to be the one making the call” about\nwhether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision. Menchel\ntold OPR, “This [was] not a case [we were] going to review in two weeks and make a decision\non.” Sloman told OPR that although he did not conduct a “granular review” of the proposed\ncharges, he believed Menchel and Lourie had done so and “obviously” had concluded that “the\nfacts and the law didn’t suggest that the right thing to do was to automatically indict.” Lourie told\nOPR that he believed “the case was moving ahead.”\n\nVillafafia continued to seek direction from her managers. On May l5, 2oo7, she emailed\nSloman, noting that “[i]t seemed from our discussion yesterday that pestering Alex [Acosta] will\nnot do any good. Am I right about that?” Sloman responded, “Yes.” On May 2l, 2oo7, three\nweeks after submiting the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia emailed Sloman and Menchel\nasking for ‘“‘a sense of the direction where we are headed-l.e., approval of an indictment something\nlike the current draft, a complaint to allou for pre-indictment negotiations, an indictment\ndrastically different from the current draft?” Sloman responded only, “Taken care of.’””*°\n\nD. Defense Counsel Seek a Meeting with Senior USAO Managers, which\n\nVillafafia Opposes\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein’s defense counsel continued to seek additional information about the\nfederal investigation and a meeting with senior USAO managers, including Acosta. In a May lo,\n2oo7 email to Menchel, Lourie reported that Epstein’s atorneys “want me to tell them the statutes\n44 Villafafia explained to OPR that the “rush” related to her concern that Epstein was continuing to abuse girls:\n“Tn terms of the issue of why the hurry, because child sex offenders don’t stop until they’re behind bars. That was our\ntime concern.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia offering this <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> to him. OPR\nnotes that in their respective statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafafia\nexpressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events. When it was necessary for OPR to resolve those\nconflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the extensive documentary record and the\ntestimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.\n\n45 Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafafia was “ahead of where the office was internally” and\nthat caused “discontent” between Villafafia and Menchel. Villafafia was not the only one, houever, who was surprised\nthat the indictment was not approved immediately. The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed”\nafter Villafafia submited the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum touards an indictment abated. Villafafia’s\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case prosecuted.”\nHouever, Menchel rebuked Villafafia in his July 5, 2oo7 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing\ncharges in] this mater was a foregone conclusion.”\n\n46 Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he\nhad spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l23o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021236.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 6D 3536o38, Page64 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 62 of 348\n\ndamages.°°? During a two-month period, the subject atorneys were involved to varying degrees in\nconverting the broad outline into specific terms, resulting in the NPA signed by Epstein on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both\nthe larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of\nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this resolution. Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the\nfacts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea resolution or the NPA.\n\nIn the follouing account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous\ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR\nquestioned each of the subjects about hou the decision was reached to pursue a state resolution,\nand OPR includes belou the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA, June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”°° In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could\n32 State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw enforcement and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities. The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry\nis administered by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n58 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l236\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021237.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N63 3536o38, Page65 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 63 of 348\ninclude concurrent time.” The email primarily concerned other issues, and Villafafia did not\nexplain what the resolution she had in mind would entail.°’ Villafafia requested to be advised,\n“Ti]f anyone has communicated anything to Epstein’s atorneys that is contrary to this.” Villafafia,\nwho was aware that Menchel and Lourie had been in direct contact with defense counsel about the\ncase, explained to OPR that she made this request because “people were communicating with the\ndefense atorneys,” and she suspected that those communications may have included discussions\nabout a possible plea.\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s email, Menchel notified Villafafia that he had told Sanchez “a\nstate plea [with] jail time and sex offender status may satisfy the [U.S. Atorney],” but Sanchez\nhad responded that it “was a non-starter for them.”°’ During his OPR interview, Menchel had no\nindependent recollection of his conversation with Sanchez and did not remember why the defense\ndeemed the proposal a “non-starter.” Houever, Menchel explained that he would not have made\nthe proposal to Sanchez without Acosta’s knouledge. He also pointed out that in numerous emails\nbefore the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, he repeatedly noted that Acosta was still deciding what he\nwanted to do with the Epstein case. Acosta agreed, telling OPR that although he did not remember\na specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based resolution, Menchel would not have\ndiscussed a potential resolution with Sanchez “without having discussed it with me.”\n\nl. Acosta’s <span class=\"highlight\">Explanation</span> for His Decision to Pursue a State-based\nResolution\n\nSubsequent events shoued that the decision to resolve the case through state charges was\npivotal, and OPR extensively questioned Acosta about his reasoning. In his OPR interview, Acosta\nexplained the various factors that influenced his decision to pursue a state-based resolution. Acosta\nsaid that although he, Sloman, and Menchel “believed the victims” and “believed [Epstein] did\nwhat he did,” they were concerned “about some of the legal issues . . . and some of the issues in\nterms of testimony.” Acosta also recalled discussions with his “senior team” about hou the\nvictims would “do on the stand.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “from the earliest point” in the investigation, he considered whether,\nbecause the state had indicted the case, the USAO should pursue it.\n\nSf Villafafia explained to OPR that she intended to recommend a plea to a federal conspiracy charge and a\nsubstantive charge, “consistent with the Ashcroft Memo, which would be the most readily provable offense,” with “a\nrecommendation that the sentence on the federal charges run concurrent with the state sentence, or that [Epstein]\nwould receive credit for time in state custody touards his federal release date.” See n.65 for an <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> of the\nAshcroft Memo.\n\n58 Villafafia was then in trial and on July 4, 2oo7, likely before reading Menchel’s email, Villafafia responded\nto defense counsel regarding the demand for records and also noted, “If you would like to discuss the possibility of a\nfederal resolution . . . that could run concurrently with any state resolution, please leave a message on my voicemail.”\nSY In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Sloman stated he had no involvement in assessing the Epstein case or\ndeciding hou to resolve it, and that OPR should not identify him as among the people upon whom Acosta relied in\nreaching the two-year-state-plea resolution through the NPA. Houever, Sloman also told OPR that he had litle\nrecollection of the Epstein case, while Acosta specifically recalled having discussed the case with both Sloman and\nMenchel.\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l237\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021248.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page/6 of 258\nSA-74\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 74 of 348\nD. Acosta Decides on a Resolution That Includes a Two-Year Term of\nIncarceration\n\nThe next critical step in the development of the NPA was the decision to propose a two-\nyear term of imprisonment. Although presented to the defense as the “minimum” the USAO would\naccept, in actuality the two-year proposal became only the starting point for the negotiations, with\nthe result that the defense continued to chip away at it as the negotiations continued. The\ncontemporaneous emails make no mention of any rationale for the decision to propose two years\nas the government’s beginning negotiating position, and nobody with whom OPR spoke was able\nto recall hou the decision was made. As discussed belou, Acosta did offer OPR an <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span>,\nbut OPR was unable to find contemporaneous evidence supporting it.’°\n\nWhile the defense was communicating its objections to the federal investigation to\nVillafafia, Lourie, Menchel, and Sloman, Villafafia continued moving touard filing charges. On\nJuly l9, 2oo7, the day after receiving Oosterban’s email supporting a potential prosecution,\nVillafafia emailed Lourie and Menchel seeking approval to take further investigative steps\nregarding three of Epstein’s assistants. Houever, Menchel directed Villafafia to “hold off... until\nwe decide what course of action we are going to take on [E]pstein which should happen next\nweek.” Menchel told OPR that he did not specifically recall why he asked Villafafia to wait, but\nhe assumed it was because Acosta was deciding what course of action to take on the case.\n\nOn Monday, July 23, 2oo7, Menchel submited a resignation notice to Acosta, stating that\nhe would be leaving the USAO effective August 6, 2oo7.77\n\nl. The July 26, 2oo7 Meeting in Miami\n\nEarly on the morning of Thursday, July 26, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Menchel that she was\npreparing a new draft indictment containing revisions he had suggested, including removal of all\nbut three of the “travel counts” and “a large number of [the] overt acts,” and the addition of overt\nacts and counts relating to two additional victims; she would not, houever, have the revised\nindictment ready in time “for our discussion today” at their 2:oo p.m. meeting. Menchel told OPR\nthat the fact that he had both proposed revisions to the indictment and also directed Villafafia to\ndelay the investigative steps involving the assistants indicated that he was “trying to do something”\nwith the case, but was waiting for Acosta to decide the “underlying issue” of whether to proceed\nwith federal charges.\n\nAcosta made that decision on or before July 26, 2oo7. On that afternoon, Villafafia met in\nMiami with Menchel. She told OPR that Sloman, as well as the FBI case agents and their\nsupervisors, were also present, with Lourie participating by telephone. Villafafia told OPR that\nshe expected that the meeting, requested by Menchel, would address the direction of the\ninvestigation. Houever, Villafafia told OPR that after everyone had assembled, Menchel entered\nthe room and stated that Acosta “has decided to offer a two-year state deal.” According to\nis See Section IV.D.2 in this Part.\n77 As early as May 4, 2oo7, Menchel had informed Acosta that he was intending to leave the USAO to enter\nprivate practice.\n\n48\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l248\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021249.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye, ae 3536o38, Page/7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 75 of 348\nVillafafia, Menchel left the meeting after almost no discussion, leaving Villafafia “shocked and\nstunned.”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall the July 26, 2oo7 meeting. Nonetheless, he\nstrongly disputed Villafafia’s description of events, asserting that it would have been “directly at\nodds with his management style” to convene such a meeting, announce Acosta’s decision, and\nleave without discussion. Acosta told OPR that he had “decided and endorsed this resolution at\nsome point,” but he did not recall being aware that Menchel was going to announce the decision\nat the July 26 meeting; in addition, although Acosta did not recall the circumstances of Menchel’s\nrelaying of that decision, he said it “would have been consistent with” his decision for Menchel to\ndo so. Neither Sloman nor Lourie recalled the meeting. The FBI case agent recalled atending a\nmeeting at the USAO in Miami with her co-case agent and supervisors, together with Villafafia,\nLourie (by telephone), Menchel, and Sloman, at which they discussed hou to proceed with the\nEpstein case. According to the case agent, at this meeting the FBI insisted that Epstein be\nregistered for life as a sexual offender, and the co-case agent advocated for waiting until the court\nhad ruled on the USAO’s ability to obtain Epstein’s computer equipment.\n\nRegardless of exactly hou Acosta’s decision regarding the two-year term was\ncommunicated to Villafafia and the FBI agents, and regardless of who initially proposed the\nspecific term, the record shous that Acosta ultimately made the decision to offer Epstein a\nresolution that included a two-year term of imprisonment, as he acknouledged. ”\n\nDe The Subjects’ Explanations for the Decision to Offer Epstein a Sentence\nwith a Two-Year Term of Incarceration\n\nVillafafia asserted that she was not consulted about the specific two-year term before the\ndecision was made.”” Villafafia told OPR that she had worked hard to develop a strong case, and\nnone of her supervisors had identified to her any specific problem with the case that, in her view,\nexplained the decision to extend an offer for a two-year sentence. Villafafia also told OPR that\nMenchel provided no <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> for this decision during the July 26, 2oo7 meeting, and Villafafia\ndid not ask for an <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> because she accepted his statement that it was Acosta’s decision.\nVillafafia described the proposal as “random,” and told OPR, “[W]e’re all [sentencing] guidelines\npeople, so 24 months just makes no sense in the context of the guidelines. There’s no way to get\nto 24 months with this set of offenses.”°°\n78 OPR notes that Villafafia did not appear hesitant to send emails to her supervisors seting forth her views and\nobjections, and there is no reference before this meeting in any of her emails indicating that a decision had been made\nto offer a two-year term of incarceration. Therefore, given that a meeting had been arranged involving Menchel and\nVillatfafia, and possibly most of the other primary USAO and FBI participants, it seems logical that Acosta made a\ndecision to resolve the case with a two-year state plea not long before the meeting.\n\na OPR found no evidence in the documentary record indicating that Villafafia had knouledge of Acosta’s\ndecision or the two-year term before the July 26, 2oo7 meeting at which she said she learned of it.\n4a From the time the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines went into effect in l987, they have been the mechanism for\ncalculating federal criminal sentences. Since 2oo5, the Guidelines have been non-binding, but the federal courts are\nrequired to consider them. As noted in the commentary to USAM § 9-27.7lo,\n49\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l249\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021266.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document E92 3536o38, Page94 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 92 of 348\ngoing to become a registered sex offender, and he was going to go actually do time—which he\nhadn’t done up to this point.” Krischer asked, ‘““Why would I turn that doun?” Krischer also noted\nthat at that time, sexual offender registration “was not the norm” in Florida, and he recognized that\n“it was clearly something that was important to the U.S. Atorney’s Office.” l°\n\nAcosta told OPR that he did not recall if he learned what transpired at the September l2\nmeeting, nor did he recall why the USAO team agreed to permit Epstein to plead guilty to only\none charge. Acosta told OPR, houever, that he recognized that Villafafia and Lourie needed “some\ndegree of discretion to negotiate”; that “in the give and take” of negotiations, they might propose\na concession; and he was comfortable with the concession as long as the charge to which Epstein\nultimately pled “captured the conduct” in an “appropriate” way.\n\nAlthough Epstein’s atorneys expressed interest in Epstein serving his time in a county\nfacility (rather than state prison), one of Epstein’s atorneys alternatively expressed interest in\nEpstein serving his time in a federal facility, and along with discussions about the possible state\nresolution, the USAO and Epstein’s counsel also discussed a possible federal plea with a sentence\nrunning concurrently to the sentence Epstein would receive on the already indicted state charge.\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz an email advising that she and Lourie had talked with\nAcosta and Sloman, and they were “all satisfied in principle with the agreement.”'”’ The next day,\nSeptember l3, 2oo7, Villafafia sent an email to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and two other supervisors,\nidentifying potential federal offenses that would yield a two-year sentence. Villafafia also emailed\ndefense counsel, stating that she had been “spending some quality time with Title l8”—referring\nto the code of federal criminal statutes—to make sure there would be a “factual basis” for any\nfederal plea, and identifying the federal statutes she was considering.\n\nC. The Evidence Does Not Clearly Shou Why the Term of Incarceration Was\n\nReduced from 24 Months to 2o Months to l8 Months\n\nOPR reviewed the contemporaneous records and asked Acosta, Villafafia, and Lourie to\nexplain hou the jail term Epstein would have to accept came to be reduced from two years to l8\nmonths. Lourie had no recollection of the process through which the term of incarceration was\nreduced. Villafafia and Acosta offered significantly different explanations.\n\nVillafafia told OPR:\n\nWe had this flip flop between is it going to be a state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge, is it going to be [a] state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge? And to get to a federal charge, there\n\nwas no way to do 24 months that made any sense. So somehou it\n\nended up being 2o months and then it got to be l8 months. And\n\nthese were calls that if I remember correctly, Jay Lefkouitz was\nlo8 Belohlavek, houever, told OPR that sexual offender registration “was a common occurrence” for enumerated\nstate crimes, but the state crime charged in the state indictment against Epstein was not one of them.\nl9 The email does not indicate what the parties meant by “the agreement.”\n\n66\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l266\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021274.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON loo. 3536o38, Pagelo2 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page loo of 348\nand had added language waiving the preparation of a presentence investigation (PSI) “so he can\nkeep all of his information confidential. I have already told Jay that the PSI language . . . was\nunacceptable to our office.” Of even greater significance, in a follou-up email, Villafafia noted\nthat the defense had removed both the requirement that Epstein plead to a registrable offense and\nthe entire provision relating to monetary damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn the afternoon, Villafafia circulated her oun proposed “hybrid” plea agreement, first\ninternally to the management team with a note stating that it “contains the l8/l2 split that Jay and\nAndy agreed to,” and then to Lefkouitz. Regarding the prosecution of other individuals, she\nincluded the follouing provision: ‘This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability of the\ndefendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal\nconduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement,” including\nbut not limited to the conspiracy to solicit minors to engage in prostitution.\n\nIn her email to Lefkouitz, transmiting the plea agreement, Villafafia wrote:\n\nCould you share the atached draft with your colleagues. It is in\nkeeping with what Andy communicated to me was the operative\n“deal.” The U.S. Atorney hasn’t had a chance to review all of the\nlanguage, but he agrees with it in principle.\n\n[The West Palm Beach manager] and I will both be available at 2:oo.\n...

Acosta replied, “I don’t think I should be part of negotiations. I’d rather leave it to you\nif that’s ok.” Acosta told OPR that “absent truly exceptional circumstances,” he believed it was\nimportant for him “to not get involved” in negotiations, and added, “You can meet, like I did in\nSeptember, [to] reaffirm the position of the office, [and] back your AUSA, but ultimately, I think\nyour trial lawyer needs discretion to do their job.” Villafafia told OPR, houever, that she did not\nunderstand Acosta to be giving her discretion to conduct the negotiations as she saw fit; rather, she\nbelieved Acosta did not want to engage in face-to-face negotiations because “he wanted to have\nan appearance of having sort of an arm’s length from the deal.”\"'? Villafafia replied to Acosta’s\n9 As noted throughout the Report, Villafafia’s interpretation of her supervisors’ motivations for their actions\noften differed from the supervisors’ explanations for their actions. Because it involved subjective interpretations of\nindividuals’ motivations, OPR does not reach conclusions regarding the subjects’ differing views but includes them\nas an indication of the communication issues that hindered the prosecution team.

My caveat is that in the middle of negotiations, u try to avoid[] undermining my\nstaff by allouing ‘interlocutor[]y’ appeals so to speak so ’d want [M]arie on the call[.] [Pll have\nher set something up.”\n\nVillafafia sent to Lefkouitz her oun revised NPA, telling him it was her “atempt at\ncombining our thoughts,” but it had not “been approved by the office yet.” She inserted solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, a registrable offense, as the charge to which Epstein would\nplead guilty; proposed a joint recommendation for a 3o-month sentence, divided into l8 months\nin the county jail and l2 months of community control; and amended the § 2255 provision.’\nVillafafia’s revision retained the provision suspending the investigation and holding all legal\nprocess in abeyance, and she incorporated the non-prosecution provision while slightly altering it\nto apply to “any potential co-conspirator of Epstein, including” the four named assistants, and\ndeleting mention of the corporate entity employees. Finally, Villafafia deleted mention of\nimmigration proceedings, but advised in her transmital email that “we have not and don’t plan to\nask immigration” proceedings to be initiated. l”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia alerted Lourie (who had arrived in Florida from Washington, D.C.\nearly that afternoon) and the new West Palm Beach manager (copying her first-line supervisor and\nco-counsel) that she had included language that defense counsel had requested “regarding\npromises not to prosecute other people,” and commented, “I don’t think it hurts us.” There is no\ndocumentation that Lourie, the West Palm Beach manager, or anyone else expressed disagreement\nwith Villafafia’s assessment. Rather, within a few minutes, Villafafia re-sent her email, adding\nthat defense counsel was persisting in including an immigration waiver in the agreement, to which\nLourie responded, “No way. We don’t put that sort of thing in aplea agreement.” Villafafia replied\nto Lourie, indicating she would pass that along to defense counsel and adding, “Any other\nthoughts?” When Lourie gave no further response, Villafafia informed defense counsel that Lourie\nhad rejected the proposed immigration language.\n\nOPR questioned the subjects about the USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Lourie did not recall why the USAO agreed to it, but he speculated that he left\nthat provision in the NPA because he believed at the time that it benefited the government in some\nway. In particular, Lourie conjectured that the promise not to prosecute “any potential\nco-conspirators” protected victims who had recruited others and thus potentially were\nco-conspirators in Epstein’s scheme. Lourie also told OPR, “I bet the answer was that we weren’t\ngoing to charge” Epstein’s accomplices, because Acosta “didn’t really want to charge Epstein” in\nl3 Villafafia noted that she had consulted with a USAO employee who was a “former corporate counsel from a\nhospital” about the § 2255 language, and thought that the revised language “addresses the concern about having an\nunlimited number of claimed victims, without me trying to bind girls who I do not represent.”\n\na Villafafia gave OPR an <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> similar to that given by the case agents—that an ICE Special Agent had\nbeen involved in the early stages of the federal investigation of Epstein, and Villafafia believed the agent knew two of\nEpstein’s female assistants were foreign nationals and would have acted appropriately on that information. Villafafia\nalso said that the USAO generally did not get involved in immigration issues.\n8o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l28o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021343.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l69 3536o38, Pagel7l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l69 of 348\n\nnarrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.?’” The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?”°\n\n2. The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by Reasonable\n\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\n\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natorneys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at .. . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.7‘4 OPR also\n2l2 In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have joined with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021359.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ARS 3536o38, Pagel87 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l85 of 348\n\nThe meeting of USAO representatives and Epstein’s defense atorneys, together with the\nState Atorney and the lead state prosecutor on September l2, 2oo7, was a necessary part of the\nNPA negotiation process.\n\nEven after the NPA was signed, the defense continued to request meetings and reviews of\nthe case, both within the USAO and by the Department’s Criminal Division and the Deputy\nAtorney General. Although limited reviews were granted, during this period there was only one\nsubstantive meeting with Acosta, on December l4, 2oo7.7? This meeting occurred in lieu of the\nmeeting Starr had requested of Assistant Atorney General Fisher, most likely because the defense\nsubmissions to the Department’s Criminal Division had raised issues not previously raised with\nthe USAO and the Department determined that Acosta should address those in the first instance.7°?\nAcosta told OPR that he did not ask for the Department review, but he also did not want to appear\nas if he “fear[ed]” that review. Acosta’s nuanced position, houever, was not clear to the\nDepartment atorneys who responded to Epstein’s appeals and who perceived Acosta to be in favor\nof a Department review, rather than merely tolerant of it. Notably, though, none of those meetings\nor reviews resulted in the USAO abandoning the NPA, and Epstein gained no substantial\nadvantage from his continued entreaties.\n\nIn sum, in evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered the number of meetings, their\npurpose, the content of the discussions, and decisions made afterwards. OPR cannot say that the\nnumber of meetings, particularly those occurring before the NPA was signed, was so far outside\nthe norm—for a high profile case with skilled defense atorneys—that the quantity of meetings\nalone shous that the subjects were motivated by improper favoritism. In evaluating the subjects’\nconduct, OPR considered that the meetings were held with different levels of USAO managers and\nthat the explanations for the decisions to participate in the meetings reflected reasonable strategic\ngoals. Although OPR cannot rule out the possibility that because Acosta, Menchel, Lourie, or\nSloman knew or knew of the defense atorneys, they may have been willing to meet with them, it\nis also true that prosecutors routinely meet with defense atorneys, including those who are knoun\nto them and those who are not. Furthermore, meetings are more likely to occur in high profile\ncases involving defendants with the financial resources to hire skilled defense counsel who request\nmeetings at the highest levels of the USAO and the Department. Most significantly, OPR did not\nfind evidence supporting a conclusion that the meetings themselves resulted in any substantial\nbenefit to the defense. At each meeting, defense counsel strongly pressed the USAO—on factual,\nlegal, and policy grounds—to forgo its federal investigation and to return the mater to the state to\nproceed as it saw fit. The USAO never yielded on that point. Accordingly, OPR did not find\nevidence supporting a conclusion that Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia met with\ndefense counsel for the purpose of benefiting Epstein or that the meetings themselves caused\nAcosta or the other subjects to provide improper benefits to Epstein.\nane Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz is discussed separately in the follouing section.\n233 Starr and other defense atorneys only obtained one meeting at the Department level, with Deputy Assistant\nAtorney General Mandelker and CEOS Chief Oosterban in March 2oo8. Although Starr requested a meeting with\nAssistant Atorney General Fisher and another with Deputy Atorney General Filip, those requests were not granted.\n\nl59\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l359\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021365.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONO 3536o38, Pagel93 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9l of 348\n\nWith regard to her comment about “avoid[ing] the press,” Villafafia told OPR that her goal\nwas to protect the anonymity of the victims. She said that the case was far more likely to be\ncovered by the Palm Beach press, which had already writen articles about Epstein, than in Miami,\nand “if [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into the\ncourthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper.”\n\nIn evaluating the emails, OPR reviewed all the email exchanges between Villafafia, as well\nas Sloman and Acosta, and Lefkouitz and other defense counsel, including the portions redacted\nfrom the publicly released emails (except for a few to or from Acosta, copies of which OPR did\nnot locate in the USAO records). OPR also considered the emails in the broader context of\nVillafafia’s overall conduct during the federal investigation of Epstein. The documentary record,\nas well as witness and subject interviews, establishes that Villafafia consistently advocated in favor\nof prosecuting Epstein and worked for months touard that goal. She repeatedly pressed her\nsupervisors for permission to indict Epstein and made numerous efforts to expand the scope of the\ncase. She opposed meetings with the defense team, and nearly withdrew from the case because\nher supervisors agreed to those meetings. Villafafia objected to the decision to resolve the case\nthrough a guilty plea in state court, and she engaged in a lengthy and heated email exchange with\nMenchel about that subject. When she was assigned the task of creating an agreement to effect\nthat resolution, Villafafia fought hard during the ensuing negotiations to hold the USAO’s position\ndespite defense counsel’s aggressive tactics.\n\nOPR also considered statements of her supervisors regarding her interactions with defense\ncounsel. Sloman, in particular, told OPR that reports that Villafafia “was soft on Epstein. . .\ncouldn’t have been further from the truth.” Sloman added that Villafafia “did her best to implement\nthe decisions that were made and to hold Epstein accountable.” Lourie similarly told OPR that\nwhen he read the district court’s February 2ol9 opinion in the CVRA litigation and the emails\nfrom Villafafia cited in that opinion, he was “surprised to see hou nice she was to them. And she\nwinds up taking it on the chin for being so nice to them. When I knou the whole time she was the\none who wanted to go after him the most.” The AUSA who assisted Villafafia on the investigation\ntold OPR “everything that [Villafafia] did . . . was, as far as I could tell, [ ] completely pro\nprosecution.”\n\nBecause the emails in question were publicly disclosed without context and without other\ninformation shouing Villafafia’s consistent efforts to prosecute Epstein and to assist victims, a\npublic narrative developed that Villafafia colluded with defense counsel to benefit Epstein at the\nexpense of the victims. After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that\nnarrative to be inaccurate. The USAO’s and Villafafia’s interactions with the victims can be\ncriticized, as OPR does in several respects in this Report, but the evidence is clear that any missteps\nVillafafia may have made in her interactions with victims or their atorneys were not made for the\npurpose of silencing victims. Rather, the evidence shous that Villafafia, in particular, cared deeply\nabout Epstein’s victims. Before the NPA was signed, she raised to her supervisors the issue of\nconsulting with victims, and after the NPA was signed, she drafted leters to notify victims\nidentified in the federal investigation of the pending state plea proceeding and inviting them to\nappear. The draft leters led defense counsel to argue to Department management that Villafafia\nand Sloman commited professional misconduct by “threaten[ing] to send a highly improper and\nunusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” of the listed victims. Given the full context of Villafafia’s\nconduct throughout her tenure on the case, OPR concludes that her explanations for her emails are\n\nl65\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l365\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021409.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 335 3536o38, Page237 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 235 of 348\nDuring this meeting, the Agents did not explain that an agreement\nhad already been signed that precluded any prosecution of Epstein\nfor federal charges against me.

Ina leter to OPR, “Jane Doe #l4’s” atorney stated that although her client\nrecalled speaking with an FBI agent, she was not told about the NPA or informed that Epstein\nwould not face federal charges in exchange for his state court plea.\n\nAfter meeting with these three victims, the FBI case agent became concerned that, if\nEpstein breached the NPA and the case went to federal trial, the defense could use the victims’\nknouledge of the NPA’s monetary damages provision as a basis to impeach the victims.° The\ncase agent explained to OPR that she became “uncomfortable” talking to the victims about the\ndamages provision, and that as the lead investigator, “if we did end up going to trial... . [if]\nMr. Epstein breached this that I would be on the stand” testifying that “I told every one of these\ngirls that they could sue Mr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think\nit was right.”\n\nSimilarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “[T]hat’s why we went back to Marie [Villafafia]\nand said we’re not comfortable nou puting this out there... because. . . it’s likely that [the case\nagent] and I are going to have to take the stand if it went to trial, and this could be a problem.”\nVillafafia told OPR that the case agents were concerned they would be accused of “offering a bribe\n2o8 The case agent did not record any of the victim notifications in interview reports, because “it wasn’t an\ninterview of them, it was a notification. ...

Sloman\nresponded to Villafafia’s request with an email instructing her to “Hold the leter.”?\"” Sloman told\nOPR that he “wanted to push the [victim notification] leter out,” but his instruction to Villafafia\nwas “the product of me speaking to somebody,” although he could not be definitive as to whom.\nSloman further told OPR that once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO\n“had concerns that if we g[a]ve them the victim notification leter... and the deal fell apart, then\nthe victims would be instantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary\ncompensation.”\n\nOn December lo, 2oo7, Villafafia contacted the atorney who at the time represented the\nvictim who later became CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe #2” to inform him that she “was preparing\nvictim notification leters.” In her 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia noted\nthat she reached out to Jane Doe #2’s counsel, despite the fact that the USAO no longer considered\nAu8 The FBI case agent had emailed Villafafia the day before stating, “The leter that is currently being revised\nneeds to take into account that several victims have never been notified by your office or mine.” The case agent also\nstated, “I do not feel that [the defense] should have anything to do with the drafting or issuing of this leter.

USAO SUPERVISORS CONSIDER CVRA OBLIGATIONS IN AN UNRELATED\n\nMATTER AND IN LIGHT OF A NEW FIFTH CIRCUIT OPINION\n\nDuring the period after the NPA was signed, and before Epstein complied with the NPA\nby entering his state guilty pleas, the USAO supervisors were explicitly made aware of a conflict\nbetween the Department’s position that CVRA’s victims’ rights atached upon the filing of a\ncriminal charge and a new federal appellate ruling to the contrary. The contemporaneous\ncommunications confirm that in 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman were aware of the Department’s policy\nregarding the issue.\n\nUnrelated to the Epstein investigation, on April l8, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman received a\ncitizen complaint from an atorney who requested to meet with them regarding his belief that the\nFlorida Bar had violated his First Amendment rights. The atorney asserted that the CVRA\nguaranteed him “an absolute right to meet” with USAO officials because he believed that he was\nthe victim of a federal crime. Acosta forwarded the message to the USAO Appellate Division\nChief, who informed Acosta and Sloman that, according to the 2oo5 Guidelines, “our obligations\nunder [the CVRA] are not triggered until charges are filed.” On April 24, 2oo8, the Appellate\nDivision Chief emailed Acosta and Sloman, stating that she had “confirmed with DOJ that [her]\nreading of [the 2oo5 Guidelines] is correct and that our obligations under [the CVRA] are not\ntriggered until a case is filed.”°\n\nOn May 7, 2oo8, the Appellate Division Chief sent Acosta and Sloman a copy of a U.S.\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit opinion issued that day, In re Dean, holding that a victim’s\nae The forensic examination did not locate useful evidence on the memory cards.\n\n343 The Appellate Division Chief advised Acosta that Acosta could inform the complainant that, prior to the\ninitiation of charges, the investigating agency was responsible for carrying out the Department’s statutory obligations\nto the victim.\n228\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l428\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021531.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Pagelol of 2l7\nSA-355\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page 7 of 2l\n\ndeliberations.” Maxwell Reply Br. at 8.

Maxwell does not meaningfully engage\nwith Judge Nathan’s careful opinion, instead suggest-\ning that Juror 5o’s testimony at the hearing was “pa-\ntently absurd.” (Br.63).

Juror 5o testified as much at the hearing, provid-\ning a detailed narrative of why his errors were a fail-\nure of diligence as he rushed through the question-\nnaire while distracted. (A.333-34). Judge Nathan cred-\nited this <span class=\"highlight\">explanation</span> in light of his demeanor, which\nshe “closely observe[d]” as he testified, including dur-\ning his answers to questions “he appeared not to ex-\npect.” (A.333).

Juror 5o’s explanations were consistent\nwith “his sworn statements months earlier at oral voir\ndire” and his testimony that “his sexual abuse history\nwas not salient or [a] front-of mind consideration.”\n(Id.).

When an inmate\npresents with unique risk factors associated with individuals who have been charged with and/or convicted of a\nsex offense, careful evaluation is made with regard to housing these inmates with appropriate cellmates.\nMoving forward, a plan has been established to have a sign-in sheet and checklist at these meetings where\nhousing issues are addressed, indicating who was present and what the housing plan is for these inmates with\npsychological concerns. These checklists will be maintained in a binder by the Associate Warden of Programs.\nPlease see the atached checklist.\n\n4, Documentation Accuracy\n\nProfessional responsibility requires taking into account multiple descriptions of an incident as noted\n\nin your response.
