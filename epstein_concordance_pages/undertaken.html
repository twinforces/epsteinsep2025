Harvey, 869 F.2d l439, l443 (llth Cir. l989) (“Due\nprocess requires the government to adhere to the terms of any plea bargain or immunity\nagreement it makes.”). Indeed, even if this Court were somehou to set aside the Non-\nProsecution Agreement on the authority of the CVRA, and even if after consultation with\nPetitioners the United States determined that it would be proper and desirable to institute a\ncriminal prosecution in the Southern District of Florida against Epstein on the criminal charges\ncontemplated in the Non-Prosecution Agreement, the United States would still be\nconstitutionally required to adhere to the negotiated terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement.\nSee, e.g., Santobello, 4o4 U.S. at 262; Harvey, 869 F.2d at l443.\n\nDue process considerations further bar this Court from seting aside a non-prosecution\nagreement that grants contractual rights to a contracting party (Epstein) who has not been made a\nparty to the proceedings before the Court. See, e.g., School Dist. of City of Pontiac v. Secretary\nof U.S. Dept. of Educ., 584 F.3d 253, 3o3 (6th Cir. 2oo9) (“It is hornbook law that all parties to a\ncontract are necessary in an action challenging its validity ....”); Dawavendewa v.

See, e.g., Casale v. Tillman, 558 F.3d\nl258, l26o-6l (llth Cir. 2oo9); Pouell v.

See, e.g., United States v.

The lone case cited by the\ndefendant, Fierro v. Taylor, No. ll Civ. 8573, 2ol2 WL l3o4263o (S.D.N.Y. July 2, 2ol2), relied\nheavily on the statutory interpretation <span class=\"highlight\">undertaken</span> by two district courts in the District of South\nDakota, United States v. Bonestroo, No. ll Cr. 4ool6, 2ol2 WL l37o4 (D.S.D. Jan. 4, 2ol2), and\nUnited States v. Jungers, ll Cr. 4ool8, 2oll WL 6o46495 (D.S.D. Dec. 5, 2oll), both of which\nwere explicitly overruled by the Eighth Circuit decision in Jungers, 7o2 F.3d lo66. In the seven\nyears since Fierro has been decided, it does not appear to have been cited by a single other court.\nAdditionally, other cases in this Circuit and elsewhere have upheld convictions of procurers or\ncustomers. See United States v. O’Connor, 65o F.3d 839 (2d Cir. 2oll) (upholding convictions\nunder Section l59l of both the buyer and seller of a child); United States v.

Roberts, l74 F. App’s 475 (llth Cir. 2oo6) (in which defendant was convicted\nunder sections l59l(a) and l594(a) even though no actual children were involved)).\nCONCLUSION\nAs set forth above, the defendant’s proposed bail package is insufficient and insubstantial.\nPretrial Services, victims, and the Government all recommend pretrial detention due to the unusual\nand concerning confluence of factors in this case, including the defendant’s extraordinary wealth,\ndemonstrated willingness to interfere with victims and witnesses, continued possession of lewd\nphotographs of young females, and both the incentive and means to flee prosecution.\nVery truly yours,\nGEOFHREY S.

Oosterban assigned a CEOS Trial Atorney\nwho Villafafia understood was to review the case and prepare for trial in the event Epstein did not\n“consummate” the NPA. The CEOS Trial Atorney traveled to Florida to review the case\nmaterials, and to meet with Villafafia to discuss the case and interview some of the victims. After\none such meeting, Villafafia wrote to Acosta and Sloman:\n\nWe just finished interviewing three of the girls.

Sloman emailed Lefkouitz that CEOS was\n“ready to proceed immediately” with a review of the mater.

Lefkouitz argued that CVRA notification was not appropriate because\nthe Atorney General Guidelines defined “crime victim” as a person harmed as a result of an\noffense charged in federal district court, and Epstein had not been charged in federal court.\nNevertheless, Lefkouitz added that, despite their objection to CVRA notification, “[W]e do not\nobject (as we made clear in our leter last week) that some form of notice be given to the alleged\nvictims.” Lefkouitz requested both that the defense be given an opportunity to review any notice\nsent by the USAO, and that “any and all notices with respect to the alleged victims of state offenses\nshould be sent by the State Atorney rather than [the USAO],” and he agreed that the USAO\n“should defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding all maters with regard to those\nvictims and the state proceedings.”\n\nMonths later, in April 2oo8, Epstein’s atorneys complained in a leter to Mandelker that\nSloman and Villafafia commited professional misconduct by threatening to send a “highly\nimproper and unusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” victims.\n\nF. January — June 2oo8: While the Defense Presses Its Appeal to the Department\n\nin an Effort to Undo the NPA, the FBI and the USAO Continue Investigating\nEpstein\n\nAs described in Chapter Two of this Report, from the time the NPA was signed through\nthe end of June 2oo8, the defense employed various measures to delay, or avoid entirely,\nimplementation of the NPA. Ultimately, defense counsel’s advocacy resulted in the USAO’s\ndecision to have the federal case reviewed afresh. A review of the evidence was <span class=\"highlight\">undertaken</span> first\nby USAO Criminal Chief Robert Senior and then, briefly, by an experienced CEOS trial\natorney. A review of the case in light of the defense challenges was then conducted by CEOS\nChief Oosterban, in consultation with his staff and with Deputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal\nMandelker and Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher, and then by the Office of the Deputy\nAtorney General.

Acosta Asks CEOS to Review the Evidence\n\nNotwithstanding Senior’s favorable review, Acosta and Sloman told Starr and Lefkouitz\n\nthat they “‘appreciate[d]” that the defense wanted a “fresh face” to conduct a review, and noted that\nthe Criminal Chief had not <span class=\"highlight\">undertaken</span> the “in-depth work associated with the issues raised by the\ndefense.” They told the defense team that Acosta had asked CEOS to “come on board” and that\nCEOS Chief Oosterban would designate an atorney having “a national perspective” to conduct\na fresh review in light of the defense submissions. Oosterban assigned a CEOS Trial Atorney\nwho Villafafia understood was to review the case and prepare for trial in the event Epstein did not\n“consummate” the NPA. The CEOS Tnial Atorney traveled to Florida to review the case\nmaterials, and to meet with Villafafia to discuss the case and interview some of the victims. After\none such meeting, Villafafia wrote to Acosta and Sloman:\n\nWe just finished interviewing three of the girls. I wish you could\n\nhave been there to see hou much this has affected them.\n\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\n\ntwice within a 2o minute span. She regained her composure enough\n\nto continue a short time, but she said that she was having nightmares\n\nabout Epstein coming after her and she started to break doun again,\n\nso we stopped the interview.\n\nThe second girl . . . told us that she was very upset about the l8\n\nmonth deal she had read about in the paper. She said that l8 months\n\nwas nothing and that she had heard that the girls could get\n\nrestitution, but she would rather not get any money and have Epstein\n\nspend a significant time in jail.\n\nThese girls deserve so much beter than they have received so far,\n\nand I hate feeling that there is nothing I can do to help them. !*!\n\nThe CEOS Trial Atorney had substantial experience prosecuting child exploitation cases.\nShe told OPR that in her view, the victim witnesses in this case presented a number of challenges\nfor a prosecution: some of the victims did not want to admit they had sexual contact with Epstein;\nsome had recruited other victims to provide Epstein massages, and thus could have been charged\nas accomplices; some had “drug histories and . . . things like that”; some could appear to have been\n“complicit”; and there was no evidence of physical violence against the victims.

Sloman emailed Lefkouitz that CEOS was\n“ready to proceed immediately” with a review of the mater. Sloman advised Lefkouitz that “in\nthe event CEOS decides that a federal prosecution should not be <span class=\"highlight\">undertaken</span> against Mr. Epstein,\nthis Office will close its investigation,” but that, “should CEOS disagree with Mr. Epstein’s\nposition, Mr. Epstein shall have one week to abide by [the NPA].” Sloman forwarded this email\nto Villafafia, who responded, “Why would we possibly let him keep the same deal after all he has\nput us through? And after we have discovered 6 new girls... .”\n\nThe defense soon signaled that the CEOS review would not end Epstein’s requests for the\nDepartment’s involvement. On February 29, 2oo8, Lefkouitz requested a defense meeting with\nOosterban on March l2, 2oo8.'° Starr spoke to Assistant Atorney General Fisher and “made it\nclear that [the defense team would] want an audience with her if [CEOS] decid[ed] to support the\nprosecution.” On March 6, 2oo8, Acosta alerted Sloman and Oosterban that Starr and Lefkouitz\nhad called him to express “concern” about Oosterban’s participation in the case, and indicated\nthat “they may ask for more senior involvement.” Acosta “informed them that they certainly had\nthe right to ask whomever they wanted for whatever they thought appropriate, and that whatever\nprocess would be given them was up to whomever they asked.”\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz folloued up with Acosta in an email:\n\nWe appreciate that you will afford us as much time as Main Justice\n\ndetermines is appropriate for it to conduct a review of this mater.\n\nAs you have suggested, we will initiate that review process with\n\nDrew Oosterban, and engage in a discussion with him about all of\n\nthe facts and circumstances, as well as the legal and policy issues\n\nassociated with this case... .

Lefkouitz argued that CVRA notification was not appropriate because\nthe Atorney General Guidelines defined “crime victim” as a person harmed as a result of an\noffense charged in federal district court, and Epstein had not been charged in federal court.\nNevertheless, Lefkouitz added that, despite their objection to CVRA notification, “[W]e do not\nobject (as we made clear in our leter last week) that some form of notice be given to the alleged\nvictims.” Lefkouitz requested both that the defense be given an opportunity to review any notice\nsent by the USAO, and that “any and all notices with respect to the alleged victims of state offenses\nshould be sent by the State Atorney rather than [the USAO],” and he agreed that the USAO\n“should defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding all maters with regard to those\nvictims and the state proceedings.”\n\nMonths later, in April 2oo8, Epstein’s atorneys complained in a leter to Mandelker that\nSloman and Villafafia commited professional misconduct by threatening to send a “highly\nimproper and unusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” victims.\n\nF. January — June 2oo8: While the Defense Presses Its Appeal to the Department\n\nin an Effort to Undo the NPA, the FBI and the USAO Continue Investigating\nEpstein\n\nAs described in Chapter Two of this Report, from the time the NPA was signed through\nthe end of June 2oo8, the defense employed various measures to delay, or avoid entirely,\nimplementation of the NPA. Ultimately, defense counsel’s advocacy resulted in the USAO’s\ndecision to have the federal case reviewed afresh. A review of the evidence was <span class=\"highlight\">undertaken</span> first\nby USAO Criminal Chief Robert Senior and then, briefly, by an experienced CEOS trial\natorney. A review of the case in light of the defense challenges was then conducted by CEOS\nChief Oosterban, in consultation with his staff and with Deputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal\nMandelker and Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher, and then by the Office of the Deputy\nAtorney General. Each review took weeks and delayed Epstein’s entry of his state guilty plea.\n\nAs set forth belou, during that time, Villafafia and the FBI continued investigating and\nworking touard potential federal charges.\n\nl. Villafafia Prepares to Contact Victims in Anticipation That Epstein\nWill Breach the NPA\n\nOn January 3, 2oo8, the local newspaper reported that Epstein’s plea conference in state\ncourt, at that point set for early January, had been rescheduled to March 2oo8, at which time he\nwould plead guilty to felony solicitation of prostitution, and that “in exchange” for the guilty plea,\n324 The 2ooo Guidelines were superseded by the 2oo5 Guidelines.\n\n22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4544\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004887.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 75 of 8o\nenforcement of the non-prosecution agreement with the police. This Court found that the\nnon-prosecution agreement was invalid, because the police did not have the authority to\nmake it. Only a prosecutor holds that pouer. /d.\n\nWe recognized that what befell the Stipetiches may have been “fundamentally\nunfair,” particularly if their discussions with the police produced additional evidence of\ncriminality, including possibly self-incriminating statements. /d. at l296. In dicta, we\nsuggested that the remedy might be to suppress the evidence or statements that were\nobtained after the police purported to bind the Commonwealth in a non-prosecution\nagreement. /d.\n\nThis remedy is insufficient here, for a number of reasons. First, as noted, the\nremedy statement was dicta, and is not the law in Pennsylvania. Second, the\ncircumstances that led to the suggestion of that remedy are markedly different than those\nthat occurred in the present case. In Stipetich, the agreement was formulated with\narresting officers, who lacked the authority to make the promise not to prosecute. Here,\nconversely, the non-prosecution decision was made by the elected District Atorney of\nMontgomery County, whose public announcement of that decision was fully within his\nauthority, and was objectively worthy of reasonable reliance. Finally, a one-size-fits-all\nremedy does not comport with the individualized due process inquiry that must be\n<span class=\"highlight\">undertaken</span>. As outlined above, a court must ascertain, contemplating the individual\ncircumstances of each case, the remedy that accords with the due process of law. In\nsome instances, suppression of evidence may be an adequate remedy; in others, only\nspecific enforcement will suffice.\n\nHere, only full enforcement of the decision not to prosecute can satisfy the\nfundamental demands of due process.

Applicable Law\n\nIt is axiomatic that the Government may offer proof of acts included within the indictment.\nThose are the very acts the Government seeks to prove at trial. See United States v. Dugue, 763\nF. App’x 93, 94 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (summary order) (“[A]n act that is alleged to have been done in\nfurtherance of the alleged conspiracy is not an ‘other’ act within the meaning of Rule 4o4(b);\nrather, it is part of the very act charged.” (alterations and citation omited)); Quinones, 5ll F.3d at\n3o8 (“While Rule 4o4(b) identifies various rationales . . . for which evidence of bad acts other than\nthose charged in the indictment may be admited at trial, the rule has no bearing on the admissibility\nof acts that are part of the charged crime.” (emphasis in original) (footnote omited)).\n\nAs discussed above, see supra Section II, direct evidence is “not confined to that which\ndirectly establishes an element of the crime.” Gonzalez, llo F.3d at 942, see id. at 942 (rejecting\na claim that the evidence fell under Rule 4o4(b)). It also includes actions or statements that (a)\n“arose out of the same transaction or series of transactions as the charged offense,” (b) are\n“inextricably intertwined with the evidence regarding the charged offense,” or (c) are “necessary\nto complete the story of the crime on trial.” Carboni, 2o4 F.3d at 44.\n\nIn addition, in a conspiracy case, “the Government need not set out with precision each and\nevery act in furtherance of the conspiracy.” United States v. LaSpina, 299 F.3d l65, l82 (2d Cir.\n2oo2) (citation, alterations, and internal quotation marks omited). Instead, “where the\nGovernment must prove a conspiracy existed, evidence of acts commited in furtherance of the\nconspiracy is... direct evidence of the acts charged in the Indictment.” United States v.

It is also direct evidence of the operation\nof the conspiracy that is probative of the defendant’s intent at the time of the offense. See Op. &\nOrder at lo, Dkt. No. lo6 (“[I]t is anticipated that the three witnesses will provide detailed and\ncorroborating accounts of the Defendant’s alleged role in enticing minors to engage in sex acts.”);\nsee also United States v.

Accuser 3 is\nalleged, in the Indictment, to have had contact with Jeffrey Epstein between 2ool and 2oo4,\neC\nes .\n\nThe Government has listed a series of exhibits allegedly obtained during an October 2oo5\nsearch of Epstein’s Palm Beach residence, 358 El Brillo Way. The Court should prohibit the\nintroduction of any item seized during the search because of serious questions about hou and\nwhere the evidence was maintained, the lack of any authenticating witness, and the lack of\nrelevance to the charges against Ms. Maxwell.\n\nI. The Palm Beach Investigation\n\nMs. Maxwell was never a target or focus of any investigation <span class=\"highlight\">undertaken</span> by the Palm\nBeach Police Department, ever. Not one of the witnesses contacted during the investigation\nidentified Ms. Maxwell as a person who recruited them, had contact with them, or instructed\nthem to do anything with Epstein.\n\nThe reports from the Palm Beach Police Department reflect that Officer\nreceived an anonymous complaint about an unidentified male on March l4, 2oo5.

Applicable Law\n\nIt is axiomatic that the Government may offer proof of acts included within the indictment.\nThose are the very acts the Government seeks to prove at trial. See United States v. Dugue, 763\nF. App’x 93, 94 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (summary order) (“[A]n act that is alleged to have been done in\nfurtherance of the alleged conspiracy is not an ‘other’ act within the meaning of Rule 4o4(b);\nrather, it is part of the very act charged.” (alterations and citation omited)); Quinones, 5ll F.3d at\n3o8 (“While Rule 4o4(b) identifies various rationales . . . for which evidence of bad acts other than\nthose charged in the indictment may be admited at trial, the rule has no bearing on the admissibility\nof acts that are part of the charged crime.” (emphasis in original) (footnote omited)).\n\nAs discussed above, see supra Section II, direct evidence is “not confined to that which\ndirectly establishes an element of the crime.” Gonzalez, llo F.3d at 942, see id. at 942 (rejecting\na claim that the evidence fell under Rule 4o4(b)). It also includes actions or statements that (a)\n“arose out of the same transaction or series of transactions as the charged offense,” (b) are\n“inextricably intertwined with the evidence regarding the charged offense,” or (c) are “necessary\nto complete the story of the crime on trial.” Carboni, 2o4 F.3d at 44.\n\nIn addition, in a conspiracy case, “the Government need not set out with precision each and\nevery act in furtherance of the conspiracy.” United States v. LaSpina, 299 F.3d l65, l82 (2d Cir.\n2oo2) (citation, alterations, and internal quotation marks omited). Instead, “where the\nGovernment must prove a conspiracy existed, evidence of acts commited in furtherance of the\nconspiracy is... direct evidence of the acts charged in the Indictment.” United States v. Tounsend,\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6753\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006755.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 47 of 84\ncorroborative of the accounts of the other Minor Victims. It is also direct evidence of the operation\nof the conspiracy that is probative of the defendant’s intent at the time of the offense. See Op. &\nOrder at lo, Dkt. No. lo6 (“[I]t is anticipated that the three witnesses will provide detailed and\ncorroborating accounts of the Defendant’s alleged role in enticing minors to engage in sex acts.”);\nsee also United States v. Curley, 639 F.3d 5o, 59 (2d Cir. 2oll) (explaining in an interstate stalking\ncase that evidence of earlier abuse that was “similar in nature and severity” demonstrated a “patern\nof activity that was probative of [the defendant’s] intent’).\n\nMinor Victim-3’s testimony is also direct evidence of the offense because it concerns acts\ntaken by the defendant in furtherance of the conspiracies. In particular, ee\nee\nAccordingly, the defendant atempted to recruit additional victims through Minor Victim-3.\n\nIndeed, at a minimum, the defense motion should be denied because the Government’s\nproffered evidence relating to Minor Victim-3 is admissible to prove the overt acts involving\nMinor Victim-3 contained in the Indictment. (Indictment ¥J| l3(d), l9(d)). Evidence proving overt\nacts in the Indictment is direct evidence of the offense, and not other-acts evidence. See United\nStates v. James, 52o F. App’x 4l, 45 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (summary order) (“James’s possession of five\npounds of marijuana on December 22, 2oo5, and December 2, 2olo, were charged as overt acts in\nthe indictment. Accordingly, evidence of James’s possession of marijuana on these occasions was\nnot subject to the structures of Rule 4o4(b).”).

United States v. Napolitano, 552\nF. Supp. 465, 48o (S.D.N.Y. l982). The indictment does not allege that the alleged victim\ntraveled in interstate commerce or was underage during sexual encounters with Epstein.

Maxwell may renew her motion\nthen.\n\nVII. Maxwell’s motion to dismiss multiplicitous charges is premature\n\nMaxwell’s motion to dismiss either the first or third count of the Sl superseding\nindictment as multiplicitous is also premature. Maxwell contends that the Government has\nalleged the same conspiracy twice in the indictment. “An indictment is multiplicitous when it\ncharges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in separate counts, when, in law and fact,\nonly one crime has been commited.” United States v. Chacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45 (2d Cir. l999).\n“The multiplicity doctrine is based upon the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment,\nwhich assures that the court does not exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple\npunishments for the same offense.” United States v. Nakashian, 82o F.2d 549, 552 (2d Cir. l987)\n(cleaned up).\n\n“Where there has been no prior conviction or acquital, the Double Jeopardy Clause does\nnot protect against simultaneous prosecutions for the same offense, so long as no more than one\npunishment is eventually imposed.” United States v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir.\n2oo6). “Since Josephberg, courts in this Circuit have routinely denied pre-trial motions to\ndismiss potentially multiplicitous counts as premature.” United States v.

Sloman emailed Lefkouitz that CEOS was\n“ready to proceed immediately” with a review of the mater.

Lefkouitz argued that CVRA notification was not appropriate because\nthe Atorney General Guidelines defined “crime victim” as a person harmed as a result of an\noffense charged in federal district court, and Epstein had not been charged in federal court.\nNevertheless, Lefkouitz added that, despite their objection to CVRA notification, “[W]e do not\nobject (as we made clear in our leter last week) that some form of notice be given to the alleged\nvictims.” Lefkouitz requested both that the defense be given an opportunity to review any notice\nsent by the USAO, and that “any and all notices with respect to the alleged victims of state offenses\nshould be sent by the State Atorney rather than [the USAO],” and he agreed that the USAO\n“should defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding all maters with regard to those\nvictims and the state proceedings.”\n\nMonths later, in April 2oo8, Epstein’s atorneys complained in a leter to Mandelker that\nSloman and Villafafia commited professional misconduct by threatening to send a “highly\nimproper and unusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” victims.\n\nF. January — June 2oo8: While the Defense Presses Its Appeal to the Department\n\nin an Effort to Undo the NPA, the FBI and the USAO Continue Investigating\nEpstein\n\nAs described in Chapter Two of this Report, from the time the NPA was signed through\nthe end of June 2oo8, the defense employed various measures to delay, or avoid entirely,\nimplementation of the NPA. Ultimately, defense counsel’s advocacy resulted in the USAO’s\ndecision to have the federal case reviewed afresh. A review of the evidence was <span class=\"highlight\">undertaken</span> first\nby USAO Criminal Chief Robert Senior and then, briefly, by an experienced CEOS trial\natorney. A review of the case in light of the defense challenges was then conducted by CEOS\nChief Oosterban, in consultation with his staff and with Deputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal\nMandelker and Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher, and then by the Office of the Deputy\nAtorney General. Each review took weeks and delayed Epstein’s entry of his state guilty plea.\n\nAs set forth belou, during that time, Villafafia and the FBI continued investigating and\nworking touard potential federal charges.\n\nl.

January — June 2oo8: While the Defense Presses Its Appeal to the Department\n\nin an Effort to Undo the NPA, the FBI and the USAO Continue Investigating\nEpstein\n\nAs described in Chapter Two of this Report, from the time the NPA was signed through\nthe end of June 2oo8, the defense employed various measures to delay, or avoid entirely,\nimplementation of the NPA. Ultimately, defense counsel’s advocacy resulted in the USAO’s\ndecision to have the federal case reviewed afresh. A review of the evidence was <span class=\"highlight\">undertaken</span> first\nby USAO Criminal Chief Robert Senior and then, briefly, by an experienced CEOS trial\natorney. A review of the case in light of the defense challenges was then conducted by CEOS\nChief Oosterban, in consultation with his staff and with Deputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal\nMandelker and Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher, and then by the Office of the Deputy\nAtorney General. Each review took weeks and delayed Epstein’s entry of his state guilty plea.\n\nAs set forth belou, during that time, Villafafia and the FBI continued investigating and\nworking touard potential federal charges.\n\nl. Villafaia Prepares to Contact Victims in Anticipation That Epstein\nWill Breach the NPA\n\nOn January 3, 2oo8, the local newspaper reported that Epstein’s plea conference in state\ncourt, at that point set for early January, had been rescheduled to March 2oo8, at which time he\nwould plead guilty to felony solicitation of prostitution, and that “in exchange” for the guilty plea,\n324 The 2ooo Guidelines were superseded by the 2oo5 Guidelines.\n\n22o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23258\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023449.jpg": "The Electronics Technician told the OIG that, throughout his tenure at MCC New York, the camera system\nwas subject to frequently recurring failures, particularly with respect to the DVR hard drives.”\nThe Warden, who assumed his responsibilities at MCC New York in May 2ol8, told the OIG he was generally\naware that there were problems with the security camera system throughout the institution. He further\nstated that efforts were <span class=\"highlight\">undertaken</span> to determine which cameras were working and which needed to be\nfixed, and that MCC New York officials intended to ultimately seek funding to replace the entire system.\nFederal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) records reflect that on September 6, 2ol8, the Warden submited a\nmemorandum to the BOP’s Northeast Regional Director to request $8oo,ooo in funding to replace the entire\ncamera system. The memorandum identified an estimated project start date of December l, 2ol8, and an\nestimated completion date of February 9, 2ol9. The BOP approved the funding request, and on\nSeptember 2l, 2ol8, a contract in the amount of $698,lo8.99 was awarded to Company l to provide various\nequipment for the project and associated labor. On September 24, 2ol8, a separate contract in the amount\nof $34,o89.28 was awarded to Company 2 to provide assorted networking equipment and wiring needed to\ninstall the camera system.\nAs the camera upgrade project was beginning, BOP officials recognized that MCC New York’s mechanical,\nelectrical, and plumbing systems were also in need of major repairs. MCC New York did not have enough\nqualified technicians on staff to complete both the camera installation and other repairs needed at the\nfacility, so beginning the week of March l7, 2ol9, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office arranged for\ntechnicians from other BOP institutions to conduct temporary duty (TDY) assignments at MCC New York to\nperform the work. During the course of the TDY rotations, work was not consistently conducted on the\ncamera upgrade because sometimes TDY staff assigned to the project were used to cover shortages at MCC\nNew York's custody posts, and sometimes there were not enough TDY volunteers who possessed the skills\nrequired to do the camera work.\nAt the time of Epstein’s death on August lo, 2ol9, the camera system upgrade had not been completed.\nImmediately follouing Epstein’s death, Company l officials arrived at MCC New York and installed the new\nrecording system within a couple of days, and recording functionality was restored using the existing\ncameras. The majority of the new cameras did not arrive at the facility until October 2ol9, and they were\ninstalled in stages as the wiring work was conducted. According to the Electronics Technician, as of\nAugust 2o2l, when the MCC closed, the wiring work had still not been fully completed.\nll. Discovery of Security Camera System Recording Issues in August 2ol9\nA. Discovery on August 8 of the DVR 2 Failure that Occurred on July 29\nAccording to forensic analysis conducted by the FBI after Epstein’s death, disk failures occurred in MCC\nNew York's DVR 2 system on July 29, 2ol9, which resulted in the system being unable to record. According\nto BOP records and OIG interviews, the BOP did not learn about the failure until August 8, 2ol9, when the\nSpecial Investigative Services (SIS) Lieutenant and Associate Warden l atempted to review recorded\nsurveillance video for a mater unrelated to Epstein. The SIS Lieutenant told the OIG she discovered that no\n* The Electronics Technician provided the OIG with copies of email messages and work orders that documented nine\ninstances between June 2ol7 and July 2ol9, in which actions were taken to address a problem with either the MCC\nNew York's cameras or the hard drives used to record video from the cameras.\n82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23449\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023464.jpg": "management failures at multiple levels within the BOP.*” Similar to the Bulger report, the numerous and\nserious transgressions that occurred in this mater came to light largely because they involved a high-profile\ninmate. The fact that serious deficiencies occurred in connection with high-profile inmates like Epstein and\nBulger is especially concerning given that the BOP would presumably take particular care in handling the\ncustody and care of such inmates.\nRegretably, the OIG has encountered similar issues on many other occasions. For example, the OIG has\ninvestigated numerous allegations related to the falsification of official BOP documentation concerning\ninmate counts and rounds, several of which have resulted in criminal prosecution. The OIG currently has\ntwo open investigations into allegations of falsified inmate count and round documentation, each involving\nan inmate death (by suicide and homicide) or escape from a BOP facility.\nThis investigation and review also revealed the direct impact of insufficient staffing levels on inmate safety.\nWitnesses repeatedly told the OIG that counts, rounds, cell searches, and other methods of inmate\naccountability were not <span class=\"highlight\">undertaken</span> because correctional staff were working multiple shifts—including one\nstaff member who worked 24-hours straight—and were tired and overwhelmed with other duties. As\ndiscussed in greater detail in our recommendations, the OIG has repeatedly found the need for BOP to\naddress staffing shortages. Most recently, in March 2o23, the OIG found that the coronavirus disease 2ol9\n(COVID-l9) pandemic exacerbated the effects of preexisting BOP medical and nonmedical staffing\nshortages, an issue the OIG has identified as a concern for the BOP since at least 2ol5.°°\nFurther, the OIG has repeatedly found that BOP personnel have not consistently been atentive to the needs\nof inmates at risk for suicide. In this investigation, that inatention manifested in the failure of MCC\nNew York staff and supervisors to ensure that Epstein was assigned a cellmate as required by the MCC\nNew York Psychology Department directive issued after the July 23, 2ol9 incident in which Epstein was\ndiscovered in his cell with an orange cloth around his neck. In a March 2o23 report, the OIG found that BOP\npsychology staff did not assess the suitability of single-cell assignments for five of the seven inmates who\ndied by suicide while in COVID-l9 quarantine units between March 2o2o and April 2o2l.°? The OIG’s 2ol7\nreport on the BOP’s use of restrictive housing for inmates with mental illness also noted that single-celling\nmay present risks to inmate mental health, and both of the recommendations from that report regarding\nthe use and oversight of single-celling remain open as of March 2o23.\nLastly, as discussed in greater detail in the conclusions and recommendations that follou, the persistent\ndeficiencies of the BOP’s security camera systems are well documented and long-standing.\n57 U.S. DOJ OIG, Investigation and Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Handling of the Transfer of Inmate James “Whitey”\nBulger, 23-oo7 (December 2o22).\n*8 U.S. DOJ OIG, Capstone Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Response to the Coronavirus Disease 2ol9 Pandemic,\nEvaluation and Inspections Division A-2o2o-oll (March 2o23) (Capstone Report).\n5° Capstone Report.\n6 U.S. DOJ OIG, Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Use of Restrictive Housing for Inmates with Mental Illness, Evaluation\nand Inspections Report l7-o5 (July 2ol7).\n\n97\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23464\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023468.tif": "shifts, and the Captain had oversight over all of the Lieutenants.®° The OIG found that the failure of these\nindividuals to adequately supervise SHU staff and ensure that a high-profile inmate who had recently been\non suicide watch and psychological observation had an appropriate cellmate constituted a job performance\nfailure.\n3. Failure to Have a Contingency Plan for Assigning Epstein a Cellmate\nAdditionally, the OIG found that the Warden's failure to have a back-up cellmate assignment for Epstein\nconstituted poor judgment. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that although he knew\nthat Epstein needed to be assigned another cellmate, SHU staff could not just put anyone in the cell with\nEpstein. The Warden confirmed this in his OIG interview, when he explained that he and BOP executive\nleadership selected Inmate 3 as Epstein’s cellmate follouing the events of July 23, 2ol9. The Warden told\nthe OIG that no inmates were pre-veted to serve as Epstein’s cellmate if Inmate 3 left MCC New York. ® The\nNortheast Regional Director, the Warden, and the Captain all told the OIG that if Inmate 3 had been\nremoved as Epstein’s cellmate, they would have had to review a new list of potential cellmate candidates to\nensure that Epstein was housed with an appropriate inmate. This selection process, which involved multiple\nsteps <span class=\"highlight\">undertaken</span> by high-level BOP management, would be difficult to accomplish in a short period of time\nand ultimately may have impeded SHU officers’ ability to house Epstein with a cell mate on August 9, 2ol9.\n4. Lack of Candor\nBOP policy requires that “[d]uring the course of an official investigation, employees are to cooperate fully by\nproviding all pertinent information they may have. Full cooperation requires truthfully responding\nto questions.””°\nAs discussed above, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told\nthe OIG that they notified supervisory personnel regarding the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate.\nBased on a lack of corroborating evidence for these assertions, the OIG found that they lacked candor in\ntheir OIG interviews in violation of BOP policy. Similarly, the OIG found that Noel lacked candor in violation\nof BOP policy when she said she did not knou that Epstein needed a cellmate or that his then-cellmate\nInmate 3 had been transferred out of the SHU.\nThe OIG also found that the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant lacked candor in her interview with the\nOIG in violation of BOP policy when she said she was not aware that Epstein was required to be housed with\nacellmate. Her statement is contradicted by the fact that she was one of the MCC New York staff members\nwho responded to the July 23, 2ol9 incident involving Epstein, which resulted in him being placed on suicide\nwatch and psychological observation; she was a recipient of the Psychology Department's July 3o, 2ol9\n6 The Senior Officer Specialist who served as the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant from 4 p.m. to lo p.m. on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, told the OIG that she was not aware of Epstein’s cell mate requirement. The OIG credited her account\nbecause she did not ordinarily work in or supervise the SHU and did not receive the Psychology Department's July 3o,\n2ol9 email regarding the need for Epstein to have an appropriate cellmate or the USMS August 8, 2ol9 email notifying\nthat Inmate 3 would be transferred to another facility the follouing day.\n6 Upon reviewing a draft of this report, the Warden told the OIG that there were no suitable backup cellmates\nfor Epstein.\n7° BOP Program Statement 342o.ll.\nlol\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23468\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023484.jpg": "OIG Official Draft Report: BOP’s Care, Custody, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at MCC New York,\nNew York\nJune 22, 2o23\nPage 3 of 3\nBOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation.\nRecommendation Four: The BOP should evaluate its methods of accounting for inmate\nwhereabouts and wellbeing and make changes as may be appropriate to improve those methods\nthrough policy, training, or other measures.\nBOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation.\nRecommendation Five: BOP policy should clarify what is required of a lieutenant when\nconducting a round.\nBOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation.\nRecommendation Six: The BOP should continue to develop and implement plans to address\nstaffing shortages at its prisons.\nBOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation.
