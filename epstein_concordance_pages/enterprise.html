Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage l3\n(2d Cir. 2olo) (“A plea agreement binds only the office of the United States Atorney for the\ndistrict in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates\na broader restriction.”) (citing United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985) (per\ncuriam)). Moreover, any references in an NPA to the “Government” or the “United States” do not\nabrogate these principles. Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672 (“[A] plea agreement whereby a federal\nprosecutor agrees that ‘the Government’ will dismiss counts of an indictment . . . might be thought\nto bar the United States from reprosecuting the dismissed charges in any judicial district unless the\nagreement expressly limits the scope of the agreement . . . . Houever, the law has evolved to the\ncontrary.”). “The mere use of the term ‘government’ in the plea agreement does not create an\naffirmative appearance that the agreement contemplated barring districts other than the particular\ndistrict entering into the agreement.” United States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88, l2o (2d Cir. l998)\n(citations and internal quotation marks omited); see also United States v. Broun, No. 99-l23o,\n2oo2 WL 34244994, at *2 (2d Cir. Apr. 26, 2oo2) (in analyzing an SDFL plea agreement,\nreiterating the holding of Annabi and noting that it applies “even if the plea agreement purports to\nbind ‘the Government” or the “United States”) (summary order); United States v. Bruno, l59 F.\nSupp. 3d 3ll, 32l (E.D.N.Y. 2ol6) (“The Court disagrees with Defendant’s argument that the\nphrase ‘United States’ shous an intent to bind all United States Atorney’s Offices. Rather, the\nplea agreement covers only Defendant’s liability in the SDFL.”). ®\nIn sum, this issue is a distraction that has litle relevance to the bail determination and does\nnothing to address the defendant’s risk of flight or mitigate the danger he poses to the community.\nB. The Defendant Wrongly Argues the Statute Does Not Apply to His Sex Trafficking\nNext, the defendant wrongly argues that the “principal conduct” giving rise to the charges\nis his payment of underage girls for sex acts, and that such conduct could not possibly fall under\nthe charged statutes. As the defendant implicitly concedes, Release Motion at l4, this is an issue\nfor a motion to dismiss. Nevertheless, the defendant’s argument is incorrect for two reasons.\nFirst, although the defendant undoubtedly participated on the demand side of the crime, he\nwas also instrumental on the supply side given his role in recruiting and causing others to recruit\nadditional victims. He organized, funded, and perpetuated a sex trafficking scheme in two states,\nincluding with co-conspirators. The fact that he did so for his oun eventual and frequent sexual\ngratification does not vitiate his role in enticing and recruiting victims, consistent with the elements\nof the offense with which he is charged. The defendant was the leader of a sex-trafficking\n<span class=\"highlight\">enterprise</span>, not a mere consumer.\n’ This analysis similarly extends to a non-prosecution agreement. See United States v. Laskou,\n688 F. Supp. 85l, 854 (E.D.N.Y. l988) (“Defendant’s argument, in effect, is that unless there is\nan explicit statement to the contrary, it is presumed that a non-prosecution agreement binds offices\nof the United States Atorney that are not parties to the agreement. This position is at odds with\nthe law in this Circuit, which presumes a narrou reading of the boundaries of a plea agreement\nunless a defendant can affirmatively establish that a more expansive interpretation was\ncontemplated.”) (citing Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672).\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo34l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000767.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 72 Filed o8/o5/25 Page 2of5\nBSF\nIt is obviously impossible for two people to conduct a decades-long sex-trafficking <span class=\"highlight\">enterprise</span>\ninvolving thousands of victims without other individuals who participated in and facilitated these\nunspeakable atrocities.\n\nThe recent controversy surrounding the Government’s decision to withhold information\nconceming Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes has largely ignored the victims’ perspective. Ms.\nFarmer is thankful for the Court’s invitations to state the victims’ positions, and supports the\nunsealing of the grand jury transcripts, as well as the accompanying grand jury exhibits, with\nredactions only as necessary to protect victims’ names, likenesses, and identifying information.\nTransparency is critical to justice, and the public has a legitimate interest in understanding the full\nscope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, particularly where those actions caused lasting harm to\nothers. While it was not the victims’ decision to seek disclosure of the grand jury transcripts alone\n(as opposed to the much larger volume of information available in the “more than 3oo gigabytes\nof data and physical evidence” in the Government’s possession that should be disclosed as well),\nthe instant motion for unsealing will help expose the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes.\n\nIn this case that involved a decades-long, systematic criminal scheme that shocked the\nconscience of the public, caused lasting harm to survivors, and raised credible concerns about the\nfailures of institutional accountability, there is an especially compelling interest in transparency.\nUnsealing the grand jury transcripts will illuminate the scope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s abuse,\nprovide additional insight into those who enabled his abuse, and bring light to hou these crimes\nwere investigated and prosecuted. While grand jury secrecy serves important purposes, it is not\nabsolute and under these circumstances the balance tilts in favor of disclosure.\n\nl. Given the Magnitude and Abhorrence of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s Crimes, the\n\nUnsealing of the Grand Jury Transcripts Is Appropriate.\n\nThe Second Circuit has recognized that there are special circumstances when the release\nof grand jury records is appropriate based on the courts’ supervisory authority over the grand juries\nthey empanel and that the trial court has “wide discretion ... in evaluating whether disclosure is\nappropriate.” Jn re Petition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2, lo4 (2d Cir. l997). In Craig, the Second\nCircuit outlined a non-exclusive list of factors that a trial court may consider when deciding\nwhether “special circumstances warrant the release of grand jury transcripts. /d. at lo6. We join\nthe Government’s arguments for unsealing under the Craig factors, Epstein Dkt No. 66, at 3-7.\nTwo factors warrant additional discussion in light of the victims’ position in favor of unsealing.\nor commutation of her sentence.

When evaluating Congress’s\nintent at step one of the Landgraf inquiry, the Second Circuit has considered both the text of the\nstatute and the legislative history. <span class=\"highlight\">Enterprise</span>, 39l F.3d at 4o6-o8. In this case, the amended\nversions of Section 3283 evince Congress’s express intent to extend the statute of limitations. The\ntext and history of Section 3283 firmly establish that, with each amendment of the statute of\nlimitations, Congress intended to repeal and replace the prior version of the statute and thereby\nextend the time to bring live charges of child sexual abuse.\n\nThe 2oo3 amendment, like the l994 version of the statute, specifically states that “[n]o\nstatute of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution” of a child sexual offense “shall\npreclude” prosecution of such offense during the life of the victim. l8 U.S.C. § 3283 (2oo3).\nClaims that were live in 2oo3 were, at the time, subject to the then-existing statute of limitations,\nwhich ran until the victims reached the age of 25. Whenever that statute of limitations ran, it would\n“otherwise preclude prosecution.” Instead, that statute of limitations was replaced by the 2oo3\namendment.\n\nThe Eighth and Ninth Circuits have both held that Congress intended to extend the statute\nof limitations for live claims of sexual abuse. In United States v. Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d 682 (8™ Cir.\n2oo5), the Eighth Circuit reasoned that “both the title and wording of § 35o9(k) indicate that\nCongress intended by it to extend the general statute of limitations. . . . § 35o9(k) was later\nrecodified at § 3283 and continued to extend the statute of limitations in child abuse cases.” Jd. at\n684 (citing United States v. Johns, l5 F.3d 74o, 743 (8th Cir. l994) (holding that an earlier version\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2989", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002994.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6o of 239\n773 F.3d l38, l45 (4th Cir. 2ol4) (“[A]pplying [an] extended limitations period to claims that\nwere unexpired at the time of its enactment does not give rise to an impermissible retroactive effect\nunder Landgraf.”’).\n\nThe Second Circuit has considered in three cases whether retroactive statutes of limitation\nare permissible under Landgraf. In Vernon v. Cassadaga Valley Cent. School Dist., the Second\nCircuit held that a new statute shortening the filing period for a civil claim applied retroactively.\nIn reaching that conclusion, the Court noted that “Landgraf and other cases countenance treating\nstatutes of limitations differently from statutory provisions that affect substantive rights,” because\nstatutes of limitations regulate secondary, and not primary conduct. Vernon, 49 F.3d. at 89o-9l.\nIn In re <span class=\"highlight\">Enterprise</span> Mortgage Acceptance Co., 39l F.3d 4ol (2d Cir. 2oo4), the Second Circuit\nheld that applying an extended statute of limitations retroactively created impermissible retroactive\neffects. Yet in that case, it was critical to the Court’s analysis that—unlike here—the statute\nrevived claims that were previously time-barred. /d. at 4lo (“In our view, the resurrection of\npreviously time-barred claims has an impermissible retroactive effect.”’).\n\nIn Weingarten, the Second Circuit considered, but did not ultimately reach, the issue of\nwhether Section 3283 applies retroactively.'® In discussing the second step of Landgraf, the Court\nobserved: “Courts have routinely recognized a difference between revoking a vested statute of\nlimitations defense and extending a filing period for live claims.” /d. at 57 (collecting cases).\nMoreover, in an opinion by Judge Learned Hand, the Second Circuit explained why extending an\nactive criminal statute of limitations does not offend any concept of fairness:\n\nCertainly it is one thing to revive a prosecution already dead, and\nanother to give it a longer lease of life. The question turns upon hou\n‘© The First Circuit has similarly considered this issue in the context of an ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claim and declined to reach the issue of whether Section 3283 applies retroactively. United\nStates v. Miller, 9ll F.3d 638, 644 (lst Cir. 2ol8).\n33\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2994", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002995.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6l of 239\n\nmuch violence is done to our instinctive feelings of justice and fair\n\nplay. For the state to assure a man that he has become safe from its\n\npursuit, and thereafter to withdraw its assurance, seems to most of\n\nus unfair and dishonest. But, while the chase is on, it does not shock\n\nus to have it extended beyond the time first set, or, if it does, the\n\nstake forgives it.\nFalter v. United States, 23 F.2d 42o, 425-26 (2d Cir. l928). The distinction between statutes that\nrevive expired prosecutions and those that extend existing limitations periods has deep roots in\nestablished jurisprudence. It is well-setled that the Ex Post Facto Clause prohibits laws that revive\ntime-barred prosecutions, but permits laws that retroactively extend limitations periods. Stogner\nv. California, 539 U.S. 6o7, 632 (2oo3) (holding that the Ex Post Facto Clause does not “prevent\nthe State from extending time limits for . . . prosecutions not yet time barred.”); United States v.\nMorgan, ll3 F.3d l23o, l997 WL 2687l2, at *7 (2d Cir. l997) (unpublished opinion) (“The long-\nstanding rule in this circuit is that Congress has the pouer to extend the period of limitations\nwithout running afoul of the ex post facto clause, provided the original period has not already\nrun.”’) (citing Falter, 23 F.3d at 425-26). And other circuits have emphasized this distinction in\nthe context of Section 3283. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d, at 922-25; Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d 685.\n\nRead together, the Second Circuit’s decisions in Weingarten, Vernon, <span class=\"highlight\">Enterprise</span>, and\nFalter establish that Congress may retroactively extend the limitations period for still-viable\nprosecutions. That is precisely what has occurred here, because the charges in the Indictment were\nstill timely when the 2oo3 amendment extended the limitations period. As a result, applying\nSection 3283 in this case does not create impermissible retroactive effects. Therefore, step two of\nLandgraf is satisfied, and Section 3283 applies retroactively.\n\nResisting this conclusion, the defendant asserts that, in the criminal context, Landgraf’s\nsecond step provides protections beyond the Ex Post Facto Clause. But that is not the law. See\nNader, 425 F.

Nader, 425 F. Supp. 3d 6l9 (E.D. Va. 2ol9). In\nNader, the court performed a Landgraf analysis in analyzing the retroactivity of the 2oo3\nAmendment, and it appears to be the only previous case in which Congress’ explicit rejection of\na retroactivity provision in the 2oo3 Amendment has even been mentioned. In Nader, houever,\nthe court noted the legislative history of the 2oo3 Amendment but held that only the ‘ext of the\namendment was relevant to step one of Landgraf. 425 F. Supp. 3d at 627 (finding legislative\nhistory arguments “misplaced within the first step of the Landgraf analysis, which asks only\nwhether the statute at issue contains ... language unequivocally delineating the time period to\nwhich it applies”).\n\nNader’s exclusion of legislative history from the Landgraf analysis‘ cannot be reconciled\nwith the Supreme Court’s applications of Landgraf—or, for that mater, with Landgraf itself.\nSee, e.g., Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 264 (considering legislative history); Martin v. Hadix, 527 U.S.\n343, 355-57 (l999) (examining “structure and legislative history” as part of first Landgraf step).\nAnd as the government acknouledges, “the Second Circuit has considered both the text of the\nstatute and the legislative history” at the first Landgraf step. Opp. 28 (citing Jn re <span class=\"highlight\">Enterprise</span>\nMortgage Acceptance Co., 39l F.3d 4ol, 4o6-o8 (2d Cir. 2oo4)). Thus, Nader is not persuasive\nauthority.\n\nIn short, no court has considered Congress’ explicit rejection of a retroactivity provision\nin performing a Landgraf analysis of the retroactivity of the 2oo3 Amendment. In fact, the\ngovernment cites only three cases that have analyzed the 2oo3 Amendment under Landgraf at\nall: the Second Circuit and First Circuit opinions in Weingarten and United States v. Miller, 9ll\nF.3d 638 (lst Cir. 2ol8), respectively, which were ineffective assistance of counsel cases and\n* Although the court in Nader explicitly characterized legislative history arguments as “misplaced” within step one\nof Landgraf, it also omited them from step two of its Landgraf analysis. Nader, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 627-32.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3663", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003666.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o6 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4 of 22\napply this time-honored presumption unless Congress has clearly manifested its intent to the\ncontrary.” Gentile, 235 F. Supp. 2d at 654 (quoting Hughes, 52o U.S. at 946 (emphasis added\nby court)).° The First Circuit, addressing the issue on an ineffective assistance of counsel of\nclaim (and thus not reaching a merits decision), issued a similar caution in the specific context of\nthe 2oo3 Amendment:\n\n[W]hen Congress has sounded an uncertain trumpet, a court ought to refrain from\n\napplying an enlarged criminal statute of limitations retrospectively. ... Seen in\n\nthis light, Toussie potentially alters the second step in the Landgraf approach.\n\nMiller, 9ll F.3d at 645.°\n\nBy contrast, the government cites only one case—Nader—in which a court has held that\nthe application of a criminal statute of limitations to pre-enactment conduct is permissible under\nthe second step of Landgraf. Like the government here, houever, the court in Nader offered no\npath to reconciling Landgraf with Toussie. Instead, it applied Landgraf, a civil case, in a manner\nthat interprets Toussie out of existence in the retroactivity context, without any suggestion from\nthe Supreme Court that it intended such an effect. The opinions in Miller and Gentile, in\nacknouledging the need to read Landgraf and Toussie in harmony, provide the correct legal\nframework for the application of the second step of Landgraf. This is particularly so in light of\nCongress’ explicit rejection of a retroactivity provision in the 2oo3 Amendment, a factor not\nconsidered in Miller and absent from Gentile.\n\nIn arguing that “Congress may retroactively extend the limitations period for still-viable\nprosecutions” (Opp. 34) (emphasis added), the government completely misses the point. There is\n° The government’s atempt to discredit Gentile on the ground that it relied in part on a pre-Landgraf opinion (Opp.\n36) rings hollou. The court made clear that it was applying Landgraf (in conjunction with Toussie and Hughes).\nGentile, 235 F. Supp. at 654-55.\n\n° For this reason, the Second Circuit’s applications of Landgraf in Vernon v. Cassadaga Valley Cent.

Ms.\nFarmer is thankful for the Court’s invitations to state the victims’ positions, and supports the\nunsealing of the grand jury transcripts, as well as the accompanying grand jury exhibits, with\nredactions only as necessary to protect victims’ names, likenesses, and identifying information.\nTransparency is critical to justice, and the public has a legitimate interest in understanding the full\nscope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, particularly where those actions caused lasting harm to\nothers. While it was not the victims’ decision to seek disclosure of the grand jury transcripts alone\n(as opposed to the much larger volume of information available in the “more than 3oo gigabytes\nof data and physical evidence” in the Government’s possession that should be disclosed as well),\nthe instant motion for unsealing will help expose the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes.\n\nIn this case that involved a decades-long, systematic criminal scheme that shocked the\nconscience of the public, caused lasting harm to survivors, and raised credible concerns about the\nfailures of institutional accountability, there is an especially compelling interest in transparency.\nUnsealing the grand jury transcripts will illuminate the scope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s abuse,\nprovide additional insight into those who enabled his abuse, and bring light to hou these crimes\nwere investigated and prosecuted. While grand jury secrecy serves important purposes, it is not\nabsolute and under these circumstances the balance tilts in favor of disclosure.\n\nl. Given the Magnitude and Abhorrence of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s Crimes, the\n\nUnsealing of the Grand Jury Transcripts Is Appropriate.\n\nThe Second Circuit has recognized that there are special circumstances when the release\nof grand jury records is appropriate based on the courts’ supervisory authority over the grand juries\nthey empanel and that the trial court has “wide discretion ... in evaluating whether disclosure is\nappropriate.” In re Petition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2, lo4 (2d Cir. l997).

The Public Interest\n\nPlaintiff argues that the public interest is best served by allouing her claims to proceed.\n(8/27/2o Glassman Ltr., at 5.) Specifically, she contends that the public benefits from civil\nlitigation when that litigation furnishes the public with information on the torts and crimes of a\nwrongdoer. (/d.) Plaintiff further contends that, as her lawsuit is the only civil case currently\nbeing litigated against Maxwell (as any others have been stayed or dismissed), “the continuation\nof this last remaining civil avenue can furnish the public with critical information as to defendant\nMaxwell’s well knoun criminal <span class=\"highlight\">enterprise</span>, hou it was operated and all those involved.” (/d.) It\nis a mischaracterization of this action, houever, to call it the “last remaining civil avenue” for\naddressing Maxwell’s alleged misconduct, as, to the extent other civil litigation against Maxwell\nhas been stayed, it has not been terminated — just as this action, if stayed, would not be ended.\nMoreover, as the Government argues, the public interest is also served by protecting the integrity\nof criminal proceedings. (See generally 9/4/2o Gov’t Ltr.) Should civil discovery proceed, there\nis a risk that the criminal prosecution could be impaired by the premature disclosure of the\ntestimony of various witnesses or could otherwise be prejudiced. (See id., at 3 (citing Johnson,\n2oo3 WL 2l664882, at *2).) On balance, this Court finds that this factor weighs in favor of\ngranting a stay.\n\nAccordingly, taking all of the relevant factors into account, this Court finds that Maxwell\nhas met her burden to shou that a stay of this action is warranted.\n\nC. The Case Should Be Stayed in Its Entirety.\n\nThe Co-Executors, Government, and Plaintiff all agree that, should this Court grant\nMaxwell’s request for a stay, the stay should apply to the case in its entirety.

Indeed, the entire premise of Landgraf is that certain statutes must be\npresumed (absent a clear statement from Congress) to apply only prospectively,\neven though retroactive application would be entirely constitutional:\n\nBut while the constitutional impediments to retroactive civil\n\nlegislation are nou modest, prospectivity remains the appropriate\n\ndefault rule. Because it accords with widely held intuitions about\n\nhou statutes ordinarily operate, a presumption against retroactivity\n\nwill generally coincide with legislative and public\n\nexpectations. Requiring clear intent assures that Congress itself has\n\naffirmatively considered the potential unfairness of retroactive\n\napplication and determined that it is an acceptable price *273 to pay\n\nfor the countervailing benefits.\nLandgraf, 5ll U.S. at 272-73 (emphasis in original; bold added). '! This view was\nechoed by no less a jurist than Judge Calabresi, who opined that “[Landgraf’s]\nanti-retroactivity presumption is triggered by statutes whose retroactive\napplication, while not the equivalent of criminal ex post facto, nevertheless would\n\"! Landgraf cannot be distinguished in this regard simply because it was a civil\ncase. Non-criminal statutes, like criminal statutes, can be unconstitutionally\nretroactive (i.e. under the Takings or Due Process Clauses), but the constitutional\nstandard is different from the Landgraf test. See E. Enterprises v. Apfel, 524 U.S.\n498 (l998). Conversely, some criminal statutes are presumed not to apply\nretroactively even though doing so would be perfectly constitutional.\n\n6o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll22", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021123.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page/6 of ll3\nrun afoul of ‘familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and setled\nexpectations.’” Thom v.

In Vernon v.\nCassadaga Valley Cent. Sch.

Most\nimportantly for this case, <span class=\"highlight\">Enterprise</span> indicated that an extension of the statute of\nlimitations may operate with impermissible retroactive effect when it applies to\npre-enactment conduct, regardless of whether or not it revives claims that are\naltogether time-barred.

In re Enter. Mort. Acceptance Co. Sec.\nLitig. (‘<span class=\"highlight\">Enterprise</span>’), 39l F.3d 4ol, 4o6-o8 (2d Cir.\n2oo4). Here, the text and history of Section 3283 estab-\nlish that Congress intended to extend the time to bring\ncharges of child sexual abuse in cases where the limi-\ntations period had not yet expired.\n\nPrior to 2oo3, any child sex abuse offense could be\nprosecuted until the victim reached the age of 25 years,\nat which point the statute of limitations then in effect\nwould bar prosecution. In the 2oo3 amendment, which\nwas titled, “No Statute of Limitations for Child Abduc-\ntion and Sex Crimes,” Pub. L. No. lo8-2l, § 2o2, ll7\nStat. 66o, Congress explicitly provided that “[n]o stat-\nute of limitations that would otherwise preclude pros-\necution for [such an offense] shall preclude such pros-\necution during the life of the child.” l8 U.S.C. § 32838\n(2oo3). The amendment draws no distinction between\npre-enactment and post-enactment conduct. Instead,\nas Judge Nathan explained, by stating that “no statute\nof limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecu-\ntion of these offenses will apply,” the amendment’s\n“plain language unambiguously requires that it apply\nto prosecutions for offenses commited before the date\nof enactment.” (A.l5l). Thus, the breadth of the text\nshous that Congress intended “to extend the ... stat-\nute of limitations,” even for pre-enactment conduct.\nUnited States v. Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d 682, 684 (8th Cir.\n2oo5) (reaching same conclusion as to § 3283’s prede-\ncessor based on similar “title and ... wording” of stat-\nute); cf. <span class=\"highlight\">Enterprise</span>, 39l F.3d at 4o7 (describing provi-\nsion that “no limitation shall terminate the period\nwithin which suit may be filed” as example of statute\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l694", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021698.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page5l of 93\n38\n\ncertain discrimination claims, and held that applying\nthe new statute in a case “filed after its enactment, but\narising out of events that predate its enactment,” is not\nimpermissibly retroactive under Landgraf. Id. at 889-\n9o. As the Court explained, “[t]he conduct to which the\nstatute of limitations applies is not the primary con-\nduct of the defendants, the alleged discrimination, but\nis instead the secondary conduct of the plaintiffs, the\nfiling of their suit.” Jd. at 89o. The 2oo3 amendment to\nSection 3283 likewise applies only to the secondary\nconduct of filing a criminal case; it does not apply to\nthe primary conduct of Maxwell’s child sexual abuse\nby, for example, modifying the elements of an offense\nto criminalize conduct that previously had not consti-\ntuted a crime. See id. at 89l (“Landgraf and other\ncases countenance treating statutes of limitations dif-\nferently from statutory provisions that affect substan-\ntive rights.”). Thus, like the new statute in Vernon, the\n2oo3 amendment “impaired no rights possessed by ei-\nther party, increased neither party’s liability, nor im-\nposed any new duties with respect to past transac-\ntions.” Id. at 89o.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Enterprise</span> does not alter this conclusion. There,\nthis Court considered whether an amended statute of\nlimitations operated to “revive already expired securi-\nties fraud claims.” <span class=\"highlight\">Enterprise</span>, 39l F.3d at 4o5. While\nacknouledging that under Vernon, “retroactive appli-\ncation of a revised statute of limitations generally does\nnot have an impermissible retroactive effect,” the\nCourt concluded that “the resurrection of previously\ntime-barred claims has an impermissible retroactive\neffect.” Id. at 4o9-lo (emphasis removed). <span class=\"highlight\">Enterprise</span>\nhas no application here, as the limitations period for\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l698", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021699.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page52 of 93\n39\n\nthe charges against Maxwell did not expire before the\nstatute of limitations was extended. Thus, unlike En-\nterprise, where resurrection of expired claims would\nhave “stripp[ed] [defendants] of a complete affirmative\ndefense they previously possessed,” id. at 4lo, here\nMaxwell never possessed that complete defense. Judge\nNathan correctly concluded that the 2oo3 amendment\naccordingly “did not deprive [Maxwell] of any vested\nrights.” (A.l53).\n\nTo be sure, this Court has observed that there may\nbe “colorable arguments” that “the logic of <span class=\"highlight\">Enterprise</span>\nextends to criminal cases where the defendant’s stat-\nute of limitations defense had not vested when the lim-\nitations period was extended” because the extension\n“increases the period of time during which a defend-\nant can be sued,’ thereby ‘increasing a defendant’s lia-\nbility for past conduct.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 57\n(quoting <span class=\"highlight\">Enterprise</span>, 39l F.3d at 4lo); see also United\nStates v. Miller, 9ll F.3d 638, 644-46 (lst Cir. 2ol8)\n(discussing potential defense arguments). But such a\nclaim runs headlong into “the vast weight of retroac-\ntivity decisions,” which recognize that “revoking a\nvested statute of limitations defense is different from\nretroactively extending the filing period for a still-via-\nble claim.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 57 (collecting\ncases).\n\nFor example, “in the criminal context, there is a\nconsensus that extending a limitations period before\nprosecution is time-barred does not run afoul of the Ex\nPost Facto Clause of the Constitution.” Cruz v.
