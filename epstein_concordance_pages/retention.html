The guards seized confidential documents from her, including documents she had previously received in legal\nmail delivered to the MDC and given to her by MDC staff. After seizing “highly confidential” documents (subject to a protective order\nthat your staff is not authorized to review) and work product, the guards began reading the documents and have not returned them to\nMs. Maxwell.\nAt no time did the guards, who were assiduously watching and filming the legal conference, bring any concern to my atention, so it is\nquite telling that you have been contacted when counsel are told that legal staff are unavailable during the weekend.\nNo documents were given to Ms.\nMaxwell for her <span class=\"highlight\">retention</span>. Demand is hereby made for an immediate identification of the documents you claim were not in Ms.\nMaxwell’s possession upon entering the legal visiting area in advance of the arrival of counsel, a list of all guards present during the\nvisit, and a copy of the video recording.\nPlease immediately return the confiscated legal documents to Ms. Maxwell. They are her documents, not mine. The confiscation of\nthese documents has deprived Ms. Maxwell of her time and seriously impaired her ability to review legal documents and prepare for\nan upcoming trial, adding to an already difficult situation.\nThis mater is being reported to the Court and legal action will be initiated.\nRegarding tomorrou- | have recieved l5 different confirmations and cancellations regarding the scheduled visit for tomorrou, which\nwill be atended by Ms. Saffian alone.\nlam sorting through these emails to determine what time period is permited for tomorrou’s visit.\nBobbi\nBOBBI C.

Nathan\nUnited States District Judge\nUnited States Courthouse\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nMDC Legal persists in falsely accusing Ms. Maxwell’s counsel of violating MDC\nBrooklyn’s legal visit procedures. This allegation is reckless, false, and defamatory. At no time\ndid counsel provide documents to Ms. Maxwell for her <span class=\"highlight\">retention</span> that did not originate from Ms.\nMaxwell. The April 29\" leter from MDC Legal states that \"supervisory staff...reviewed video\nsurveillance footage\" but notably does not state the contents of that video surveillance. The fact\nthat MDC Legal does not claim to have reviewed the video or report the contents of the video\nfootage speaks volumes.\n\nFurther and contrary to MDC’s leter, MDC staff did in fact “seize and retain” Ms.\nMaxwell’s confidential legal documents after the legal visit on April 24. While most of those\ndocuments were returned to Ms. Maxwell, other documents, which the MDC concedes were\n“confiscated,” were not returned to her but rather given to her counsel the next day. As\npreviously stated, documents returned to Ms. Maxwell’s counsel was “legal mail” which had\nbeen sent to Ms. Maxwell some time prior to April 24. Counsel did not bring those documents\ninto the facility.\n\nThe MDC admits, and flouts the fact, that guards read Ms. Maxwell’s confidential\nmaterials. This is no small mater. Ms. Maxwell is working tirelessly to review and discuss with\nher atorneys literally millions of pages of documents. Deterioration of her confidential\ncommunications with her atorneys does not produce a fair and just trial.\n\nWe press our request that the Court direct the MDC to provide Ms. Maxwell’s counsel\nwith a copy of the video recording.\n\nVery truly yours,\nBOBBI C.

After some time has passed, a\n\n3 person might be asked to remember the event or the events, to\n\n4 answer questions, to subject himself to an interview, to\n\n5 testify. These are acts of retrieval where somebody is trying\n6 to retrieve information about the event.\n\n7 And so nou we enter that third stage, which is the\n\n8 retrieval stage. So our job as researches in this field is to\n9 identify the psychological factors that come into play at each\nlo of these three stages that can affect the accuracy of what\n\nll somebody is telling you.\n\nl2 Q. Let me stop you for a second. When you were referring to\nl3 the acquisition stage, you mentioned an event. In the category\nl4 of event, is it just something that one sees or can it be that\nl5 something that one actually personally experiences or hears?\n\nl6 A. Well, first of all, it could be just -- it could be what\n\nl7 somebody sees and hears. It can be a robbery, for example,\n\nl8 which somebody is seeing something and maybe hearing some\n\nl9 conversation, but it might just be memory from a conversation\n2o or memory for some other experience that ends up being critical\n2l where you would like to knou what happened.\n22 Q. So one could actually be an observer or an actual\n23 participant or a hearer, someone who hears something in that\n24 acquisition stage?\n25 A. Yes. Sometimes people, for example, are crime victims and\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool398l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00013982.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 76l _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page l23 of 246 24l8\nLCGCmax4 Loftus — direct\n\nl sometimes they're witnesses, and they're not the victim\n\n2 themselves, but -—-\n\n3 Q. Nou, after the acquisition stage, is anything that happens\n4 after the event, whichever constitutes the event occurs,\n\na considered <span class=\"highlight\">retention</span> stage?\n\n6 A. Typically, yes. It's after the event is over, so we say,\n7 well, that's the <span class=\"highlight\">retention</span> stage. I don't mean to complicate\n8 things too much, but I think you can appreciate that actually\n9 there can be many acts of retrieval. So there can be a long\nlo <span class=\"highlight\">retention</span> interval peppered with different acts of retrieval.\nll But I used a simple diagram here to illustrate the three major\nl2 stages.\n\nl3 Q. Can you simply identify what separate acts of retrieval\n\nl4 would be.\n\nl5 A. So after some event, say, you knou, a robbery, sometimes\nl6 people might have a conversation with each other about what\n\nl7 they saw and then sometimes the police might come to the scene\nl8 and start asking questions about what did you see or what did\nl9 you hear, and then the person might go to a police station and\n2o maybe try to make an identification of somebody who might have\n2l been seen at the event, and then somebody may be interviewed\n22 many more times, may then testify at trial. That would be a\n23 standard situation in a legally relevant event.\n24 Q. Nou, in each of those retrieval examples you just gave,\n25 that is coming from an external source; correct?\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool3982\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00013984.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 76l Filed o8/lo/22 Page l25 of 246 242o\nLCGCmax4 Loftus — direct\n\nl Q. So in connection with the acquisition stage, there could be\n2 external factors that can affect acquisition?\n\n3 A. Yes.\n\n4 Q.

What you hold from the experience; correct?\n\nl2 A. Well -- so, time is passing. I mean, the event is geting\nl3 older and older, and some other things are important in this\n\nl4 <span class=\"highlight\">retention</span> stage, and one of those things is whether or not a\n\nl5 person is exposed to post-event suggestion. If there is\n\nl6 post-event suggestion, maybe a litle misinformation, it can\n\nl7 enter a witness's memory and cause a contamination, an\n\nl8 alteration, a distortion, or even a supplementation of memory,\nl9 and the longer that <span class=\"highlight\">retention</span> interval, the older -- the older\n2o the event is, the more susceptible people are to having\n2l post-event suggestion potentially contaminate their memory.\n22 Q. It's fair to say that one does not need any degree\n23 whatsoever to knou that memory can fade over time; correct?\n24 A. Correct -- I think, yeah, that's kind of a mater of common\n25 sense. But what's less a mater of common sense is that, as\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool3984\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014546.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page l46 of 257 298o\nLCKVMAX6 Summation - Ms. Menninger\n\nl We knou that the accusers talked to their lawyers; we\n2 knou that many talked to the media; we knou that they saw the\n\n3 media; we knou that they talked to other accusers; we knou that\n4 they all had at least a plan of recovering money through their\na lawsuits and the victims' compensation fund, and that works on\n6 your memories.\n\n7 She told you about the three different stages of\n\n8 memories, and that one thing that can happen is what's called\n\n9 autosuggestion. Basically, when people suggest things to\n\nlo themselves, and then they start to remember things and they\n\nll start to draw inferences, and then they start to feel as if\n\nl2 those things are actual memories.

The older a\n\nl9 memory gets, the more susceptible it is to post-event\n2o information. A litle bit can come in, the older the memory\n2l is, and it can cause a contamination or a distortion or a\n22 supplementation.

After some time has passed, a\n\n3 person might be asked to remember the event or the events, to\n\n4 answer questions, to subject himself to an interview, to\n\n5 testify. These are acts of retrieval where somebody is trying\n6 to retrieve information about the event.\n\n7 And so nou we enter that third stage, which is the\n\n8 retrieval stage. So our job as researches in this field is to\n9 identify the psychological factors that come into play at each\nlo of these three stages that can affect the accuracy of what\n\nll somebody is telling you.\n\nl2 Q. Let me stop you for a second. When you were referring to\nl3 the acquisition stage, you mentioned an event. In the category\nl4 of event, is it just something that one sees or can it be that\nl5 something that one actually personally experiences or hears?\n\nl6 A. Well, first of all, it could be just -- it could be what\n\nl7 somebody sees and hears. It can be a robbery, for example,\n\nl8 which somebody is seeing something and maybe hearing some\n\nl9 conversation, but it might just be memory from a conversation\n2o or memory for some other experience that ends up being critical\n2l where you would like to knou what happened.\n22 Q. So one could actually be an observer or an actual\n23 participant or a hearer, someone who hears something in that\n24 acquisition stage?\n25 A. Yes. Sometimes people, for example, are crime victims and\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool66o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016606.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 76l _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page l23 of 246 24l8\nLCGCmax4 Loftus — direct\n\nl sometimes they're witnesses, and they're not the victim\n\n2 themselves, but -—-\n\n3 Q. Nou, after the acquisition stage, is anything that happens\n4 after the event, whichever constitutes the event occurs,\n\na considered <span class=\"highlight\">retention</span> stage?\n\n6 A. Typically, yes. It's after the event is over, so we say,\n7 well, that's the <span class=\"highlight\">retention</span> stage. I don't mean to complicate\n8 things too much, but I think you can appreciate that actually\n9 there can be many acts of retrieval. So there can be a long\nlo <span class=\"highlight\">retention</span> interval peppered with different acts of retrieval.\nll But I used a simple diagram here to illustrate the three major\nl2 stages.\n\nl3 Q. Can you simply identify what separate acts of retrieval\n\nl4 would be.\n\nl5 A. So after some event, say, you knou, a robbery, sometimes\nl6 people might have a conversation with each other about what\n\nl7 they saw and then sometimes the police might come to the scene\nl8 and start asking questions about what did you see or what did\nl9 you hear, and then the person might go to a police station and\n2o maybe try to make an identification of somebody who might have\n2l been seen at the event, and then somebody may be interviewed\n22 many more times, may then testify at trial. That would be a\n23 standard situation in a legally relevant event.\n24 Q. Nou, in each of those retrieval examples you just gave,\n25 that is coming from an external source; correct?\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool66o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016608.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 76l Filed o8/lo/22 Page l25 of 246 242o\nLCGCmax4 Loftus — direct\n\nl Q. So in connection with the acquisition stage, there could be\n2 external factors that can affect acquisition?\n\n3 A. Yes.\n\n4 Q. And there could also be personal or internal factors that\n\n5 could affect one's acquisition of information?\n\n6 A. Yes.\n\n7 Q. Nou, going to the retrieval stage --\n\n8 A. <span class=\"highlight\">Retention</span>.\n\n9 QO. Well, <span class=\"highlight\">retention</span> would be --\n\nlo A. What would be next.\n\nll Q. What you hold from the experience; correct?\n\nl2 A. Well -- so, time is passing. I mean, the event is geting\nl3 older and older, and some other things are important in this\n\nl4 <span class=\"highlight\">retention</span> stage, and one of those things is whether or not a\n\nl5 person is exposed to post-event suggestion. If there is\n\nl6 post-event suggestion, maybe a litle misinformation, it can\n\nl7 enter a witness's memory and cause a contamination, an\n\nl8 alteration, a distortion, or even a supplementation of memory,\nl9 and the longer that <span class=\"highlight\">retention</span> interval, the older -- the older\n2o the event is, the more susceptible people are to having\n2l post-event suggestion potentially contaminate their memory.\n22 Q. It's fair to say that one does not need any degree\n23 whatsoever to knou that memory can fade over time; correct?\n24 A. Correct -- I think, yeah, that's kind of a mater of common\n25 sense. But what's less a mater of common sense is that, as\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool66o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017167.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page l46 of 257 298o\nLCKVMAX6 Summation - Ms. Menninger\n\nl We knou that the accusers talked to their lawyers; we\n2 knou that many talked to the media; we knou that they saw the\n\n3 media; we knou that they talked to other accusers; we knou that\n4 they all had at least a plan of recovering money through their\na lawsuits and the victims' compensation fund, and that works on\n6 your memories.\n\n7 She told you about the three different stages of\n\n8 memories, and that one thing that can happen is what's called\n\n9 autosuggestion. Basically, when people suggest things to\n\nlo themselves, and then they start to remember things and they\n\nll start to draw inferences, and then they start to feel as if\n\nl2 those things are actual memories. But memories come from the\nl3 acquisition of the event, the <span class=\"highlight\">retention</span> of the information, and\nl4 the retrieval. And post-event information can impact a memory\nl5 at any one of those stages.\n\nl6 If you're under the influence of drugs or alcohol at\nl7 the time you acquire the memory, that affects the quality of\n\nl8 the formation of the memory in the first place. The older a\n\nl9 memory gets, the more susceptible it is to post-event\n2o information. A litle bit can come in, the older the memory\n2l is, and it can cause a contamination or a distortion or a\n22 supplementation. And news media in whatever form can include\n23 re-dramatization.\n24 Sometimes there's pressure to provide more and more\n25 details about some particular subject. I don't knou.
