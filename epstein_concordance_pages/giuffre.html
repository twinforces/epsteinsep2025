Epstein, l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB\nDear Judge Berman:\nYesterday, I was provided a partial transcript of the August 27, 2ol9 hearing in the above-\ncaptioned case, and I am writing to clarify the record.\nAs you knou, I co-authored a New York Law Journal article before the hearing. The transcript\nquotes the court, in pertinent part, as follous with reference to me and the article: “On a somewhat more\nserious note, don’t quote me on this, but it is my understanding that one of the authors of that article is :\nhimself counsel in one of the Epstein-related cases.

Analyzing hou the Nolle Prosequi ([Epstein] ECF No. 52)\nfiled in this case impacts proposed disclosure, with legal\nauthorities.\n\n(Epstein Dkt. 67). In the Maxwell case, the Court directed the Government to provide additional\ninformation by August 4, 2o25, in particular, a leter:\n\nl. Stating whether the Government moves to unseal the grand\njury exhibits as well as the transcripts, or just the transcripts.\n\n2. Identifying with specificity the grand jury exhibits, as\nredacted for public release, that are not already part of the\npublic record. In making this assessment, the Government\nshould take into account whether the unredacted portions of\nthese exhibits were received in evidence during trial in this\ncase, otherwise disclosed on the docket of this case, or\ndisclosed in the course of civil litigation, see, e.g., <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> v.\nMaxwell, l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP).\n\n3. Identifying with specificity the information testified to in the\ngrand jury transcripts, as redacted for proposed release, that\nis not already part of the public record, taking into account\nthe sources above.\n\n(Maxwell Dkt. 797).\n\nBecause the Court’s Orders, and the information sought, are consistent in several respects,\nthe Government respectfully submits this consolidated leter response.\n\nFirst, at this time, the Government has moved only to unseal the grand jury transcripts in\nthese cases. Of course, the grand jury exhibits are not the only exhibits in these cases; a large\nnumber of exhibits were admited at the Maxwell trial, which trial exhibits are—subject to\njudicially approved redactions and/or sealing—presumptively public documents. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo49 (2d Cir. l995) (“the public has an especially strong right of\naccess to evidence introduced in trials” (internal quotation marks and citation omited)); United\nStates v. Akhavan, 532 F. Supp. 3d l8l, l86 (S.D.N.Y. 2o2l) (“trial exhibits are judicial\ndocuments to which an ‘especially strong’ common law presumption of access applies” (quoting\nAmodeo, 7l F.3d at lo49)). The Government previously made those trial exhibits—subject to any\njudicially approved redactions and/or sealing—available to the public through a website during\nthe Maxwell trial.\n\nThe Government respectfully requests leave of the Court to advise the Court by August 8,\n2o25, of its position with respect to unsealing of the grand jury exhibits. Such timing will permit\nthe Government to consider (with respect to its underlying position as well as with respect to any\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo762", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000769.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 72 Filed o8/o5/25 Page4of5\nBSF\naffirmatively support unsealing, subject to appropriate redactions to protect their personal privacy.\nTheir consent to disclosure should weigh in favor of unsealing under this factor. Further, because\nthe Government intends to redact the names and identifying information of the victims, there is no\nrisk that the privacy of the victims will be jeopardized. Jn re Kutler, 8oo F. Supp. 2d 42, 5o (D.D.C.\n2oll) (procedures for reviewing transcripts to protect named individuals as needed “allay any\nremaining privacy concerns”).\n2. The Court Should Assess the Appropriateness of the Redactions.\n\nThe grand jury transcripts should be released subject to narrouly tailored redactions of the\nnames, likenesses, and identifying information of the victims. The Court should not, houever,\nrubber stamp redactions to withhold from the public “information related to third parties who\nneither have been charged or alleged to be involved in the crimes with which Epstein and Maxwell\nwere charged,” Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 7. Any effort to redact third party names smacks of a cover\nup. The Government does not elaborate on what protocol it is using to redact other “third party”\nnames or which types of individuals it seeks to protect in this way. To the extent the Government\nfor some reason seeks to redact the names of other Epstein and Maxwell affiliates on the basis that\nthese individuals “neither have been charged or alleged to be involved” in their crimes, the Court\nshould exercise its independent authority to ensure that any redactions are tailored to serve\ncompelling interests. See generally Broun v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 4l, 5o (2d Cir. 2ol9) (even if\nmaterials are not considered judicial documents to which a presumption of public access applies,\n“a court must still articulate specific and substantial reasons for sealing such material’).\n\nA. Redactions of the Names and Identifying Information of the Victims Is\n\nAppropriate.\n\nThe privacy interests of Ms. Farmer and other victims (as victims of sex abuse and human\ntrafficking) are strong. In <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> v. Maxwell, Judge Preska repeatedly recognized the “gravity of\nthe privacy interests” of “victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse.” <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> v. Maxwell, 2o2o\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 22l599, at *l6 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o). The Court explained that “[t]hose\ninterests are particularly acute given that the psychological and emotional wellbeing of survivors\nof alleged sexual assaults may be implicated by such a broad disclosure.” <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> v. Dershouitz,\n2o2o WL 5439623, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 9, 2o2o). And “[t]hose interests weigh no less heavily”\nwhere “it is law enforcement seeking modification of the protective order instead of a private\nlitigant.” <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> v. Maxwell, 2o2o U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22l599, at *l6. In Doe J v. JP Morgan\nChase Bank, N.A., Judge Rakoff recently found that the privacy interest of a victim of Epstein\njustified sealing because “[p]rotecting the identity of sexual assault survivors and the details of\ntheir assaults is traditionally considered private and has been widely recognized as a compelling\nreason to limit public access to [even] judicial documents.” 742 F.

None of those facts are present here—by contrast, here, the\nIndictment particularly describes relevant time periods and events, including referring to the\ndefendant’s conversations with victims, interactions with victims, and specific relevant locations.*\n\nTo the extent the defendant is arguing that she cannot identify the nature of the charges\nagainst her, the proper vehicle for such an argument is a motion for a bill of particulars. Any such\nmotion can be made in December with all other motions and follouing the completion of\ndiscovery. While the Government anticipates opposing such a motion as baseless on the facts of\nthis case, the Government respectfully submits that in any event such a motion could not be\nmeaningfully evaluated at this stage, prior to the completion of discovery.

The Government is deeply concerned by the recent actions of the\ndefendant’s counsel who represent her in both this criminal mater as well as in certain civil\nmaters, and who in a recent public filing in a civil case referred to their receipt of sealed materials\nin discovery in this case. In particular, the defendant’s counsel publicly claimed in a civil filing\nthat they purportedly had received “critical new information” from the criminal case that it could\nnot disclose “because it is subject to a protective order in the Criminal Action,” and further noting\npublicly a desire to seek modification of the protective order in this case to use such materials in\nthe civil case, which the protective order expressly precludes.

P. 8(a) and l4, requests that the Court enter an\norder severing Counts Five and Six of the Superseding Indictment (“Indictment”) from Counts\nOne through Four because these Counts have been improperly joined and a joint trial would\nresult in substantial prejudice to Ms. Maxwell.\n\nCounts Five and Six of the Indictment allege that Ms. Maxwell made materially false\nstatements at two civil depositions in 2ol6 that were part of a defamation action brought against\nher more than twenty years after the conduct alleged in Counts One through Four supposedly\ntook place (l994-l997). The plaintiff in the defamation action, Virginia Roberts <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>, made\nwild and false accusations that she had been sexually trafficked by Epstein and Ms. Maxwell to\ndozens of famous politicians, professors, foreign leaders, and others. When Ms. Maxwell denied\nthese allegations as false, <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> sued for defamation. Discovery conducted in the defamation\naction established that <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s stories, sold to tabloids for large sums of money, were in fact\nfalse. Those accused by Ms. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>, Professor Alan Dershouitz, for example, denounced her as\na “serial liar.” Regardless, Ms. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> is not one of the three accusers identified in Counts One\nthrough Four of the Superseding Indictment and her claims relate to a different time period\nentirely. Allouing Counts Five and Six to be tried along with Counts One through Four will\nsignificantly prejudice Ms. Maxwell because it will allou the government to introduce testimony\nof alleged sexual abuse that purportedly occurred outside of the time period alleged in Counts\nOne through Four, despite the fact that Ms. Maxwell (unlike Jeffrey Epstein) was never\ncriminally charged with that conduct. As a result, the jury may convict Ms. Maxwell of Counts\nOne through Four based on an improper inference of criminal propensity.\n\nFurthermore, the Court and the jury and the Court will have to resolve numerous complex\nlegal and factual issues in connection with the perjury charges that will lengthen and complicate\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2283", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002288.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl2o Filed ol/25/2l Page lo of l9\n\nPrejudice sufficient to justify severance under Rule l4 may exist when: (l) the defendant\nmight become embarrassed or confounded in presenting separate defenses, (2) the jury might use\nevidence of one of the crimes charged to infer a criminal disposition to commit the other crime\nor crimes charged, or (3) the jury might cumulate evidence of the various crimes charged to find\nguilt on a count, which if considered separately, it would not so find.

The Perjury Counts Are Improperly Joined Under Rule 8(a) and Must Be\nSevered\n\nThe Perjury Counts (Counts Five and Six) were improperly joined and should be severed\nfrom the Mann Act Counts (Counts One through Four) as a mater of law. The Perjury Counts\nand the Mann Act Counts are entirely separate offenses that involve different time periods,\ndifferent alleged victims, and different substantive charges. The Mann Act Counts are confined,\npurposefully, to a very narrou time period and allege that Ms. Maxwell enticed and transported\nminors to engage in illegal sexual activity from l994 to l997. Indictment J 9, l3, l5, l9. The\nPerjury Counts allege that Ms. Maxwell purportedly made false statements in 2ol6 in a civil\ndefamation action that concerned allegations of purported sexual abuse in a later time period\n(l999-2oo2) for which Ms. Maxwell has never been charged criminally. /d. §f[ 2l, 23; Ex. A at\n3-5. The plaintiff in the defamation action, Virginia Roberts <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>, is not one of the three\naccusers referred to in the Mann Act Counts. Similarly, the people we believe to be the three\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2288", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002290.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl2o Filed ol/25/2l Page l2 of l9\nsubstantive crimes when the false declarations “concern the substantive offenses.” Potamitis,\n739 F.2d at 79l. Such cases typically involve situations where the defendant was aware that he\nwas being investigated and either lied to the grand jury or made false statements to law\nenforcement officers in an effort to thwart the existing investigation into the other offenses with\nwhich he was charged. See, e.g., id. at 789-9o (joinder of perjury, false statements, and\nobstruction of justice counts proper where defendant made false statements to FBI agents and\nperjured himself in the grand jury); see also id. at 79l (collecting cases).\n\nHere, the circumstances are very different and joinder is not appropriate. The\ngovernment does not allege that Ms. Maxwell lied to the grand jury or the FBI to derail its\ninvestigation into the conduct underlying the Mann Act Counts. Instead, it alleges that Ms.\nMaxwell made false statements in two depositions in an unrelated civil defamation action which\noccurred in April and July 2ol6. Moreover, although the government alleges that some of the\nquestions posed at the depositions related to some of the alleged victims in this case (Indictment\n{| 2, 8), the questions were tangential to the defamation action, which was based on Ms.\nMaxwell’s denial of a purported conspiracy with Epstein from l999-2oo2 involving Ms. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>.\nThe alleged false statements underlying the Perjury Counts therefore do not “concern” the Mann\nAct Counts and cannot be joined as part of a “common scheme or plan.” Potamitis, 739 F.2d at\n79l.\n\nThe government makes only a half-hearted, and ineffective, atempt to allege a\nconnection between the Perjury Counts and the Mann Act Counts sufficient to satisfy Rule 8(a).\nParagraph 2 of the Indictment alleges:\n\n[I]n an effort to conceal her crimes, MAXWELL repeatedly lied when questioned\n\nabout her conduct, including in relation to some of the minor victims described\n\nherein, when providing testimony under oath in 2ol6.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo229o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002291.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl2o Filed ol/25/2l Page l3 of l9\n(Indictment § 2; accord id. 4 8.) As discussed in Ms. Maxwell’s Memorandum in Support of her\nMotion to Dismiss Counts Five and Six, because the statements at issue are not perjurious, the\nquestions asked were confusing, ambiguous, and improperly formed. None of the questions, or\nany answers, were material to any issue in the defamation action. There were no “crimes”\nconcealed by Ms. Maxwell’s answers which were both true and reflective of the poor\nquestioning by the plaintiff's lawyers. The Government does not articulate hou statements like:\n“T don’t knou what you are talking about,” an admission that Ms. Maxwell “could not make a\nlist” upon demand, her lack of knouledge about undefined “devices” or “toys” could possibly\n“conceal her crimes.” Accordingly, the government’s purported connection between the Perjury\nCounts and the Mann Act Counts defies logic and is insufficient to permit joinder under Rule\n8(a). See Boti, 2oo9 WL 3l57582, at *5 (joinder improper due to “speculative nature of the\nlink” between structuring counts alleging false statements to IRS agent and separate corruption\ncounts); Mitan, 2oo9 WL 232887o, at *3 (joinder improper where alleged perjury arose from\nfalse statement in connection with defendant’s bail application, not an atempt to “cover up”\nunderlying scheme to defraud with which defendant was charged).\n\nB. The Perjury Counts Should Be Severed Under Rule l4(a) Because Their\n\nInclusion Will Substantially Prejudice Ms. Maxwell at Trial\n\nEven if the Court finds that joinder is proper under Rule 8, the Court should nevertheless\nexercise its discretion to sever Counts Five and Six under Rule l4(a) because of the substantial\nprejudice to Ms. Maxwell and these proceedings. A joint trial of the Perjury Counts will require\na full-bloun re-litigation of the defamation action, which will result in a collateral mater taking\nover the trial. Substantial amounts of evidence that would be inadmissible and irrelevant as to\nthe Mann Act Counts will, necessarily, be presented in order to prove the Perjury Counts. For\nexample, there will need to be a collateral trial on whether Virginia Roberts <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s statements\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR- oooo229l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002292.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl2o Filed ol/25/2l Page l4 of l9\nabout an alleged conspiracy from l999-2oo2 were in fact lies, even though the Mann Act Counts\nhave nothing to do with <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> and are based on an entirely separate time period. The jury will\nalso need to be instructed on the elements of civil defamation and the various defenses, and they\nwill need to evaluate whether the alleged perjurious statements were material to the defamation\naction. At the time the defamation case was dismissed, more than 5o substantive motions were\npending before the District Court. Resolution of the materiality question would necessarily\ninvolve adjudicating those motions. Accordingly, joining the Perjury Counts would substantially\nlengthen the trial and unnecessarily complicate the factual issues put before the jury; it would not\nserve the goals of trial efficiency and judicial economy, which joinder is supposed to promote.\nSee Turoff, 853 F.2d at lo42-43; Werner, 62o F.2d at 928; Halper, 59o F.2d at 43o.\n\nA joint trial with the Perjury Counts would also substantially prejudice Ms. Maxwell\nbecause it would necessarily introduce allegations of purported sex abuse from l999-2oo2 for\nwhich Ms. Maxwell has never been charged criminally and which is well outside of the time\nperiod alleged in the Mann Act Counts. The Palm Beach Police Department thoroughly\ninvestigated allegations of Epstein’s sexual abuse in the early-mid 2ooos and did not find any\nevidence against Ms. Maxwell. The documents produced in discovery shou that none of the\nmore than 3o alleged victims who were interviewed in that investigation testified that they met,\ntalked to, or identified Ms. Maxwell as someone involved with Epstein’s alleged scheme.\nMoreover, had the government credited Ms. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s allegations against Ms. Maxwell, it would\nno doubt have charged Ms. Maxwell in the 2ol9 indictment, which charged Epstein alone with\nsex trafficking offenses from 2oo2-2oo5. It did not. Allouing the government to introduce\npurported evidence of an uncharged and unsubstantiated conspiracy with Epstein through the\nvehicle of the Perjury Counts would be extremely prejudicial and create a substantial risk that the\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2292", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002349.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l34 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 2 of 23\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT ....... ee eeeeesereeeeereeeerteeeetertesieee I\nA.

Maxwell, Case No. l5-cv-7433 (LAP) (S.D.N.Y). A Protective\nOrder entered in that case prohibited the parties and their lawyers from sharing confidential\ndiscovery material (including the two Maxwell depositions) with anyone else, including with the\ngovernment and law enforcement. Faced with that Protective Order, the government issued a\nOO —CSCSCSCSCi‘s\nSES l3) proceeding ex parte, the government\nensured that no one before the court would be able to contest the accuracy of its representations\nin support of its application.\n\nThe government then took full advantage.\nOO —SSC‘\nOO —CSCSCSCSC‘ieie‘\nOO —SSCSCSCSSCies\nOO —CSCSCSC‘C‘C‘i\nOO —CSCSC‘C‘(‘CCCS\nOO ——SCSCis\nOO —CtisSCSCSCies«S\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2353", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002354.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l34 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 7 of 23\n\nTo paraphrase Mary McCarthy’s philippic about Lillian Hellman, every word of the\ngovernment’s representation was untrue, “including ‘and’ and ‘the.’”! The government knew\nwhat was in the bad provided that information well before the\ninvestigation began. The government did indeed have previous contact with J. And\nBE was instrumental in fomenting the Maxwell prosecution.\n\nThe record is surpassingly clear: But for the 3 I 7 77\nDs Ver would have permited the circumvention of the civil Protective\nOrder, on which Maxwell relied in agreeing to sit for her depositions. This Court therefore has\nboth the authority and the duty to suppress the fruits of that misrepresentation, including the\nEe 2o the two perjury counts based on those transcripts. If the Court is\ndisinclined to exercise that inherent authority on the present record, Maxwell should be granted a\nhearing to examine the circumstances that resulted in the 7 7\nes.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nA. The Protective Order in <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> v. Maxwell\n\nCounts Five and Six of the superseding indictment allege that Maxwell commited\nperjury during two civil depositions taken in <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> v. Maxwell, a civil defamation case Virginia\n<span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> filed in 2ol5. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> claimed that Maxwell defamed her when Maxwell’s atorney-hired\npress agent denied as “untrue” and “obvious lies” <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s numerous allegations, over the span\nof four years, that Maxwell had participated in a scheme to cause <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> to be “sexually abused\nand trafficked” by Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n' See Norman Mailer, “An Appeal to Lillian Hellman and Mary McCarthy,” 5/ll/8o New York\nTimes.\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2354", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002355.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l34 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 8 of 23\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>, a public figure required to prove actual malice, had an uphill batle—even she\nwas constrained to acknouledge that many of her public statements were false. Using a time-\nhonored if unfortunate litigation tactic, her lawyers at Boies Schiller therefore sought to turn the\nlawsuit into a proxy prosecution of Epstein. Not surprisingly, discovery in the case was biter,\nhard-fought, and wide-ranging. It spanned more than a year and included large document\nproductions, many responses to interrogatories, and thirty-some depositions, including\ndepositions of <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> and Maxwell as well as several third parties. See Broun v. Maxwell, 929\nF.3d 4l, 46, 5l (2d Cir. 2ol9) (explaining that discovery was “hard-fought” and “extensive” and\nnoting that the court file, which includes only some of the documents created during discovery,\ntotals in the “thousands of pages”).\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> sought and obtained a wide variety of private and confidential information about\nMaxwell and others, including information about financial and sexual maters. Broun, 929 F.3d\nat 48 n.22. Given the intimate and highly confidential nature of the discovery exchanged between\nthe parties, the district court entered a stipulated Protective Order. See Ex. A. The Protective\nOrder included a mechanism for one party to challenge another party’s confidentiality\ndesignation (such a challenge never occurred) and provided that it did not apply to any\ninformation or material disclosed at trial. (Because the case setled before trial, that sole\nexception to the Protective Order was never triggered.)\n\nNotably, Boies Schiller sought to add a “law enforcement” exception to the Protective\nOrder, doubtless because the firm was eager to enlist the government in its campaign against\nMaxwell. In particular, Boies Schiller proposed to include a provision stating that\n“CONFIDENTIAL information shall not be disclosed or used for any purpose except the\npreparation and trial of this case and any related mater, including but not limited to,\ninvestigations by law enforcement.” Ex. B J l(a)(4) (emphasis supplied). Maxwell flatly rejected\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2355", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002356.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l34 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 9 of 23\nthis proposal, and it was never included in the Protective Order. Ex. A.” To the contrary, the\norder strictly limited the parties’ disposition of Confidential Material, including at the conclusion\nof the case. In particular, paragraph l2 of the order provided that:\n\n[a]t the conclusion of this case, unless other arrangements are agreed upon, each\n\ndocument and all copies thereof which have been designated as CONFIDENTIAL\n\nshall be returned to the party that designated it CONFIDENTIAL, or the parties\n\nmay elect to destroy CONFIDENTIAL documents. Where the parties agree to\n\ndestroy CONFIDENTIAL documents, the destroying party shall provide all parties\n\nwith an affidavit confirming destruction.\n\nEx. A § l2.\n\nB. Maxwell’s April and July 2ol6 depositions\n\nRelying on the confidentiality protections of the Protective Order, Maxwell declined to\ninvoke her privilege against compulsory self-incrimination and agreed to testify at her April\n2ol6 deposition.

In support of the\nmotion, Boies Schiller assured the district court that “[s]uch questions are entirely appropriate in\nthe discovery phase of this case, particularly where any answers will be maintained as\nconfidential under the Protective Order in this case.”\n\n* This proposal was rejected because of justifiable concerns about the misuse and abuse of this\ninformation by plaintiff and her lawyers including the selection and misleading leaking of confidential\nmaterial to the media, other false claimants, and the government.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2356", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002358.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l34 Filed o2/o4/2l Page ll of 23\nC.

HH.\nNeedless to say, neither Maxwell nor her atorneys were given the opportunity to oppose that\napplication or to contest the government’s representations in support of the application. This was\nall in direct violation of Paragraph l4 of the Protective Order, which provides that the order may\nbe modified by the court only “for good cause shoun follouing notice to all parties and an\nopportunity to be heard.” Ex.

So did the district court in permiting\nthese intrusions and ordering Maxwell to sit for a second deposition. Maxwell likewise relied on\nthe Protective Order in choosing to render such intimate details, rather than assert her Fifth\nAmendment privilege as she had every right to do.\n\nAnd why shouldn’t Maxwell have relied on the Protective Order? The central protection\nin the Order was that none of Maxwell’s answers could be disclosed to the government. Boies\nSchiller had expressly sought a law enforcement exception but was rebuffed. Instead, the law\nfirm was required either to return the confidential material or, at Maxwell’s option, to destroy it.\nMaxwell had every reason to take that assurance seriously, even if J did not.\n\n2. The government circumvented the protective order.\n\nFaced with a duly entered Protective Order—which quite deliberately omited any “law\nenforcement” exception—the government had lawful options to pursue the confidential <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>\ndiscovery. It could have moved to intervene in the civil case and to amend the Protective Order.\nIt could have issued a subpoena for the materials and given Maxwell an opportunity to respond.\nMartindell, 594 F.2d at 294. It could even have applied for a search warrant, assuming\n(counterfactually) that it could shou probable cause in support of such a warrant.\n\nThe government did none of those things. Instead, 3 7 7 _\nOO e—sSCSC‘i\n. Vhis was not among the lawful options available to the government.\n\nIt cannot fairly be disputed that MM ruling to amend the Protective Order\nwas based on the government’s misrepresentations.

According to\nthe prosecution, these false statements were made in a civil defamation lawsuit against Ms.\nMaxwell when she responded to questions in her depositions on April 22, 2ol6 (Count Five) and\nwas compelled by court order, with the promise of confidentiality by the Court and plaintiff's\ncounsel, to respond to additional, immaterial questions in a second deposition on July 22, 2ol6\n(Count Six). These counts fail, as a mater of law, because the questions posed were ambiguous,\nthe answers given were true, and both the questions and answers were immaterial to the\ndefamation action. Accordingly, the Court should dismiss Counts Five and Six.\n\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nI. The Underlying Civil Defamation Action\n\nA. Plaintiffs Claims\n\nIn 2ol5, Virginia Roberts <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> filed an action in this District alleging that Ghislaine\nMaxwell had defamed her. The alleged defamation centered on a statement from Ms. Maxwell’s\natorney denying as “untrue” and “obvious lies” Ms. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s demonstrably false claims about\nher relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and others, including that she had been sexually trafficked\nto foreign presidents and award-winning scientists. The complaint alleged generally that Epstein\n“sexually abused” <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> between l999 and 2oo2 and that Epstein abused more than 3o girls\nbetween 2ool and 2oo7.'\n\nOver the course of discovery in the defamation action, it became obvious that <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>\n(and her lawyers) had lied or misstated critical facts including, inter alia, her age, the various\n\n' See <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> v.

This atempt, houever, involved inadmissible and\nimproper evidence, which was the subject of approximately 5o motions that remained undecided\nat the time that the defamation action was dismissed.\n\nB. Ms. Maxwell’s Depositions\n\nIt is in this context—a weak defamation claim—that Ms. Maxwell was deposed twice.\nBefore her first deposition, houever, the Court granted at Ms. Maxwell’s request a protective\norder to shield any “confidential” information from what was sure to be a high-publicity, media\ncircus. Case No. l5-cv-7433, Doc. # 38. Plaintiff opposed Ms. Maxwell’s proposed protective\norder, instead urging the Court to permit disclosure of “confidential” information in relation to\n“investigations by law enforcement.” /d., Doc. # 4o at 3-4.

The questions contained argumentative, loaded words and\nphrases that <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s lawyers refused to define or clarify and asked Ms. Maxwell to speculate\nabout Epstein’s intent and state of mind. The vast majority of the questions had nothing to do\nwith the actual truth or falsity of the claims of <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> that Ms. Maxwell pointed out as “obvious\nlies.” Counsel for Ms. Maxwell was required to object to hundreds of questions that suffered\nfrom a myriad of form and/or foundational infirmities. Ms. Maxwell, when siting for these\ndepositions, knew she had done nothing wrong and was unaware that <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s lawyers were\nencouraging the Government to initiate a criminal investigation.* And had, no motive to lie in\nresponse, particularly given that Epstein had long ago served a prison sentence in Florida arising\nout of the same conduct that was the subject of the defamation action.\n\nAlthough a few lines of that first deposition testimony are quoted in the Indictment, the\nGovernment improperly redacted objections to the questions and omited important preceding\nand follouing pages of testimony. The omited portions of the transcript include numerous\nobjections and requests for clarification regarding terms that the Government selectively quotes\nin the Indictment, such as “scheme,” “recruit,” and “sexual massage.” The two answers that the\nGovernment claims were knouingly and materially false statements were “I don’t knou what\n\n+ Stephen Rex Broun, “Manhatan federal prosecutors declined to pursue Jeffrey Epstein and\nGhislaine Maxwell case in 2ol6: sources,” New York Daily News (Oct. l3, 2o2o)\n(htps://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-jeffrey-epstein-maxwell-case-2o2olol3-\njmzhl7zdrzdgrbbs7yc6ebfnszu-story.html) (detailing David Boies’ purported efforts to urge the SDNY US\nAtorney’s Office to prosecute Ms. Maxwell in February 2ol6, shortly before her first deposition, and\nagain after her second deposition, arguing in apparent violation of the protective order that she had\ncommited perjury during her “confidential” depositions).\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo24l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002419.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl36 Filed o2/o4/2l Page lo of 27\nyou're talking about” and an inability to “list” (sixteen years after the fact) “all of the people\nunder the age of l8” that she interacted with at “any of Jeffrey [Epstein’s] property.”\n\nBecause Ms. Maxwell had refused, on advice of counsel, to answer irrelevant questions at\nthat April 2ol6 deposition that concerned her consensual adult sexual activity with others\nincluding Mr. Epstein, Ms. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s counsel sought a second deposition a short time later.

The testimony was marked\n“Confidential.” Again, plaintiff vastly exceeded the bounds of the permited topics, including in\nthe questions that are quoted in Count 6 of the Indictment. The excerpts reproduced in the\nIndictment, as with Count 5, similarly ignore the questions, answers, and objections that\noccurred over the course of the deposition, as well as other objections in the case concerning the\nrelevant time frame for discovery purposes.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo24l9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002420.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l36 Filed o2/o4/2l Page ll of 27\n\nIn mid-2ol6 after this second deposition, according to media reports, <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s lawyers\nurged the Government to charge Ms. Maxwell with perjury based on her testimony.” It is\nunclear hou the atorneys could have done so without violating the protective order, which\nforbade them from sharing the contents of these “confidential” depositions with law\nenforcement.\n\nII. The Indictment\n\nCount Five of the Indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell made two false statements during\nthe first deposition in April 2ol6.

Post-Indictment Proceedings in the Civil Case\n\nAs the Court is already well-aware based on prior litigation, Judge Preska currently is\n\noverseeing both the remand unsealing proceedings in the <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> v. Maxwell case as well as the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> v. Dershouitz mater. Last week, Judge Preska issued a ruling in connection with the\nrequest from Ms. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> and the Miami Herald to unseal the second Maxwell deposition from\nJuly 2ol6. As is pertinent here, Judge Preska ruled:\n\n“During this deposition, Ms. Maxwell was asked repeatedly about her oun sexual\n\nactivity with consenting adults. Unlike in her prior deposition, at her July 2ol6\n\ndeposition, she provided testimony in response to those questions. . . . This\n\ntestimony is, in any case, far afield from the sex trafficking and sexual abuse\n\nallegations that were central to the dispute in <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> v. Maxwell.”\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo242l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002430.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl36 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 2l of 27\n\nre\na\nee\na\nLe\n\nee\n\nee\nSC\n\na\nee\nee\nLe\n\neeeCS\nEx.

In the context of these questions, Ms. Maxwell was asked “with\nwhom did Mr. Epstein have sexual activities.” Again, this imprecise, boundless, ambiguous, and\nuntethered question drew an objection. The answer, charged as perjury, was that “when I was\nwith him,” i.e., having sex with Epstein, Ms. Maxwell “wasn’t aware that he was having sexual\nactivities with anyone” other than herself.

Counts 5 and 6 Should Be Dismissed\n\nNone of the questions that elicited the allegedly perjurious testimony were material to the\nproceeding in which the testimony was given. As Judge Preska ruled, the questions were “far\nafield from the sex trafficking and sexual abuse allegations that were central to the dispute in\n<span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> v. Maxwell.” Ex. l at 7. Ms. Maxwell was a civil defendant in a defamation action\npremised upon a statement issued by her lawyer in the United Kingdom that <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s claims\nwere “obvious lies”—a statement that was, as shoun above, true. Whether Ms. Maxwell was\nable to make a list of “girls” who were at Mr. Epstein’s properties, knew who Epstein was\nhaving sex with (apparently when Ms. Maxwell was having sex with Epstein), was aware of the\n“presence of toys or devices,” or gave a massage to Epstein or Accuser-2 was completely\nirrelevant to the defamation litigation.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s testimony could not have influenced any fact finder in the civil case, nor\ncould the questions—no mater hou they were answered—have reasonably led to any admissible\nevidence in the defamation action, which required <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> to prove that her statements about her\nage, her being trafficked to unspecified “foreign presidents” and Professor Dershouitz, or\nwhether President Clinton flew on a helicopter piloted by Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as other\ndemonstrably false statements, were true.°\n\n® In the event that Counts Five and Six are not dismissed, Ms. Maxwell would request that\nadditional excerpts be read those to the jury beyond those set forth in the Indictment, including but not\nlimited to those set forth in this motion, for purposes of completeness.

In his response opposing the stay of discovery, Mr. Boies represented\nto the court that “Maxwell has provided no information about the subject mater of the criminal\ninvestigation into Mr. Epstein’s co-conspirators, the status of the investigation, or even disclosed\nwhether she herself is a target of the Southern District’s investigation.” /d., Dkt. 72.

The sharp\ncontrast between the government’s actions in this Jane Doe civil mater, and the Annie Farmer\ncivil mater, the <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> mater, and the Ransome mater also establish a strong inference that as\nlong as the government stood to gain a tactical advantage by delaying the indictment (the sought-\nafter deposition in the Farmer civil litigation), it would not move to intervene. Houever, where\nthe government’s tactical advantage was lost or threatened (Jane Doe) it would shut the case\ndoun.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nMs. Maxwell requests that the Court dismiss the Indictment because of the prejudicial\n\nand tactical delay by the government in prosecuting this case.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2527", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002562.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l4o Filed o2/o4/2l Page l4 of 22\n\nNeither Miller nor Smith supports a conclusion that Maxwell had anything but a\nlegitimate and reasonable expectation of privacy in her I.

The Fifth Amendment would mean\nnothing if an individual were told by a district court that she need not invoke its protections\nbecause the government could not use her testimony against her—or at least could not do so\nwithout notice and an opportunity to be heard—only to find out that the testimony she offered\nwith the district court’s blessing was the primary evidence against her in a criminal case and the\nbasis of perjury charges.\n\nThat is the lesson of United States v.

Oshatz (who had been indicted at the\ntime of his deposition) was deposed and did not invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against\nself-incrimination on “the understanding that a protective order would preserve his Fifth\nAmendment rights.” /d. at 699. Applying Martindell, this Court quashed the government’s\nsubpoena and refused to release the deposition transcript because the “government [had] not\nargued that the protective order was improvidently granted or that there [were] some\nextraordinary circumstances or compelling need.” /d. at 7ol.\n\nHere, as in Oshatz, Maxwell was deposed on “the understanding that a protective order\nwould preserve” the confidentiality of her testimony. And even though Maxwell had not been\nindicted at the time of her depositions, the threat of an investigation was obvious, and that threat\nwas the very reason the Protective Order deliberately excluded a law-enforcement exception.\n(Moreover, Maxwell moved the court to require <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> to disclose any law enforcement\ninvestigation of which she was aware.) As in Oshatz, the Protective Order was designed to\npreserve Maxwell’s Fifth Amendment rights.

Maxwell,\nNo. 2o-24l3 (2d Cir. July 3o, 2o2o), ECF No. lo-l (explaining the Defendant’s “concerns that\n[Ms. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>] and [BSF] were acting as either express or de facto agents of the government” and\nfalsely accusing BSF of leaking a confidential deposition transcript to the Government). The\nSubpoena, which seeks, for example, communications between BSF and the Government and\nBSF’s submissions on behalf of its clients to an independent claims program administered by\nJeffrey Epstein’s Estate, is a transparent atempt to further this false narrative and to fish for\npotential impeachment material. But a fishing expedition for potential impeachment material goes\nwell beyond the scope of a permissible Rule l7(c) subpoena. The Defendant’s motion to authorize\nservice of the Subpoena on BSF should be denied.!\n\nTHE REQUIREMENTS OF RULE l7(C)\n\nRule l7(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure Rule governs nonparty subpoenas\nin criminal proceedings. Rule l7(c) “was not intended to provide a means of discovery for criminal\ncases.” United States v. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 698 (l974); see also, e.g., United States v. Barnes,\n56o F. App’x 36, 39 (2d Cir. 2ol4) (“Rule l7 subpoenas are properly used to obtain admissible\nevidence, not as a substitute for discovery.”); United States v. Cherry, 876 F. Supp. 547, 553\n(S.D.N.Y. l995) (explaining that although the civil rules permit subpoenas “to seek production of\ndocuments or other materials which, although not themselves admissible, could lead to admissible\nevidence,” criminal “Rule l7(c) cannot be used to obtain leads as to the existence of additional\ndocumentary evidence or to seek information relating to the defendant’s case” (internal quotation\nmarks omited)). Accordingly, a party seeking a Rule l7(c) subpoena must demonstrate:\n\n(l) that the documents are evidentiary and relevant; (2) that they are not otherwise\n\nprocurable reasonably in advance of trial by exercise of due diligence; (3) that the\nl A motion to quash the Subpoena is not yet ripe because, without having the benefit of the\nDefendant’s sealed briefing on her motion and any other orders pertaining to it, it appears that the\nCourt has not granted Defendant’s motion for an order authorizing service of the Subpoena on\nBSF. The Court, houever, should exercise its discretion and deny the Defendant’s motion. See\nUnited States v. Weissman, No. ol Cr. 529 (BSJ), 2oo2 WL l467845, at *l (S.D.N.Y. July 8,\n2oo2) (“Rule l7(c) expressly commits the decision whether to require pre-trial production of\ndocuments to the sound discretion of the court.”). Should the Court wish to hear further from BSF\nprior to deciding the Motion, BSF is prepared to appear before the Court and/or move to intervene\nand to quash the Subpoena.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo28l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002818.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl83 Filed o3/26/2l Page /7of7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nMarch 22, 2o2l\nPage 7 of 7\nMaterial,” which is clearly sought for impeachment purposes, is not a proper subject of a Rule\nl7(c) subpoena.\n\nThird, certain of the documents that the Defendant seeks to obtain from BSF are “otherwise\nprocurable” from the Government. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 699 (documents requested pursuant to Rule\nl7(c) must not be “otherwise procurable” from another source). Requests l and 2 both seek\ncommunications between BSF and the U.S. Atorney, which the Defendant can procure from the\nGovernment. Similarly, Request 8 seeks a Grand Jury Subpoena that gg by the\nGovernment itself, and that the Defendant can therefore procure from the Government. Thus, a\nRule l7(c) subpoena to BSF for those documents is improper. See, e.g., United States v. Bergstein,\nNo. l6 Cr. 746 (PKC), 2ol7 WL 6887596, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 28, 2ol7) (‘““When ‘many’ of the\nsubpoenaed materials are obtainable through the discovery process, a subpoena contravenes\nNixon’s requirement that subpoenaed materials must not be otherwise procurable in advance of\ntrial by the exercise of due diligence.”); United States v. Boyle, No. o8 Cr. 523 (CM), 2oo9 WL\n484436, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 24, 2oo9) (quashing a l7(c) subpoena where it was “likely that many\nof the documents that defendant seeks in his subpoena are obtainable from another source—the\nUnited States Atorney’s Office—with litle or no diligence required”).\n\nFinally, Requests lo and ll seek items that can be produced at trial if they are shoun to be\nrelevant and admissible. Request lo seeks a pair of couboy boots that the Defendant and Jeffrey\nEpstein purchased for Annie Farmer for inspection and copying. Request ll seeks the original\ncopies of various photographs of Annie Farmer when she was a teenager, of Maria Farmer on\nLeslie Wexner’s property, of Virginia <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> on various of Jeffrey Epstein and the Defendant’s\nproperties, and of Virginia <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>, Prince Andrew, and the Defendant in the Defendant’s London\ntounhome. Although the relevance of these items is minimal—the photographs, for example, do\nnot appear to depict any conduct or event described in the indictment—the Defendant cannot shou\nthat she “cannot properly prepare for trial without such production and inspection in advance of\ntrial and that the failure to obtain such inspection may tend unreasonably to delay the trial,” which\nis an independent requirement under Nixon. 4l8 U.S. at 699. There is simply no reason why, if\nthe Farmers and Ms. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> ultimately testify and if these items prove to be relevant and\nadmissible, these items cannot be produced for inspection at trial.\n\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, the Defendant’s motion to authorize service of the\nSubpoena on BSF should be denied\n\nRespectfully submited,\n/s/ Sigrid S.

The\nSubpoena, which seeks, for example, communications between BSF and the Government and\nBSF’s submissions on behalf of its clients to an independent claims program administered by\nJeffrey Epstein’s Estate, is a transparent atempt to further this false narrative and to fish for\npotential impeachment material. But a fishing expedition for potential impeachment material goes\nwell beyond the scope of a permissible Rule l7(c) subpoena. The Defendant’s motion to authorize\nservice of the Subpoena on BSF should be denied.!\n\nTHE REQUIREMENTS OF RULE l7(C)\n\nRule l7(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure Rule governs nonparty subpoenas\nin criminal proceedings. Rule l7(c) “was not intended to provide a means of discovery for criminal\ncases.” United States v. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 698 (l974); see also, e.g., United States v. Barnes,\n56o F. App’x 36, 39 (2d Cir. 2ol4) (“Rule l7 subpoenas are properly used to obtain admissible\nevidence, not as a substitute for discovery.”); United States v. Cherry, 876 F. Supp. 547, 553\n(S.D.N.Y. l995) (explaining that although the civil rules permit subpoenas “to seek production of\ndocuments or other materials which, although not themselves admissible, could lead to admissible\nevidence,” criminal “Rule l7(c) cannot be used to obtain leads as to the existence of additional\ndocumentary evidence or to seek information relating to the defendant’s case” (internal quotation\nmarks omited)). Accordingly, a party seeking a Rule l7(c) subpoena must demonstrate:\n\n(l) that the documents are evidentiary and relevant; (2) that they are not otherwise\n\nprocurable reasonably in advance of trial by exercise of due diligence; (3) that the\n: A motion to quash the Subpoena is not yet ripe because, without having the benefit of the\nDefendant’s sealed briefing on her motion and any other orders pertaining to it, it appears that the\nCourt has not granted Defendant’s motion for an order authorizing service of the Subpoena on\nBSF. The Court, houever, should exercise its discretion and deny the Defendant’s motion. See\nUnited States v. Weissman, No. ol Cr. 529 (BSJ), 2oo2 WL l467845, at *l (S.D.N.Y. July 8,\n2oo2) (“Rule l7(c) expressly commits the decision whether to require pre-trial production of\ndocuments to the sound discretion of the court.”). Should the Court wish to hear further from BSF\nprior to deciding the Motion, BSF is prepared to appear before the Court and/or move to intervene\nand to quash the Subpoena.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2878", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002883.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl9l Filed o3/3o/2l Page/7of7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nMarch 22, 2o2l\nPage 7 of 7\nMaterial,” which is clearly sought for impeachment purposes, is not a proper subject of a Rule\nl7(c) subpoena.\n\nThird, certain of the documents that the Defendant seeks to obtain from BSF are “otherwise\nprocurable” from the Government. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 699 (documents requested pursuant to Rule\nl7(c) must not be “otherwise procurable” from another source). Requests l and 2 both seek\ncommunications between BSF and the U.S. Atorney, which the Defendant can procure from the\nGovernment. Similarly, Request 8 seeks a Grand Jury Subpoena that was served on BSF by the\nGovernment itself, and that the Defendant can therefore procure from the Government. Thus, a\nRule l7(c) subpoena to BSF for those documents is improper. See, e.g., United States v. Bergstein,\nNo. l6 Cr. 746 (PKC), 2ol7 WL 6887596, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 28, 2ol7) (“When ‘many’ of the\nsubpoenaed materials are obtainable through the discovery process, a subpoena contravenes\nNixon’s requirement that subpoenaed materials must not be otherwise procurable in advance of\ntrial by the exercise of due diligence.”); United States v. Boyle, No. o8 Cr. 523 (CM), 2oo9 WL\n484436, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 24, 2oo9) (quashing a l7(c) subpoena where it was “likely that many\nof the documents that defendant seeks in his subpoena are obtainable from another source—the\nUnited States Atorney’s Office—with litle or no diligence required”).\n\nFinally, Requests lo and ll seek items that can be produced at trial if they are shoun to be\nrelevant and admissible. Request lo seeks a pair of couboy boots that the Defendant and Jeffrey\nEpstein purchased for Annie Farmer for inspection and copying. Request ll seeks the original\ncopies of various photographs of Annie Farmer when she was a teenager, of Maria Farmer on\nLeslie Wexner’s property, of Virginia <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> on various of Jeffrey Epstein and the Defendant’s\nproperties, and of Virginia <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>, Prince Andrew, and the Defendant in the Defendant’s London\ntounhome. Although the relevance of these items is minimal—the photographs, for example, do\nnot appear to depict any conduct or event described in the indictment—the Defendant cannot shou\nthat she “cannot properly prepare for trial without such production and inspection in advance of\ntrial and that the failure to obtain such inspection may tend unreasonably to delay the trial,” which\nis an independent requirement under Nixon. 4l8 U.S. at 699. There is simply no reason why, if\nthe Farmers and Ms. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> ultimately testify and if these items prove to be relevant and\nadmissible, these items cannot be produced for inspection at trial.\n\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, the Defendant’s motion to authorize service of the\nSubpoena on BSF should be denied\n\nRespectfully submited,\n/s/ Sigrid S.

See, e.g., Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL\n4o43l4o (denying motion to dismiss for pre-indictment delay as to conduct charged in 2ol6\ninvolving sexual abuse of minors from l998 to 2oo7 as defendant failed to satisfy both prongs of\npre-indictment delay standard); United States v.

For instance, Maxwell asserts that it\n“has been advantageous to the government to have aggressive lawyers collecting information from\nMs. Maxwell as part of civil discovery and disseminating that information to the public, as part of\nan ongoing campaign to vilify Ms. Maxwell.” (Def. Mot. 7 at l6). She again cites the subpoena\nthe Government issued to Boies Schiller & Flexner LLP (“Boies Schiller”) to obtain materials\nfrom the <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> civil litigation. (/d.). Leaving aside the fact that, as set forth in Section IV, the\nGovernment obtained such materials through a judicially approved and entirely appropriate\n\n56\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ol7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003018.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 84 of 239\nprocess, the inference that the defendant urges this Court to draw—that the Government delayed\nseeking an indictment to gain a tactical advantage and did so through strategy in the pending civil\nlitigation—is both unsupported by the record and illogical.\n\nThe defendant makes much of the Government having moved to intervene and stay the\nproceedings in Doe v. Indyke, No. 2o Civ. 484 (JGK), while the Government has not moved to\nstay <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> v. Maxwell. (Def. Mot. 7 at l6-l9). She suggests that there is some “sharp contrast”\nbetween the Government’s actions in the various civil maters, which “establish a strong inference\nthat as long as the government stood to gain a tactical advantage by delaying the indictment. . ., it\nwould not move to intervene.” (/d. at l9). Seting the defendant’s conspiracy theories aside, the\ncivil maters were in completely different procedural postures, which implicate different concerns\nregarding a pending criminal case. The <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> v. Maxwell litigation was setled and complete\nwell before the Government even opened its investigation in this case. By contrast, the Doe v.\nIndyke case was initiated after the Government opened its investigation and remained ongoing\nafter the Indictment in this case was filed.?? The defendant quotes the Government’s leter to Judge\nFreeman requesting permission to intervene and stay Doe v. Indyke (see id.), but omits the portion\nof that leter in which the Government explained that, as far as it was aware, Doe v. Indyke was\nthe “lone case in this District that has not yet been either resolved or stayed at this point... . In\n3 In particular, <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> v. Maxwell was resolved in 2ol7 and the determination of what material\nshould remain sealed remains the only open issue. Accordingly, there is no more discovery to be\nconducted in the <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> case and no possible concern to the Government that, for example, its\ntrial witnesses in the criminal case might be deposed in that civil case. In Doe v. Indyke, on the\nother hand, discovery was just beginning, and if discovery were to have proceeded, multiple\nwitnesses or potential witnesses at the criminal trial would likely have been subject to deposition.\nThat concern, among others, raised a significant risk that proceeding with the civil mater would\nadversely affect the ongoing criminal prosecution against the defendant. Moreover, the interests\nof judicial economy and the public interest in enforcement of the criminal law were served by a\nstay in the Doe case because the outcome of the criminal case could resolve disputed issues in the\nDoe case. Such concerns are not present in <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> v. Maxwell.\n\n57\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ol8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003022.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 88 of 239\n\nA. Factual Background\n\nThe defendant’s motion is, at its core, premised on a false factual narrative. The defendant\nalleges, based on a New York Daily News article, that Boies Schiller and the Government colluded\nstarting in at least early 2ol6 with the “precise[] design[]” of having the defendant “charged with\nperjury.” (Def. Mot. 3 at lo). In particular, she claims that Boies Schiller met with the\nGovernment in February 2ol6, urged the Government to open an investigation of Epstein and\nMaxwell, told the Government what was in its files, and met with the Government again in the\nsummer of 2ol6 to ask if it would consider charging the defendant with perjury after her two\ndepositions. (/d. at 2, 8).\n\nThat is not so. While a nou former Assistant United States Atorney (““AUSA-l”) met\nwith a lawyer from Boies Schiller and two other atorneys about Epstein in February 2ol6, that\nmeeting was not focused on the defendant, and AUSA-l did not participate in a second meeting\nwith those atorneys. Moreover, that February 2ol6 meeting pre-dated the depositions that gave\nrise to the perjury counts in the Indictment, which itself was obtained more than four years\nthereafter.° The Indictment was instead the product of an investigation that was not opened until\nlate 2ol8 and that had nothing to do with a meeting that had taken place nearly three years earlier\nwith an AUSA who played no part in the decision to open the 2ol8 investigation and similarly\nplayed no part in the 2ol8 investigation itself.\n\nl. The Civil Lawsuit against Maxwell\n\nIn or about September 2ol5, <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>, represented by Boies Schiller, filed a civil defamation\nlawsuit against Maxwell in the Southern District of New York. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt.\n°6 While, as discussed herein, the Government has uncovered evidence of a phone call from one\nof the atorneys, Stan Potinger, to AUSA-l in early May 2ol6, AUSA-l has no specific memory\nof that call, nor did AUSA-l provide any notes or records of that call to the team working on the\ninstant investigation.\n\n6l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o22", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003023.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 89 of 239\n\nNo. l). In short, <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> alleged that Maxwell had defamed her when Maxwell stated that <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>\nwas not the victim of sex crimes perpetrated by Epstein and Maxwell. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> alleged that\nMaxwell had made those false statements for the “malicious purpose of further damaging a sexual\nabuse and sexual trafficking victim; to destroy <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s reputation and credibility; to cause the\nworld to disbelieve <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>; and to destroy <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s efforts to use her experience to help others\nsuffering as sex trafficking victims.” (/d. at 8).\n\nps February 2ol6 Meeting\n\nAtorney Peter Skinner of Boies Schiller contacted AUSA-l, who was at that time the\nHuman Trafficking and Project Safe Childhood Coordinator of the USAO-SDNY, to request an\nopportunity for him and other atorneys to meet with AUSA-l to present on a potential case. (See\nEx. 4 at l).277 AUSA-l agreed to the meeting, and on or about February 29, 2ol6, AUSA-l met\nwith three atorneys—Peter Skinner of Boies Schiller, Brad Edwards, and Stan Potinger—\nregarding Jeffrey Epstein. (See Ex. 4 at l). Edwards and Potinger were also atorneys for Virginia\nRoberts <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>, who had alleged that she is a victim of sex crimes perpetrated by Epstein and\nMaxwell.”® (Ex. 5 at l).\n\nAt the meeting, Edwards provided AUSA-l with details about, among other things, the\nUSAO-SDFL’s prior investigation of Epstein, as well as <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s personal history and experience\nwith Epstein. (See Ex. 5). The focus of the meeting was on Epstein, and AUSA-l understood that\nthe atorneys were advocating that the USAO-SDNY open an investigation into Epstein. (See Ex.\n7 On February ll, 2o2l, to help gather facts relevant to the reporting contained in the New York\nDaily News article, the USAO-SDNY and the FBI conducted a telephonic interview of AUSA-l.\nNotes of that interview are atached as Exhibit 4.\n\n?8 Peter Skinner of Boies Schiller is not listed on the docket as an atorney representing <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>.\n?° AUSA-l’s notes from the February 29, 2ol6 meeting are atached as Exhibit 5.\n62\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o23", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003025.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 9l of 239\n\nEx. 7), but AUSA-l does not recall the details of that conversation (see Ex. 4 at 4), nor is the\nGovernment aware of any notes or other records documenting the substance of the call. The\nGovernment has not identified any records that suggest AUSA-l ever communicated via email\nwith Potinger, Edwards, Skinner, or any other atorney at Boies Schiller regarding this mater after\nMay 3, 2ol6.\n\nThe USAO-SDNY did not open an investigation into Epstein or Maxwell in 2ol6. (d. at\n4).\n\n3. The April and July 2ol6 Depositions of Maxwell\n\nOn March 2, 2ol6, Maxwell moved for entry of a protective order for materials produced\nin discovery and submited a proposed order for the consideration of the Honorable Robert W.\nSweet, the United States District Judge who was then overseeing the <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> v. Maxwell civil\nlitigation. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. Nos. 38 & 39-l). On or about March 4, 2ol6, Boies\nSchiller represented that <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> did not oppose the entry of a protective order, but opposed the\nform proposed by Maxwell out of concern that it was overly broad and could lead to over-\ndesignation of material as confidential. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. 4o at 2). Boies Schiller\nsubmited a redline of Maxwell’s proposed protective order, deleting some provisions and adding\nlanguage that confidential material could be disclosed to law enforcement. (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. B).\nOn March l8, 2ol6, Judge Sweet entered a protective order governing the discovery and\ndissemination of confidential information after the parties agreed to the form of the order originally\nproposed by Maxwell.

The USAO-SDNY Commences the Instant Investigation in 2ol8\n\nOn or about November 29, 2ol8, the USAO-SDNY initiated its investigation into Epstein\nand possible co-conspirators, and formally opened the investigation by completing the requisite\npaperwork to open an investigation on or about November 3o, 2ol8. The investigation was\nprompted by a series of articles published by the Miami Herald earlier that same week relating to\nEpstein, his conduct, and the circumstances of his prior conviction. See Julie K. Broun, “Even\nfrom Jail, Sex Abuser Manipulated the System. His Victims Were Kept in the Dark,” Miami\nHerald (Nov. 28, 2ol8).*!_AUSA-l was not involved in the decision to open the investigation or\nin the investigation itself. (See Ex. 4 at 6). Indeed, AUSA-l stopped serving as the Office’s\nHuman Trafficking and Project Safe Childhood Coordinator as of April 2ol7.\n\nShortly after initiating the investigation, the prosecutors involved in the investigation\nlearned of the prior February 2ol6 meeting and requested copies of AUSA-l’s notes and records\n3l Indeed, on July 8, 2ol9, at the press conference follouing the arrest of Epstein, Geoffrey S.\nBerman, then United States Atorney for the Southern District of New York, stated that while he\nwas not “going to go into any aspects of hou our investigation originated[,] I will say that we were\nassisted from some excellent investigative journalism.”\n\n65\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o26", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003027.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 93 of 239\nfrom that meeting. On or about December 6, 2ol8, AUSA-l provided the prosecutors with her\nnotes from the February 2ol6 meeting (which are atached as Exhibit 5) and documents the\natorneys provided.*?\n\nSs The USAO-SDNY’s Subpoenas and Ex Parte Applications for\nMaterials\n\nShortly after opening the investigation in late November 2ol8, the Government identified\npossible victims and their counsel through public filings or media reports, which included Boies\nSchiller. (Def. Mem. 3, Ex. E at 2-3). The USAO-SDNY first contacted Boies Schiller about its\ninvestigation on or about December l8, 2ol8. Shortly thereafter, in or about December or January\n2ol8, the Government indicated to Boies Schiller that it intended to make document requests.\nBoies Schiller generally advised the Government that a protective order would govern some of the\nmaterials. (/d. at 3).\n\nIn or about February 2ol9, approximately two months after the USAO-SDNY opened its\ninvestigation (and almost three years after the February 29, 2ol6 meeting described above), the\nUSAO-SDNY issued two criminal grand jury subpoenas to Boies Schiller. One of the subpoenas\nrequested non-privileged documents relating to <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> v. Maxwell, l5 Civ. 7433 (RWS); the other\n>? The Government has reviewed the file that AUSA-l provided to the prosecution team on or\nabout December 6, 2ol8 and understands, based on a review of that file, that at the February 2ol6\nmeeting, AUSA-l received copies of Epstein’s black book, flight records, and Palm Beach Police\nDepartment reports. Although AUSA-l does not nou recall the atorneys providing her with any\ndocuments at the meeting (Ex. 4 at 2), an email she sent to the prosecution team on December 6,\n2ol8 refers to these documents as materials that the atorneys provided at the meeting.\n\nThe Government notes that as of March 7, 2ol6, one week after AUSA-l’s February 29,\n2ol6 meeting with the atorneys when she received these documents, Maxwell had only produced\ntwo emails in response to <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s discovery requests. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. 43 at\nl-2). None of the documents apparently provided to AUSA-l during the February 2ol6 meeting\nwas an email. Accordingly, the Government has no reason to believe that <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s counsel\nprovided AUSA-l with any discovery materials from the <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> v. Maxwell civil case. AUSA-l\nalso does not believe she ever received any such discovery materials.

(Def. Mot. 3, Exs. F & G). The Court noted that while the\nGovernment’s application was procedurally “[i]rregular,” there was precedent for granting the\nGovernment’s request and, therefore, the Court would consider the application. (Def. Mot. 3, Ex.\nG at 6, 8-9). The Court found that, contrary to the Government’s arguments, it was appropriate\nfor the Court to analyze the Government’s application in light of the Martindell factors. (/d. at 9-\nl2).\n\nIn so doing, Chief Judge McMahon considered, among other things, “the degree to which\n. . . the party who could be expected to oppose unsealing[] reasonably relied on the protective\norder.” (/d. at l6). She concluded that such reliance was unreasonable. (/d. at 22). She evaluated\nthe factors under Second Circuit case law that are relevant to assessing whether a party’s reliance\non the protective order was reasonable, namely the scope of the protective order, the language of\nthe order itself, the court’s level of inquiry before granting the order, and the nature of reliance on\nthe order. (/d. at l7). She concluded that first three factors favored granting the Government’s\napplication for modification. (/d. at l7-2o). Chief Judge McMahon noted that, as the order\n“plainly gives the court the pouer to enter an order compelling disclosure to anyone—law\nenforcement included—Maxwell could not reasonably have relied on the absence of automatic\npermission for such disclosure to shield anything she said or produced from a grand jury’s\nscrutiny.” (/d. at l8-l9).\n\nAs to the last factor, Chief Judge McMahon found that “the nature of the parties’ reliance\non the order does seem to weigh against modification.” (/d. at 2o). She noted that the record\nindicated that “<span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> likely could not have secured Maxwell’s deposition—at least in the absence\nof substantial court involvement—without” the protective order.

But I am not faced with\nthat situation.” (/d. at 2l). Chief Judge McMahon further stated, “Nothing in this record suggests\nto me that <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> or Boies Schiller had anything to do with the Government’s decision to convene\na grand jury to look into the maters that were the subject of the [civil lawsuit].” (Ud.). Instead,\nshe explained that the Government informed the Court that it had “contacted Boies Schiller as part\nof its search for parties who might have been victims in its investigation; and that Boies Schiller\ntold the Government that it could not consensually produce at least some documents in its files\nbecause of the existence of the Protective Order.” (/d.). Chief Judge McMahon concluded that it\nwas “quite clear that Boies Schiller did not foment the Government’s investigation.” (/d.).\n\nAmong other conclusions, Chief Judge McMahon found that because Maxwell’s reliance\non the protective order in that case as a “shield [. . .] from the court-ordered disclosure of\nConfidential Materials pursuant to a grand jury subpoena was unreasonable, the Court may\nexercise its discretion to grant the Government’s application.” (/d. at 22). The Court further\nconcluded that “[t]he Government has persuasively demonstrated extraordinary circumstances,\nwhich would entitle it to modification in any event.” (/d.). She also noted that “while in other\ncircumstances the breadth of the subpoena might be troubling, here the Government is in no\nposition to narrou its request, because [the civil case] was litigated almost entirely under seal.”\n(Id. at 25).\n\nChief Judge McMahon permited that the Government share the order—and only that\norder, which itself prohibited further dissemination, and not including any other materials\nassociated with the Government’s application—with Boies Schiller. The relevant order was\n\n73\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o34", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003035.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page lol of 239\nprovided to Boies Schiller shortly after it was issued.

Epstein, et al., l7 Civ. o6l6 (JGK) (SN),\nof Chief Judge McMahon’s decision via ex parte and sealed leter. (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. I).\nSubsequently, on April l6, 2ol9, Judge Netburn denied the Government’s application. (Def. Mot.\n3, Ex. H). Judge Netburn found that she was authorized under the All Writs Act to modify the\nprotective order, but declined to do so as the Government had not established exceptional\ncircumstances or a compelling need. (/d. at 3). She concluded that on the record before her, the\nparties’ reliance on the protective order was reasonable and the presumption of confidentiality\nshould apply. (/d. at 5-6). The court rejected the Government’s arguments for exceptional\ncircumstances and compelling need as relying on “the general desire for secrecy” and\n“unpersuasive” under the Martindell standard. (/d. at 6). Judge Netburn concluded that “the\nGovernment must demonstrate not that this investigation is an extraordinary circumstance, but that\nthe reason for seeking the documents is so extraordinary or compelling that there is a need to\nmodify the Protective Order. The Government has not met that standard.” (/d. at 7) (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\n8. Unsealing of Maxwell’s Depositions\n\nThree months after Chief Judge McMahon issued her Order, <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> v. Maxwell was\nreassigned to the Honorable Loreta A.

On or about July 23, 2o2o, Judge\nPreska ordered unsealed certain litigation materials, including, and related to, Maxwell’s April\n\n74\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o35", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003036.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo2 of 239\n2ol6 deposition transcript. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. lo77). Maxwell appealed Judge\nPreska’s order, arguing that the court abused its discretion in ordering the unsealing of the\ndeposition materials and that Maxwell’s interests outweighed the public’s interests in access to the\nmaterials. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> v. Maxwell, No. 2o-24l3 (2d Cir.), (Dkt. No. l4o-l at 2). On October l9, 2o2o,\nthe Second Circuit found that Judge Preska “correctly held that the deposition materials are judicial\ndocuments to which the presumption of public access ataches, and did not abuse its discretion in\nrejecting Maxwell’s meritless arguments that her interests superseded the presumption of access.”\n(Id. at 3).\n\nOn October 22, 2o2o, Maxwell’s April 2ol6 deposition was publicly filed. (See l5 Civ.\n7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. ll37-l3).\n\nOn January 27, 2o2l, a redacted version of Maxwell’s July 2ol6 deposition was publicly\nfiled. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. l2ol-l4). On February ll, 2o2l, another version of the\nJuly 2ol6 deposition was publicly filed with fewer redactions. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No.\nl2l2-l).\n\n9. The New York Daily News Article\n\nOn October l3, 2o2o, the New York Daily News published an article describing the\nFebruary 29, 2ol6 meeting (the “Daily News Article” or the “Article”).*° The Article stated,\namong other things, that defense atorneys representing victims of Epstein and Maxwell “urged”\nthe USAO-SDNY to “open an investigation of the duo” during that meeting. Citing two\nanonymous sources, the Article described the defense atorneys’ alleged efforts to “pique” the\nGovernment’s interest “in a second meeting in the summer of 2ol6 after Maxwell allegedly\n3° See Stephen Rex Broun, Manhatan federal prosecutors declined to pursue Jeffrey Epstein and\nGhislaine Maxwell case in 2ol6: sources, New York Daily News, Oct. l3, 2o2o,\nhtps://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-jeffrey-epstein-maxwell-case-2o2olol3-\njmzhl7zdrzdgrbbs7ycebfnszu-story.html.\n\n75\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o36", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003046.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll2 of 239\nmarks omited) (emphasis added)); In re “Agent Orange” Prod. Liab. Litig., 82l F.2d at l45 (“It\nis undisputed that a district court retains the pouer to modify or lift protective orders that it has\nentered.”). It also bears noting that Martindell and its progeny do not discuss law enforcement\napplications in Fourth Amendment terms.\n\nIn an effort to avoid the application of the third party doctrine, Maxwell contends that she\ndid not in fact voluntarily share anything in the civil suit, and that “every other circumstance”\nsupported her “expectation that her deposition transcripts would be private.” (Def. Mot. ll at 9).\nNeither argument withstands scrutiny. As an initial mater, the facts of this case are far removed\nfrom the “narrou” circumstances in which the Supreme Court has found an exception to the third\nparty doctrine. For example, the Carpenter Court, while stressing that its holding was a “narrou\none,” l38 S. Ct. at 222o, held that “[g]iven the unique nature of cell phone location records,” which\nprovide a “intimate windou into a person’s life,” “the fact that the information is held by a third\nparty does not by itself overcome the user’s claim to Fourth Amendment protection.” /d. at 22l7;\nsee also Zietzke v. United States, 426 F. Supp. 3d 758, 768 (W.D. Wash. 2ol9) (“The Court...\nwill extend Carpenter to new circumstances only if they directly implicate the privacy concerns\nthat animated the majority. [T]he majority was overwhelmingly concerned with ‘Carpenter’s\nanticipation of privacy in his physical location.’ In other words, Carpenter was about\nsurveillance.” (internal citation omited)).\n\nThere can be no serious argument that the facts of this case, or the materials obtained\npursuant to the subpoena issued here, revealed Maxwell’s physical location over a period of time\nor are otherwise in any way analogous to the narrou category of information contemplated by the\nmajority in Carpenter. To the extent the defendant argues that her deposition transcripts implicate\nsuch interests because she “did not ‘voluntarily convey’ her testimony to <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>,” (Def. Mot. ll\n\n85\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o46", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003050.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll6 of 239\ncourt modified the protective order and issued a 26-page decision. The Government acted in\nreasonable reliance on the district court’s decision.\n\nThe defendant argues that the Government misled the Court when it “claimed not to knou\nwhat was in Boies Schiller’s file and that Boies Schiller had no role in instigating the investigation\nof Maxwell.” (Def. Mot. ll at l). The defendant’s claims are both factually inaccurate and\nmeritless.\n\nFirst, the Government did not mislead Chief Judge McMahon about its contacts with Boies\nSchiller. As an initial mater, Maxwell’s argument is premised solely on her use of selective\nsnippets from a lone Daily News Article that is premised, in meaningful part, on anonymous\nsources and hearsay. As the factual background set forth above—which is corroborated by notes\nand correspondence produced alongside this brief—makes clear, David Boies and Boies Schiller\nplayed no role in initiating, let alone “fomenting” the Government’s investigation. That\ninvestigation was opened more than two and a half years after the last knoun contact between any\nlawyer associated with any civil counsel for <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> and, in any event, was initially focused on\nEpstein, not this defendant. As detailed above, the USAO-SDNY opened the instant investigation\nin late November 2ol8 shortly after the Miami Herald published a series of articles about Epstein.\nAUSA-l was not involved in that decision, which in any event had nothing to do with a meeting\nthat had taken place nearly three years prior.*? (Ex. 4 at 6).\n°° Maxwell repeatedly claims that Boies Schiller urged AUSA-l to open an investigation of\nEpstein and Maxwell, (Def. Mot. 3 at 8), but that allegation, which is supported by nothing aside\nfrom the above-referenced media report, is incorrect. While AUSA-l did meet with the three\natorneys in February 2ol6, she understood the atorneys to be focused on Epstein, and not on\nEpstein and Maxwell as a “duo.” (Ex. 4 at l, 4). The presentation to AUSA-l focused on urging\nan investigation into Epstein with only passing references to Maxwell. Simply put, the pitch was\nto investigate Epstein, not Maxwell.\n\n89\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o5o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003056.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l22 of 239\n\nThe defendant asks the Court for a drastic remedy, namely suppression of a// evidence the\nGovernment obtained pursuant to the subpoena, as well as the dismissal of Counts Five and Six.\nIn so doing, the defendant seeks a windfall to which she is not entitled based on unprecedented\nclaims that ignore the facts and the law. Suppression of all materials the Government obtained\npursuant to the subpoena is unwarranted here, particularly where certain of the materials have been\nsubsequently unsealed by Judge Preska in the underlying civil litigation, including Maxwell’s\nApril 2ol6 deposition transcript. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. lo77). The Second Circuit\naffirmed Judge Preska’s ruling in October 2o2o, finding that the Court “correctly held that the\ndeposition materials are judicial documents to which the presumption of public access ataches,\nand did not abuse its discretion in rejecting Maxwell’s meritless arguments that her interests\nsuperseded the presumption of access.” <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> v. Maxwell, No. 2o-24l3 (2d Cir.), (Dkt. No. l4o-\nl at 3).” On October 22, 2o2o, the defendant’s April 2ol6 deposition was publicly filed. (See l5\nCiv. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. ll37-l3). In February 2o2l, a redacted version of the defendant’s July\n2ol6 deposition was publicly filed. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. l2l2-l). In other words,\nhad the Government not obtained an order modifying the protective order, the Government\ninevitably would have discovered and obtained, at a minimum, the defendant’s April 2ol6\ndeposition transcript and a portion of the July 2ol6 transcript that form the basis of the charges in\nCounts Five and Six.\n* Relatedly, the defendant moved to modify the criminal protective order in order to use\nconfidential criminal discovery materials in filings she intended to submit in civil litigation. The\ndefendant raised this precise point—that if the Court ultimately decided that it was inappropriate\nfor the Government to proceed by subpoena, the Government would claim inevitable discovery.\n(Dkt. No. 54 at 3). The defendant offered no coherent explanation of hou the criminal discovery\nmaterials could have any conceivable impact on the issues pending in civil litigation. She cited no\ncase law suggesting that, for example, the possibility of an inevitable discovery argument by the\nGovernment should foreclose unsealing in a civil case. This Court rejected the defendant’s motion\nto modify the criminal protective order. (Dkt. No. 5l). The Second Circuit also dismissed the\ndefendant’s appeal for want of jurisdiction. (Dkt. No. 7l).\n\n95\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o56", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003078.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l44 of 239\ntrial record—that the questions were fundamentally ambiguous, and the defendant’s answers were\ntruthful and immaterial. (Def. Mot. 5). To the contrary, the Government expects to prove at trial\nthat the defendant understood the questions and that her answers were both false and materially\nso. This case does not present the narrou circumstances in which a court can and should dismiss\nperjury counts, let alone do so before trial.\n\nA. Factual Background\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, follouing the USAO-SDFL entering into the non-prosecution agreement\nwith Epstein, two minors filed a petition under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C.\n§ 377l, alleging that the prosecutors violated their rights under that statute. See Doe v. United\nStates, o8 Civ. 8o736 (S.D.F.L). See generally Doe No. l. v. United States, 749 F.3d 999, loo2\n(llth Cir. 2ol4) (describing the background of the suit). On December 3o, 2ol4, Virginia Roberts\n<span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> moved to join the petition, alleging that the USAO-SDFL had also violated her CVRA\nrights. See Doe, No. o8 Civ. 8o736, Dkt. No. 279.*° In her motion for joinder, <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> described\nthe defendant as “‘one of the main women’ Epstein used to ‘procure under-aged girls for sexual\nactivities,’” and as a “‘primary co-conspirator’ with Epstein in his scheme. See <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> v. Maxwell,\nNo. l8-2868 (2d Cir. 2ol9), Dkt. No. 287 at lo (containing the unsealed summary judgment\nopinion from l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP)). Among other allegations, <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> alleged that the defendant\n“““nersuaded’ [her] to go to Epstein’s mansion,” and, “when <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> began giving Epstein a\nmassage, [he] and [the defendant] ‘turned it into a sexual encounter.’” /d. at ll. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> alleged\nthat the defendant also “‘participat[ed] in the sexual abuse’” of others. Jd. A few days later, the\npress reported a statement by a spokesman for the defendant, Ross Gou. Among other things,\n45 <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> filed a corrected motion on January 2, 2ol5. See Doe, No. o8 Civ. 8o736, Dkt. No. 28o.\nThe court later struck the original motion, sealed the corrected motion, and ordered filing of a\nredacted version of the corrected motion. See id., Dkt. No. 325 (Apr. 7, 2ol5).\n\nll7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o78", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003079.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l45 of 239\nGou stated that <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s claims were “untrue” and “obvious lies.” (l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt.\nNo. | at 6).\n\nAs described in the preceding section, in the fall of 2ol5, <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> sued the defendant for\ndefamation.*° (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. l). <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> alleged that Epstein sexually abused\nher, “with the assistance and participation of Maxwell” at “numerous locations” between l999 and\n2oo2, and that Epstein abused more than thirty minors between 2ool and 2oo7 “with the assistance\nof numerous co-conspirators.” (/d. at 3).\n\nDuring the defendant’s first deposition on April 22, 2ol6, the defendant refused to answer\nquestions that she deemed related to consensual adult sexual interactions. (See, e.g., Ex. lo at\n92:2o-93:6). <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> moved to compel the defendant to answer, explaining that “[a]t the core of\n[her] allegations is the allegation that [the] Defendant lured her into a sexual situation with the\noffer of a job making money as a massage therapist; that Epstein always habitually tried to turn\nmassages into sex .. . and that Maxwell recruited other females for an ostensibly proper position,\nsuch as therapeutic masseuse, with knouledge that the intent was for that person would be\npressured to provide sexual gratification to Epstein.” (l5 Civ. 7443 (LAP), Dkt. No. ll37-l at 5-\n6). <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> also explained that the defendant’s refusal to answer questions about adult consensual\nsex prevented <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> “from seeking legitimate discovery,” such as the identity of people the\ndefendant presently deemed adults. (/d. at 6).\n\nThe Court granted <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s motion. “[N]otwithstanding” the intrusiveness of the\nquestions and the fact that the defendant had not put her private affairs at issue, “the questions are\ndirected to reveal relevant answers regarding Defendant’s knouledge of Plaintiff’s allegations.”\n© The belou discussion is provided as context for the Court’s consideration of the motion. As\ndiscussed further in the Government’s opposition to the defendant’s motion for severance, the\nGovernment expects to provide a more streamlined presentation regarding the <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> suit at trial.\n\nll8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o79", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003080.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l46 of 239\n(Def. Mot. 4, Ex. H at 9). “That knouledge,” the Court explained, “goes directly to the truth or\nfalsity of the alleged defamation, a key element of Plaintiffs claim.” (/d.). The Court therefore\nordered the defendant to answer the questions related to her sexual activity with or involving (l)\nEpstein, (2) <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>, (3) underage girls knoun to Epstein or who she thought might become knoun\nto Epstein, or (4) involving massage with individuals the defendant “knew to be, or believed might\nbe, knoun to Epstein.” (/d. at lo). The Court further ordered the defendant to answer questions\nabout her knouledge of the sexual activities of others in the same four categories. The Court added\nthat the “scope of Defendant’s answers are not bound by time period, though Defendant need not\nanswer questions that relate to none of these subjects or that is clearly not relevant.” (/d.). The\ndefendant sat for a second deposition on July 22, 2ol6, before the case setled.\n\nAs discussed more fully belou, the Indictment charges the defendant with two counts of\nperjury, one arising from statements made during the April 2ol6 deposition and one arising from\nstatements made during the July 2ol6 deposition. Indictment 9 2l, 23. (Ex. lo at 253:25-254:8,\n384:l5-2o; Ex. ll at 88:9-89:l3, 9l:22-92:l6, ll3:2-l2). The defendant nou moves to dismiss\nboth counts, arguing that the Court can effectively decide nou, as a mater of law, that the questions\nwere fundamentally ambiguous, her answers were true, and her answers were immaterial to the\ncase.\n\nB. Applicable Law\n\nSection l623(a) imposes criminal penalties on anyone who “in any proceeding before or\nancillary to any court .. . knouingly makes any false material declaration.” l8 U.S.C. § l623(a).\nIn perjury prosecutions, “whether the witness believes that an answer is true or false generally\nturns on the declarant’s understanding of the question.” United States v. Lighte, 782 F.2d 367, 372\n(2d Cir. l986). Accordingly, and as is true of virtually all factual issues, “[a] jury is best equipped\n\nll9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o8o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003084.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5o of 239\njury.”). At this stage, the defendant must identify defects so fundamental that the charged\nstatements cannot, as a mater of law, support a perjury conviction. She has failed to do so, and\nher motion should be denied.\n\nl. April 2ol6 Deposition\n\nAt the April 2ol6 deposition, <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s counsel asked the defendant about hou <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>\ncame to Epstein’s home (Ex. lo at l4:9-l7:4), whether hired massage therapists engaged in sexual\nactivity with Epstein (id. at 5l:l3-55:l6), and the defendant’s knouledge of Epstein’s Florida\ncriminal case (id. at l7l:25-l73:l2, l83:25-l86:2l), among other topics. The transcript makes\nclear that when the defendant did not understand a question, she said so. (See, e.g., id. at 9:4-9\n(“[C]an you please clarify the question. I don’t understand what you mean by female, I don’t\nunderstand what you mean by recruit.”), 39:23-24 (“I don’t understand what your question is\nasking.”’), 94:l8-95:4 (“You don’t ask me questions like that. First of all, you are trying to trap\nme, I will not be trapped.’’), l38:6 (“Define relationship.”), 244:22-23 (“You are not asking me a\ngood question, sorry.’’).\n\nCount Five charges the defendant with perjury arising from two colloquies at this\ndeposition. First, <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s counsel asked the defendant a series of questions about whether the\ndefendant brought women to Epstein, which the defendant resisted by observing that she hired\n“people across the board” to “work for Jeffrey.” (Ud. at 245:7-l8). Guiuffre’s counsel asked\nwhether any minors worked as exercise instructors or masseuses at Epstein’s home, and the\ndefendant testified that they were all adults except for <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>, who she acknouledged at least\nclaimed to have been seventeen. (/d. at 246:l8-25l:l2). <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s counsel then asked questions\nabout whether Epstein had a “sexual preference for underage minors,” which drew objections from\n\nl23\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o84", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003085.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5l of 239\ndefense counsel and which the defendant ultimately answered by saying “I cannot tell you what\nJeffrey’s story is. I’m not able to.” (/d. at 25l:l3-253:l2). This colloquy folloued:\n\nQ. Did Jeffrey Epstein have a scheme to recruit underage girls to\nuse them for purposes of sexual massages?\nMR.

PAGLIUCA: Objection to the form and foundation.\nQ. If you knou.\nA. I don't knou what you are talking about.*®\n(Ex. lo at 253:l3-254:8).\n\nThe defendant argues that the question was ambiguous, as shoun by her requests for the\nquestioner to rephrase the question. (Def. Mot. 4 at 9-lo, l8). A properly instructed jury could\nreadily conclude otherwise in light of the evidence the Government expects to introduce at trial.\nThe defamation case involved allegations that <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> was a victim of that scheme: <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> had\nalleged that Epstein and the defendant had sexualized a massage that <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> gave Epstein. The\npreceding questions focused on (l) whether the defendant brought underage masseuses to work\nfor Epstein, and (2) whether Epstein had a sexual preference for underage girls. Moreover, at trial\nand as discussed further belou, the Government expects to elicit testimony from one or more of\n‘8 Underlined sentences are charged as false statements in the Indictment.\n\nl24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o85", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003086.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l52 of 239\n\nthe victims specified in the Indictment about sexualized massages the victims provided to Epstein,\nconduct that obviously predated the deposition. See Indictment { 7(a), (c). In context, and with an\nunderstanding of the Government’s other evidence, a rational juror could readily conclude that the\nquestion “did Jeffrey Epstein have a scheme to recruit underage girls for sexual massages . . . [i]f\nyou knou?” had a clear meaning, and more important for purposes of the instant motion, any\nambiguity was not “fundamental.” Cf Triumph Capital Grp., Inc., 237 F. App’x at 628\n(concluding that an answer about “this arrangement” was not fundamentally ambiguous).\n\nNor is there any basis to dismiss the count nou based on the defendant’s professed\nconfusion or denial of knouledge of the scheme’s existence. A defendant may commit perjury by\nfalsely denying memory or knouledge of an event. See, e.g., United States v. Alberti, 568 F.2d\n6l7, 625 (2d Cir. l977); United States v. Weiner, 479 F.2d 923, 926, 929 (2d Cir. l973); Forde,\n74o F. Supp. 2d at 4lo-ll. Viewing the question and answer “in the context of the line of\nquestioning as a whole,” the defendant “consistently denied” knouledge of Epstein’s scheme,\nMarkiewicz, 978 F.2d at 8lo, and a jury could conclude that the “question was not fundamentally\nambiguous—and thus that [the defendant], understanding the question, lied.” See Sampson, 898\nF.3d at 3o7; cf Indictment 4§ 4(e) ll(c)-(d), l7(c)-(d) (discussing use of massage as part of the\nsexual abuse scheme).\n\nSecond, later in the deposition, <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s counsel asked the defendant a series of questions\nin an atempt to identify other underage girls that the defendant met and brought to Epstein.\nSpecifically:\n\nQ. Can you list for me all the girls that you have met and brought to\nJeffrey Epstein’s house that were under the age of l8?\nMR.

See, e.g., Indictment\n§{ 7(a) (“MAXWELL subsequently interacted with Minor Victim-l on multiple occasions at\nEpstein’s residences.”). Accordingly, a rational juror, after hearing the evidence, could find that\nthe question called for the names of minors that the defendant interacted with at any of Jeffrey\nEpstein’s properties, that the defendant answered that she was aware of no such minors other than\n<span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>, and therefore that her answer was false. And even if the defendant identifies some\nplausible ambiguity—and she has not—the terms in this question are ones “with a meaning about\nwhich [people] of ordinary intellect could agree,” and therefore are not fundamentally ambiguous.\nLighte, 782 F.2d at 375 (internal quotation marks omited).\n\nThe defendant points out that, in response to an earlier question asking her to list the\nunderage girls she “met and brought” to Epstein’s house, she said that she could not do so. (Def.\nMot. 4 at l2-l3). She argues that the charged question was “improper” because it asked her to\ngenerate a list “from events that had happened nearly two decades previously.” (/d.). Her\nunpersuasive after-the-fact efforts to justify her answer provide no basis to keep this question from\nthe jury. As noted above, the transcript makes clear (and a jury could find) that when the defendant\ndid not understand or could not answer a question, she said so. To the extent the defendant is\narguing that her answer was literally true, a reasonable jury could find otherwise. In this respect,\nthe Government notes, among other things, that in response to the earlier question, the defendant\nsaid that she could not make a list not because she could not remember events from that long ago\nbut “because that list -- it never happened that I can think of.” (Ex. lo at 382:4-l3) (emphasis\nadded). And in response to the charged question, the defendant said that she “was not aware of\nanybody” under l8—that is, the list would be empty. See Forde, 74o F.

It was unclear, she\nexplains, what kind of massage the questioner meant. (Def. Mot. 4 at l7.) The defendant’s\nargument is, yet again, misguided. This line of questioning used broad language, and at no point\nduring this set of questions did <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s counsel suggest that the questions were limited to sexual\nor professional massages. Cf Lighte, 782 F.2d at 376 (concluding that the word “you” was\nambiguous when the prior two questions asked about the defendant “as an individual” and then\nswitched “without indication” to the defendant “as trustee”). The defendant’s answers were\nunequivocal, with no expressions of confusion or internal contradictions. Cf Markiewicz, 978\nF.2d at 8o9 (explaining that a question was ambiguous as to whether it asked about the deponent’s\npersonal or professional capacities, in light of the deponent’s confusion in the next questions). A\nproperly instructed jury could conclude that the defendant meant what she said: she never gave\nanyone a massage, including Epstein and Minor Victim-2.\n\nl34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o95", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003098.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l64 of 239\nstatements at the heart of that case and the evidence that might have been uncovered had the\ndefendant answered the questions truthfully. A jury should be alloued to hear the questions in\ncontext to evaluate their materiality, which cannot be done at this stage.*! The Court therefore\nshould deny the motion.\n\nIn any event, the perjurious statements were material in both senses of the definition. First,\nthe questions were aimed at developing a record in the civil suit that Epstein and the defendant\nrecruited <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> to Epstein’s Palm Beach property in the guise of hiring her as a masseuse, and\nthen sexualized that massage. Honest answers to those questions—for instance that Epstein in fact\nhad a scheme to recruit underaged girls for sexual massages—would have been corroborative of\nsome of <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s claims. Second, had the defendant honestly answered the deposition questions,\n<span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> could have located other victims or witnesses who may have corroborated her testimony.\nBut in any event, the question of materiality should be put to the jury and is inappropriate for the\nCourt to resolve on a motion to dismiss without the benefit of the full factual record.

I at 7:3-6.)\n(The last colloquy has been unsealed except for Minor Victim-2’s name. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP),\nDkt. No. l2l2-l).) Yet Judge Preska’s opinion as to the propriety of certain redactions in a civil\ncase is not controlling as to whether the Government can meet the elements of a criminal perjury\ncharge here. First, before Judge Preska were the defendant’s denials of various sexual activities,\nnot honest answers that would have been quite different. In part for that reason, Judge Sweet\nauthorized the deposition at the outset. Second, the Government was not a party to the civil\nunsealing litigation and did not have an opportunity to be heard on this issue before Judge Preska.\n>! While the Government is open to crafting a stipulation on the background of the <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> lawsuit\nto streamline presentation of these issues to the jury, it notes that the defendant’s summary of that\nsuit as set forth in her motion is incorrect. (£.g., Def. Mot. 4 at 2o (erroneously asserting that the\ndefamation claims at issue turned on <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s ability to prove salacious allegations about public\nofficials)).\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o98", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003105.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel7l of 239\ntherein. See Broccolo, 797 F. Supp. at ll9o-9l (joining counts involving use of businesses to\ncommit fraud with a count of falsely swearing in bankruptcy court that the defendant “had not\nengaged in any business activity during the preceding six years”).°? Accordingly, and consistent\nwith the holdings in Ruiz and Broccolo, this Court should deny the severance motion.\n\nThe defendant argues that the offenses are not connected because they involve different\ntime periods. To be sure, Counts One through Four charge conduct involving certain victims from\nl994 to l997, while the perjury counts charge statements made in 2ol6 in a case conceming\n<span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s abuse from l999 to 2oo2. Houever, the specific statements charged in Count Five and\nCount Six directly relate to the conduct charged in Counts One through Four, including, in one\ninstance, a specific victim identified as relevant to those counts. And those statements were not\ntime-bound or restricted to <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>. For instance, the defendant denied the existence of any scheme\nto recruit underage girls for sexual massages, not the existence of such a scheme between l999\nand 2oo2, or a scheme specifically focused on <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>. The defendant also denied ever giving\nanyone a massage, specifically including Epstein and Minor Victim-2. She did not limit her denial\nto <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> or to a particular time period. There is, accordingly, a strong connection between the\ntruth or falsity of the defendant’s broad denials and her acts in the period at issue in the substantive\ncounts. The cases on which the defendant relies are factually inapposite and do not support her\nargument, because they involve wholly unrelated events. See, e.g., United States v. Halper, 59o\nF.2d 422, 43l (2d Cir. l978) (severing a Medicaid fraud indictment from a tax evasion indictment\nwhere the only similarly was the defendant’s manipulation of people he had employed—different\n°3 While the defendant may argue that the fact that her deposition, unlike Ruiz, did not involve\ncriminal authorities counsels in favor of a different outcome, as discussed further belou, the\nprospect of a criminal prosecution was nonetheless plainly on her mind at the time of the\ndepositions, as evidenced by the myriad arguments she herself makes in support of her motions to\nsuppress the fruits of the grand jury subpoena to Boies Schiller. (See, e.g., Def. Mot. 3 at 3-4, Def.\nMot. ll at 2).\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3lo5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003108.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l74 of 239\nof proof of the conspiracy and perjury crimes permited joinder of the offenses . . . and denial of\nappellant’s Rule l4 pretrial motion for severance.”); Pizarro, 2ol8 WL l737236, at *6-*7.\n\nThe defendant argues that the trial on the perjury counts will require a “full-bloun re-\nlitigation of the defamation action.” (Def. Mot. 5 at 9). That is a significant exaggeration. To\nlitigate the perjury counts, the parties will need to present evidence about the basic substance of\nthe civil suit—in particular, <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s allegations and the defendant’s denials—such that the jury\nwill be able to assess materiality and the statements’ context. This can be done briefly—as stated\nin Section V, the Government is amenable to presenting that information through a stipulation—\nand, in any event, through minimal additional evidence. The stipulation or other evidence could\nbe crafted to minimize the risk of spillover prejudice, for instance by referring to <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> by a\npseudonym to avoid any connection she might have to testimony on the substantive counts. And\nany remaining prejudice could be vitiated by a limiting instruction that the jury should not consider\n<span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s allegations as evidence of the substantive counts. See Page, 657 F.3d at l3o-3l\n(approving of similar precautions when introducing evidence of a defendant’s prior felony\nconviction); Pizarro, 2ol8 WL l737236, at *7; see also Zafiro, 5o6 U.S. at 54o (“[JJuries are\npresumed to follou their instructions.” (citation and internal quotation marks omited)). There is\nevery reason to think a jury could and would follou such an instruction. See, e.g., Rivera, 546\nF.3d at 254 (using a limiting instruction to prevent spillover prejudice for counts involving the\nsexual exploitation of different children, especially in light of admissibility across counts); United\nStates v. Pena, 932 F. Supp. 2d 464, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (using a limiting instruction to address\nspillover prejudice from two murder for hire conspiracies). Indeed, even if the counts were\nsevered, as noted above, the Government would still seek to offer evidence of the defendant’s false\ndenials of conduct relevant to Counts One through Four as evidence of her consciousness of guilt\n\nl47\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3lo8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003109.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l75 of 239\n\nas to those counts, and would consent to a similar limiting instruction, which a jury would be\npresumed to follou. And, of course, in a severed trial exclusively on the perjury counts, the\ndefendant would surely argue that a limiting instruction is necessary to prevent the jury from\nconcluding that the defendant’s statements were false based in part on the substance of <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s\nunproven allegations. Just as a jury would set aside the substance of <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s allegations for that\npurpose, so can the jury set aside the substance of <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s allegations for Counts One through\nFour.\n\nThe defendant contends instead that the perjury counts require a “collateral trial” on the\ntruth of <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s statements and resolution of “more than 5o substantive motions . . . pending\nbefore the District Court.” (Def. Mot. 5 at 9-lo). As described in Section V, a false statement in\na civil deposition is material (l) if a “truthful answer might reasonably be calculated to lead to the\ndiscovery of evidence admissible at the trial of the underlying suit,” United States v. Kross, l4\nF.3d 75l, 753 (2d Cir. l994), or (2) if it has “a natural tendency to influence, or [be] capable of\ninfluencing, the decision of the decisionmaking body to which it was addressed,” United States v.\nGaudin, 5l5 U.S. 5o6, 5o9 (l995) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omited).\nNeither of these standards requires the jury to determine whether the defendant’s statements would\nhave tipped the scales in the defamation suit or would likely have led to the discovery of evidence.\nSee Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 77l (l988) (“It has never been the test of materiality\nthat the misrepresentation or concealment would more likely than not have produced an erroneous\ndecision, or even that it would more likely than not have triggered an investigation.”); United States\nv.

Although the government aspires to present “a more streamlined\npresentation” at trial (Resp. ll8 fn. 46), it is unlikely to meet this goal. What follous is a very\ntruncated discussion of some of the facts to place the questions and answers in Ms. Maxwell’s\ndepositions from that civil action in context:\n\nI. The Defamation Action\n\nIn 2oo8, two alleged Epstein victims brought an action under the Crime Victims’ Rights\nAct (CVRA) against the United States government purporting to challenge Epstein’s plea\nagreement. They alleged the government violated their CVRA rights by entering into the\nagreement.\n\nSeven years later, on December 3o, 2ol4, Ms. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> moved to join the CVRA action,\nclaiming she too had her CVRA rights violated by the government. On January l, 2ol5, Ms.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> filed a “corrected” joinder motion. The issue presented in her joinder motion was\nnarrou: whether she should be permited to join the CVRA action as a party under Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 2l, specifically, whether she was a “knoun victim[] of Mr. Epstein and the\nGovernment oued them CVRA duties,” Ex. L at 5. Yet, the court noted, “the bulk of the\n[motion] consists of copious factual details that [<span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>] and [her co-movant] ‘would prove . . .\nif alloued to join.’” /d. (brackets omited). Ms. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> gratuitously included provocative and\n“lurid details” of her alleged sexual activities as an alleged victim of sexual trafficking. Jd.\n\nAt the time they filed the motion, Ms. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> and her lawyers knew that the media had\nbeen follouing the Epstein criminal case and the CVRA action. While they deliberately filed the\nmotion without disclosing Ms. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s name, claiming the need for privacy and secrecy, they\nmade no atempt to file the motion under seal. Quite the contrary, they filed the motion publicly.\nAs the district court noted in ruling on the joinder motion, Ms. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> “name[d] several\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo37l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003714.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page6ofl6\nindividuals, and she offers details about the type of sex acts performed and where they took\nplace.” Ex. L at 5. The court ruled the lurid details are unnecessary”: “The factual details\nregarding whom and where the Jane Does engaged in sexual activities are immaterial and\nimpertinent . . ., especially considering that these details involve non-parties who are not related\nto the respondent Government.” Jd. Accordingly, “[t]hese unnecessary details shall be stricken.”\nId. The court then struck all Ms. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s factual allegations relating to her alleged sexual\nactivities and her allegations of misconduct by non-parties. /d. at 5-6. The court said the striking\nof the “lurid details” was a sanction for Ms. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s improper inclusion of them in her motion.\nSee id. at 6-7. The district court found not only that the “lurid details” were unnecessary but also\nthat the entire joider motion was “entirely unnecessary.” /d. at 7.\n\nMs. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> and her lawyers knew the motion with all its “lurid details” was unnecessary\nbecause, as the court pointed out, the motion itself recognized that she would be able to\nparticipate as a fact witness to achieve the same result she sought as a party. See id. at 7-8; see\nalso id. at 8 (noting that in the motion, Ms. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s lawyers said that “regardless of whether\nthis Court grants the .. . Motion, ‘they will call [her] as a witness at any trial’”’). The court\ndenied <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s joinder motion. /d. at lo. One of the non-parties Ms. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> “named”\nrepeatedly in the joinder motion was Ms. Maxwell. Ex. M, at 3-6. According to the “lurid\ndetails” Ms. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> included in the motion, Ms. Maxwell personally was involved in a “sexual\nabuse and sex trafficking scheme” created by Epstein:\n\n° Ms. Maxwell “approached” <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> in l999 when <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> was “fifteen years old” to\nrecruit her into the scheme. /d. at 3.\n& Ms. Maxwell was “one of the main women” Epstein used to “procure under-aged\ngirls for sexual activities.” Id.\n« Ms. Maxwell was a “primary co-conspirator’ with Epstein in his scheme.

The government’s secrecy, <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> alleged, was motivated by\nits fear that <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> would raise “pouerful objections” to the agreement that would have “shed\ntremendous public light on Epstein and other pouerful individuals.” Jd. at 6-7.\n\nAs <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> and her lawyers expected, before District Judge Marra in the CVRA action\ncould strike the “lurid details” of <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s allegations in the joinder motion, members of the\nmedia obtained copies of the motion, printed the “lurid” details in tabloid news publications, and\nsought comment from Ms. Maxwell, Professor Dershouitz and others.\n\nOn January 2, 2ol5, UK lawyers for Ms. Maxwell sent representatives of British media\norganizations an email containing “a quotable statement on behalf of Ms. Maxwell.” The email\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo37l5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003716.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8ofl6\nwas sent to more than 6 and probably less than 3o media representatives. The email to the media\nmembers read:\n\nTo Whom It May Concern,\n\nPlease find atached a quotable statement on behalf of Ms. Maxwell. No further\n\ncommunication will be provided by her on this mater.\n\nThanks for your understanding.\n\nBest\n\nRoss\n\nRoss Gou\n\nACUITY Reputation\n\nJane Doe 3 is Virginia Roberts—so not a new individual. The allegations made by\n\nVictoria Roberts against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue. The original allegations\n\nare not new and have been fully responded to and shoun to be untrue.\n\nEach time the story is re told [sic] it changes with new salacious details about\n\npublic figures and world leaders and nou it is alleged by Ms Roberts [sic] that\n\nAlan Derschouitz [sic] is involved in having sexual relations with her, which he\n\ndenies.\n\nMs Roberts claims are obvious lies and should be treated as such and not\n\npublicised as news, as they are defamatory.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell’s original response to the lies and defamatory claims remains\n\nthe same. Maxwell strongly denies allegations of an unsavoury nature, which\n\nhave appeared in the British press and elsewhere and reserves her right to seek\n\nredress at the repetition of such old defamatory claims.\n\nEx. N.\n\nEight years after Epstein’s guilty plea, <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> brought the defamation action, repeating\nmany of the allegations she made in her CVRA joinder motion. The complaint alleged that the\nJanuary 2ol5 statement “contained the follouing deliberate falsehoods”:\n\n(a) That <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s sworn allegations “against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue.”\n\n(b) That the allegations have been “shoun to be untrue.”\n\n(c) That <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s “claims are obvious lies.”\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo37l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003717.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 9ofl6\n\nThe defamation litigation was legally very complicated and New York law afforded\nmany statutory, common law, and constitutional defenses to Ms. Maxwell (which may become\nrelevant at another time). In addition to strong legal defenses Ms. Maxwell’s defense of truth was\nexceptional. It was clear that given the wording of Mr. Gou’s statement, proof of falsity of one\nor more of <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s claims would be enough to defeat the civil action. Very quickly there were\nmany provable “obvious lies.” A few examples:\n\ne Contrary to her claim of “slavery,” <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> lived independently from her parents with her\nfiance long before meeting Epstein or Ms. Maxwell and held a number of jobs in 2ool\nand 2oo2.\n\ne <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s employment at the Mar-a-Lago spa began in fall 2ooo when she was l7, not l5.\n(This falsity was important to <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s story for many reasons.)\n\ne Palm Beach Police investigation revealed no evidence that Ms. Maxwell was involved in\nsexual abuse of minors, sexual trafficking or production or possession of child\npornography.\n\ne No nude photograph of <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> was displayed in Epstein’s home.\n\ne <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s tales about foreign presidents and prime ministers were untrue.\n\ne All ofthe famous people <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> claimed to have been sexually trafficked to denied these\nclaims, which were completely implausible.\n\nImportantly, <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> post-dates the allegations contained in the superseding indictment\n(“Indictment”) by three years. By her claims, and admissions, she did not meet Epstein until\n2ooo, long after the accusers named in the Indictment. Her strong connection with these accusers\ndeveloped through her lawyers who likely represent at least two of the accusers and some of the\nwitnesses.\n\nVirtually every issue in the defamation action was contested. A review of the docket,\nunfortunately, reflects over one-thousand entries. The parties disagreed about the scope and\nmeaning of virtually all of Judge Sweet’s discovery orders, including those related to Ms.\nMaxwell’s depositions. Significantly, Judge Sweet’s Order prefaced all the listed categories with\nthe words “sexual activity” an “sexual activities.”\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo37l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003737.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8-2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page2ofl5\nCase 9:o8-cv-8o736-KAM Document 28o Entered on FLSD Docket ol/o2/2ol5 Page l of l4\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA\nCase No. o8-8o736-Civ-Marra/Johnson\nJANE DOE #l and JANE DOE #2\nv.\nUNITED STATES /\nJANE DOE #3 AND JANE DOE #4’s CORRECTED MOTION PURSUANT TO RULE 2l\nFOR JOINDER IN ACTION\nCOME NOW Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4 (also referred to as “the new victims”), by and\nthrough undersigned counsel, to file this motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 2l\nto join this action, on the condition that they not re-litigate any issues already litigated by Jane\nDoe #l and Jane Doe #2 (also referred to as “the current victims”).

She alleged that Jeffrey Epstein had sexually abused her and that the United States had\nentered into a secret non-prosecution agreement (NPA) regarding those crimes in violation of her\nrights. At the first court hearing on the case, the Court alloued Jane Doe #2 to also join the\naction. Both Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2 specifically argued that the government had failed to\nprotect their CVRA rights (inter alia) to confer, to reasonable notice, and to be treated with\nfairness. In response, the Government argued that the CVRA rights did not apply to Jane Doe #l\nand Jane Doe #2 because no federal charges had ever been filed against Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe Court has firmly rejected the United States’ position. In a detailed ruling, the Court\nconcluded that the CVRA extended rights to Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2 even though federal\ncharges were never filed. DE l89, The Court explained that because the NPA barred\nprosecution of crimes commited against them by Epstein, they had “standing” to assert\nviolations of the CVRA rights. Jd. The Court deferred ruling on whether the two victims would\nbe entitled to relief, pending development of a fuller evidentiary record. Jd.\n\nTwo other victims, who are in many respects similarly situated to the current victims,\nnou wish to join this action.

The Government then concealed from Jane Doe #3 the existence of its NPA from Jane\nDoe #3, in violation of her rights under the CVRA, If alloued to join this action, Jane Doe #3\nwould prove the follouing:\n\nIn l999, Jane Doe #3 was approached by Ghislaine Maxwell, one of the main women\nwhom Epstein used to procure under-aged girls for sexual activities and a primary co-conspirator\nin his sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme. In fact, it became knoun to the government that\nMaxwell herself regularly participated in Epstein’s sexual exploitation of minors, including Jane\nDoe #3. Maxwell persuaded Jane Doe #3 (who was then fifteen years old) to come to Epstein’s\nmansion in a fashion very similar to the manner in which Epstein and his other co-conspirators\ncoerced dozens of other children (including Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2). When Jane Doe #3\nbegan giving Epstein a “massage,” Epstein and Maxwell turned it into a sexual encounter, as\nthey had done with many other victims. Epstein then became enamored with Jane Doe #3, and\nwith the assistance of Maxwell converted her into what is commonly referred to as a “sex slave.”\nEpstein kept Jane Doe #3 as his sex slave from about l999 through 2oo2, when she managed to\nescape to a foreign country and hide out from Epstein and his co-conspirators for years. From\nl999 through 2oo2, Epstein frequently sexually abused Jane Doe #3, not only in West Palm\nBeach, but also in New York, New Mexico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, in international airspace on\nhis Epstein’s private planes, and elsewhere.\n\nEpstein also sexually trafficked the then-minor Jane Doe, making her available for sex to\npolitically-connected and financially-pouerful people. Epstein’s purposes in “lending” Jane Doe\n(along with other young girls) to such pouerful people were to ingratiate himself with them for\n\n3\n<span class=\"highlight\">GIUFFRE</span> oo429o\nCONFIDENTIAL\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3739", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003740.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8-2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page5ofl5\nCase 9:o8-cv-8o736-KAM Document 28o Entered on FLSD Docket ol/o2/2ol5 Page 4 of l4\nbusiness, personal, political, and financial gain, as well as to obtain potential blackmail\ninformation.\n\nOne such pouerful individual that Epstein forced then-minor Jane Doe #3 to have sexual\nrelations with was former Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershouitz, a close friend of Epstein’s\nand well-knoun criminal defense atorney. Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to have sexual\nrelations with Dershouitz on numerous occasions while she was a minor, not only in Florida but\nalso on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In addition to\nbeing a participant in the abuse of Jane Doe #3 and other minors, Deshouitz was an eye-witness\nto the sexual abuse of many other minors by Epstein and several of Epstein’s co-conspirators.\nDershouitz would later play a significant role in negotiating the NPA on Epstein’s behalf.\nIndeed, Dershouitz helped negotiate an agreement that provided immunity from federal\nprosecution in the Southern District of Florida not only to Epstein, but also to “any potential co-\nconspirators of Epstein.” NPA at 5. Thus, Dershouitz helped negotiate an agreement with a\nprovision that provided protection for himself against criminal prosecution in Florida for\nsexually abusing Jane Doe #3. Because this broad immunity would have been controversial if\ndisclosed, Dershouitz (along with other members of Epstein’s defense team) and the\nGovernment tried to keep the immunity provision secret from all of Epstein’s victims and the\ngeneral public, even though such secrecy violated the Crime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell was another person in Epstein’s inner circle and a co-conspirator in\nEpstein’s sexual abuse. She was someone who consequently also appreciated the immunity\ngranted by the NPA for the crimes she commited in Florida. In addition to participating in the\nsexual abuse of Jane Doe #3 and others, Maxwell also took numerous sexually explicit pictures\n\n4\n<span class=\"highlight\">GIUFFRE</span> oo429l\nCONFIDENTIAL\nDOJ-OGR-oooo374o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003741.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8-2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page6ofl5\nCase 9:o8-cv-8o736-KAM Document 28o Entered on FLSD Docket ol/o2/2ol5 Page 5 of l4\nof underage girls involved in sexual activities, including Jane Doe #3. She shared these\nphotographs (which constituted child pornography under applicable federal laws) with Epstein.\nThe Government is apparently aware of, and in certain instances possesses some of these\nphotographs.\n\nPerhaps even more important to her role in Epstein’s sexual abuse ring, Maxwell had\ndirect connections to other pouerful individuals with whom she could connect Epstein. For\ninstance, one such pouerful individual Epstein forced Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with\nwas a member of the British Royal Family, Prince Andrew (a/k/a Duke of York). Jane Doe #3\nwas forced to have sexual relations with this Prince when she was a minor in three separate\ngeographical locations: in London (at Ghislaine Maxwell’s apartment), in New York, and on\nEpstein’s private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands (in an orgy with numerous other under-aged\ngirls). Epstein instructed Jane Doe #3 that she was to give the Prince whatever he demanded and\nrequired Jane Doe #3 to report back to him on the details of the sexual abuse. Maxwell\nfacilitated Prince Andrew’s acts of sexual abuse by acting as a “madame” for Epstein, thereby\nassisting in internationally trafficking Jane Doe #3 (and numerous other young girls) for sexual\npurposes.\n\nAnother person in Epstein’s inner circle of friends (who becomes apparent with almost\nno investigative effort) is Jean Luc Brunel. Epstein sexually trafficked Jane Doe #3 to Jean Luc\nBrunel many times. Brunel was another of Epstein’s closest friends and a regular traveling\ncompanion, who had many contacts with young girls throughout the world.

Epstein also forced Jane Doe #3 to have sex with\nBrunel on numerous occasions, at places including Epstein’s mansion in West Palm Beach, Litle\nSt. James Island in the U.S. Virgin Islands (many including orgies that were comprised of other\nunderage girls), New York City, New Mexico, Paris, the south of France, and California.\n\nEpstein also trafficked Jane Doe #3 for sexual purposes to many other pouerful men,\nincluding numerous prominent American politicians, pouerful business executives, foreign\npresidents, a well-knoun Prime Minister, and other world leaders. Epstein required Jane Doe #3\nto describe the events that she had with these men so that he could potentially blackmail them.\n\nThe Government was well aware of Jane Doe #3 when it was negotiating the NPA, as it\nlisted her as a victim in the atachment to the NPA. Moreover, even a rudimentary investigation\nof Jane Doe #3’s relationship to Epstein would have revealed the fact that she had been\ntrafficked throughout the United States and internationally for sexual purposes. Nonetheless, the\nGovernment secretly negotiated a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein precluding any\nFederal prosecution in the Southern District of Florida of Epstein and his co-conspirators. As\nwith Jane Doe #l, and Jane Doe #2, the Government concealed the non-prosecution agreement\nfrom Jane Doe #3 — all in violation of her rights under the CVRA — to avoid Jane Doe #3 from\nraising pouerful objections to the NPA that would have shed tremendous public light on Epstein\n\n6\n<span class=\"highlight\">GIUFFRE</span> oo4293\nCONFIDENTIAL\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3742", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003743.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8-2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8ofl5\nCase 9:o8-cv-8o736-KAM Document 28o Entered on FLSD Docket ol/o2/2ol5 Page 7 of l4\nand other pouerful individuals and that would likely have been prevented it from being\nconcluded in the secretive manner in which it was.\nJane Doe #4’s Circumstances\n\nIf permited to join this action, Jane Doe #4 would allege, and could prove at trial, that\nshe has CVRA claims similar to those advanced by Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2, based on the\nfollouing:\n\nAs with the other Jane Does, Jane Doe #4 was repeatedly sexually abused by Epstein. In\nor around the summer of 2oo2, Jane Doe #4, an economically poor and vulnerable sixteen-year-\nold child, was told by another one of Epstein’s underage minor sex abuse victims, that she could\nmake $3oo cash by giving an old man a massage on Palm Beach. An acquaintance of Jane Doe\n#4 (also a minor sexual abuse victim of Epstein) telephoned Epstein and scheduled Jane Doe #4\nto go to Epstein’s house to give him a massage. During that call, Epstein himself got on the\nphone (a means of interstate communication) with Jane Doe #4, asking her personally to come to\nhis mansion in Palm Beach.\n\nJane Doe #4 then went to Epstein’s mansion and was escorted upstairs to Epstein’s large\nbathroom by one of Epstein’s assistants. Shortly thereafter Jeffrey Epstein emerged and Jay face\ndoun on the table and told Jane Doe #4 to start massaging him. Epstein asked Jane Doe #3 her\nage and she told him she had recently turned sixteen. Epstein subsequently commited illegal\nsexual acts against Jane Doe #4 on many occasions.\n\nEpstein used a means of interstate communication (i.e., a cell phone) to arrange for these\nsexual encounters. Epstein also frequently travelled in interstate commerce (i.e., on his personal\njet) for purposes of illegally sexually abusing Jane Doe #4.\n\n7\n<span class=\"highlight\">GIUFFRE</span> oo4294\nCONFIDENTIAL\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3743", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003744.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8-2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page9ofl5\nCase 9:o8-cv-8o736-KAM Document 28o Entered on FLSD Docket ol/o2/2ol5 Page 8 of l4\n\nThe acts Epstein commited against Jane Doe #4, constituted numerous federal sex\noffenses, some of which do not carry a statute of limitations and thus are not time-barred. See l8\nU.S.C. § 3283. And these offenses were the kinds of offenses that the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI) and U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida were pursuing\nin 2oo7. So far as Jane Doe #4 is aware, the U.S. Atorney’s Office made no serious effort to\nlocate her. Instead, after identifying approximately forty separate underage sexually abused\nvictims, and apparently preparing a 53-page federal indictment and with full awareness of the\nexistence of many victims like Jane Doe #4 — unidentified and not interviewed — it entered into a\nnon-prosecution agreement barring prosecution of Epstein’s federal crimes against these victims.\nThis is contrary to the Government’s normal approach in prosecuting federal sex offenses. It\nalso violated Jane Doe #4’s rights under the CVRA, including the fact that she had a\n“reasonable” right to confer with the U.S. Atorney’s Office before they entered into an\nagreement with a sex offender barring prosecution of him for the crimes he commited against\nher. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(5).\n\nMOTION FOR JOINDER\n\nJane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4 nou both move to join this action filed by Jane Doe #l and\nJane Doe #2, pursuant to Rule 2l of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

The new victims’ participation in this\ncase is important because it appears that the Government intends to raise a factual defense that\nsomehou it did keep Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2 properly informed of what was happening in\nthe criminal prosecution. Of course, if four victims all testify consistently that they were not\nproperly informed by the Government (as we believe they will), that provides a stronger case for\na CVRA violation.\nIn addition, Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4’s participation is relevant to a defense the\nCourt has alloued the Government to raise. The Court has previously ruled that the victims’\nrequest for rescission of the NPA “implicates a fact-sensitive equitable defense which must be\nconsidered in the historical factual context of the entire interface between Epstein, the relevant\nprosecutorial authorities and the federal offense victims — including an assessment of the\nallegation of a deliberate conspiracy between Epstein and federal prosecutors to keep the victims\nin the dark on the pendency of negotiations between Epstein and federal authorities until well\nafter the fact and presentation of the non-prosecution agreement to them as a fait accompli.” DE\nl89 at l2 n.6 (emphasis added). Jane Doe #3’s and Jane Doe #4’s participation in this case will\nhelp to shou what the “entire interface” was between the Government and the victims and thus\nto respond to the Government’s estoppel arguments as well as other defenses that it appears to be\npreparing to raise. See, e.g., DE 62 (52-page response from the Government to the victim’s\nsummary judgment motion, raising numerous factually-based and other arguments against the\nvictim’s position).\n9\n<span class=\"highlight\">GIUFFRE</span> oo4296\nCONFIDENTIAL\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3745", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003746.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8-2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page llofl5\nCase 9:o8-cv-8o736-KAM Document 28o Entered on FLSD Docket ol/o2/2ol5 Page lo of l4\n\nJane Doe #3’s and Jane Doe #4’s participation is also directly relevant to the discovery\ndisputes currently pending in this case. The Government has raised various relevancy objections\nto the documents that Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2 are atempting to obtain. The current\nvictims have responded by explaining hou these documents are relevant, including explaining\nhou these documents might bear on the way in which Epstein used his pouerful political and\nsocial connections to secure a favorable plea deal, as well as provide proof of the Government’s\nmotive to deliberately fail to investigate certain aspects of the victims’ claims in an effort to\nmaintain the secrecy of the facts and resolve the case without the victims’ knouledge. See, e.g.,\n\nDE 266 at 6-lo. Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4’s participation will help prove the relevancy of\nthese requests, as well as the need for those requests.\n\nOne clear example is Request for Production No. 8, which seeks documents regarding\nEpstein’s lobbying efforts to persuade the Government to give him a more favorable plea\narrangement and/or non-prosecution agreement, including efforts on his behalf by Prince\nAndrew and former Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershouitz. Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2\nhave alleged these materials are needed to prove their allegations that, after Epstein signed the\nnon-prosecution agreement, his performance was delayed while he used his significant social and\npolitical connections to lobby the Justice Department to obtain a more favorable plea deal. See,\n\ne.g., DE 225 at 7-8 (discussing DE 48 at l6-l8). Jane Doe #3 has directly person knouledge of\nEpstein’s connection with some of these pouerful! people and thus hou Epstein might have used\nthem to secure favorable treatment.\n\nAdding two new victims to this case will not delay any of the proceedings.

As the court is aware, this\nCourt is still in its initial discovery stage. The Court is currently considering whether to reject\nthe Government’s assertion of privilege over documents regarding the case. See DE 265\n(victims’ reassertion of objections to the Government privilege claims). The new victims do not\nseek any additional discovery beyond that previously sought by the current victims.”\nAccordingly, the United States will not be prejudiced or burdened by adding them to this case.\n\nThe CVRA does not contain any statute of limitations for filing an action to enforce\nrights under the statute. Accordingly, were the Court to deny this motion, the result might be\nthat the new victims would then be forced to file a separate suit raising their claims, which would\nthen possibly proceed on a separate litigation track. Rather than require duplicative litigation,\nthe Court should simply grant their motion to join.\n\nJane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2 support the joinder motion. Counsel for the victims have\ndiscussed this motion with the Government at length in an effort to avoid any need to file a\nsubstantive pleading on the issue. Counsel for the victims asked the Government during the\nsummer for its position on joinder. The Government, houever, took the mater under\nadvisement for months. Ultimately, after several inquiries from victims counsel, the\nGovernment indicated without explanation that it opposes this motion. Counsel for the victims\nhas requested a meeting with the Government on this issue, which will hopefully occur in\n\n2 Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4 have asked the Government to provide them with the\nrecord of their statements that they provided to the FBI.

The Government thus is not asking\n\nfor a straightforward application of the third-party doctrine, but instead a significant\n\nextension of it to a distinct category of information.\n\nId. at 22l9. Second, the Court concluded that in “in no meaningful sense” did Carpenter\nvoluntarily “assume the risk” of “turning over a comprehensive dossier of his physical\nmovements.” /d. at 222o.\n\nThe same logic applies here. There is “world of difference between the limited types of\npersonal information addressed in Smith and Miller and the exhaustive” and personal details\nabout Maxwell that are contained in Boies Schiller’s 9o,ooo pages of confidential material.\nThese details include, for example, information about Maxwell’s sexual partners, sexual habits,\nfinances, and much, much more.\n\nMoreover, “in no meaningful sense” did Maxwell voluntarily share this information with\nBoies Schiller. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> sued Maxwell, not the other way around. And the defamation claim (the\nonly claim <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> ever asserted against Maxwell, who did not file a counterclaim) had nothing\nto do with much of the confidential information Maxwell was forced, over objection, to provide.\nMaxwell’s motion to dismiss the perjury counts for lack of materiality and her motion for\nseverance, and the replies in support thereof, explain this in more detail. Maxwell Pre-Trial Mot.\nNos. 4 & 5.\n\nBut the point is this: The defamation case should have been extremely narrou, but Boies\nSchiller transformed it into something much broader—a proxy prosecution of Epstein and\nMaxwell for allegedly trafficking and abusing <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>, which then compelled Maxwell, over\nobjection, to answer irrelevant and highly prejudicial personal questions. None of it was\nvoluntary.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3782", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003784.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo of 2o\n\nB. There is no good faith.\n\nThe rebutal to government’s good faith claim is simple: There can be no good faith\nwhen the government willfully and intentionally misleads the court into authorizing its search.\nAs the United States Supreme Court held in United States v. Leon,\n\nSuppression . . . remains an appropriate remedy if the magistrate or judge in issuing\n\na warrant was misled by information in an affidavit that the affiant knew was false\n\nor would have knoun was false except for his reckless disregard of the truth.\n\n468 U.S. 897, 923 (l984).\n\nHere, as explained in Maxwell’s due process motion to suppress and the reply in support\nthereof, the government misled Chief Judge McMahon to modify the <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> Protective Order\nand authorize the subpoena to Boies Schiller. The good faith doctrine does not apply when the\ngovernment acts in objective bad faith.\n\nC. The government’s inevitable discovery doctrine fails.\n\nThere are several reasons the government’s inevitable discovery argument fails.\n\nFirst, the inevitable discovery doctrine is an exception to the Fourth Amendment’s\nexclusionary rule. United States v. Stokes, 733 F.3d 438, 442—43 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (reversing\ndistrict court’s denial of motion to suppress, which was based on “the inevitable discovery\ndoctrine, an exception to the Fourth Amendment's exclusionary rule”). The doctrine has no\napplicability when a court exercises its inherent or supervisory authority to suppress evidence\nobtained through deliberate government misconduct. The exercise of that authority is meant to\nvindicate the dignity of the Court and to deter improper governmental conduct. See United States\nv. Cortina, 63o F.2d l2o7, l2l6 (7th Cir. l98o) (“The need for deterrence of illegal conduct is,\nin one sense, greater here than [elsewhere], for [the government’s] offense was commited within\nthe sanctity of the court itself.”).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3784", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003785.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagell of 2o\n\nSecond, the government’s inevitable discovery doctrine is far too speculative. The\n“typical application” of the inevitable discovery doctrine is when “the government seeks to\ninvoke the doctrine on the basis of standardized, established procedures such as those requiring\ninventory searches.” Stokes, 733 F.3d at 447. The government’s “inevitability analysis in this\ncase,” houever, “is predicated on an assessment of the actions that might have been taken by\nthird parties,” such as Judge Preska and the Miami Herald, who are “not acting at the behest of\nthe police.” /d. “Such an analysis is inherently speculative.” Jd.\n\nIn fact, unlike every other civil case in the Southern District of New York against\nMaxwell or Epstein’s estate, the government deliberately chose not to intervene in the on-going\nunsealing process in <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> v. Maxwell. In the only other active SDNY case against Epstein,\nDoe v. Indyke, No. 2o-cv-484-JLK, the government intervened and moved to stay discovery,\nsaying that continued discovery could threaten its case against Maxwell.\n\nBy contrast, the government opted not to intervene and stay the unsealing in <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> v.\nMaxwell. The reason is obvious. Legitimately concerned about the propriety of its conduct in\nmisleading Chief Judge McMahon and issuing an unconstitutionally overbroad subpoena to\nBoies Schiller, the government hoped to hedge its bets by allouing the unsealing process to\nunfold so it could make the inevitable discovery argument it nou makes. This Court should not\ncondone such gamesmanship.!\n\nThird, the government’s inevitable discovery argument is far too broad. Even the\ngovernment admits that the vast majority of material it obtained from Boies Schiller is not on the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> v. Maxwell docket and has not been unsealed by Judge Preska. Resp. at 94. In fact, the\ngovernment’s response appears to concede that its inevitable discovery argument is limited to\n\n' As the government recognizes, Judge Preska recognized this possibility, but deferred to this\nCourt on the question since it is presiding over the criminal case. Resp. at 94 n.4l.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3785", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003788.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel4 of 2o\n\nBut that’s doubtless because that law has been clear for forty-two years that the\ngovernment can modify a civil Protective Order and then subpoena confidential material on/y\nafter notice to the real party in interest and an opportunity to respond. Martindell, 594 F.2d at\n294 (Martindell decided in l979). The proper procedure for modifying a civil Protective Order at\nthe government’s request, in other words, is the one that affords due process. U.S. CONST.\namend. V.\n\nThat no case has addressed the remedy for a Martindell violation is evidence only of (l)\nthe government’s prior compliance with Martindell (which should, of course, be expected), or\n(2) a criminal defendant having not raised the issue before. In this case, houever, (l) the\ngovernment violated Martindell, and (2) Maxwell seeks suppression as a sanction.\n\nSuppression is the proper remedy for at least two reasons. First, at its heart, Martindell is\ngrounded in due process principles, and the government’s conduct here violated Maxwell’s right\nto due process. See U.S. CONST. amend. V. The essence of due process is notice and an\nopportunity to be heard. Martindell guaranteed Maxwell notice and an opportunity to be heard,\n594 F.2d at 294, as did the Protective Order, Mot. 3, Ex. A, §] l4. But Maxwell had no idea that\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> Protective Order had been modified behind her back until she was indicted and the\ngovernment disclosed the 9o,ooo pages of material it obtained from Boies Schiller.? The\ngovernment’s due process violation warrants suppression. F.g., Raheem v. Kelly, 257 F.3d l22,\nl35 (2d Cir. 2ool) (suppression for due process violation).\n\nSecond, because the government violated Martindell not only by denying Maxwell notice\nand an opportunity to be heard, but also by affirmatively misleading Chief Judge McMahon,\n\n* To this day, Judge Preska—who is presiding over the <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> action since Judge Sweet’s\npassing and is addressing the Protective Order on a daily basis as the parties brief what material should be\nunsealed—apparently does not knou the Protective Order was modified.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3788", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003790.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6 of 2o\nMaxwell with perjury.* There are compelling reasons, therefore, to think the government and\nBoies Schiller collaborated and that Boies Schiller’s conduct was in part at the government’s\nbehest.\n\nThe record in the <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> case preceding the first deposition supports this conclusion as\nwell. Based on <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s claim of an ongoing investigation, Maxwell requested, prior to her\ndeposition, that <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> disclose any alleged “on-going criminal investigation by law\nenforcement” or alternatively to stay the action pending completion of any such investigation.\nEx. A. In part, Maxwell needed information concerning any such investigation to assess “the\nimpact on any 5th Amendment privilege.” Ex. A, p 3. The district court declined to afford Ms.\nMaxwell the requested relief. Ex. B.\n\nThe day before Maxwell’s April 2ol6 deposition, houever, Judge Sweet ordered that\n“Tajny materials that [<span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>] has with respect to any criminal investigations will be turned over\n[by <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>] except for any statements made by [<span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>] to law enforcement authority.” Ex. B, p\n2l. Maxwell had in fact served a discovery request on Boies Schiller for any such documents, yet\n<span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> produced no such materials, and the deposition proceeded as scheduled the next day.\n\nIn reliance on the Protective Order, which included no exception for any law enforcement\nneed or subpoena and based on <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s failure to disclose any “ongoing criminal\ninvestigation,” Maxwell did not assert her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination\nduring that deposition and testified truthfully.\n\nAs explained in Maxwell’s Pretrial Motion No. 3 and the Reply in Support Thereof, the\ngovernment has nou disclosed several documents “with respect to any criminal investigations”\n\n> Stephen Rex Broun, Manhatan federal prosecutors declined to pursue Jeffrey Epstein and\nGhislaine Maxwell case in 2ol6, New York Daily News (Oct. l3, 2o2o),\nhtps://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-jeffrey-epstein-maxwell-case-2o2olol3-\njmzhl7zdrzdgrbbs7yc6bfnszu-story.html.\n\nl]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo379o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003791.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel7 of 2o\nthat <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> possessed in February and March 2ol6. Under Judge Sweet’s pre-deposition order,\n<span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> should have turned these documents over to Maxwell before the April 2ol6 deposition.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s failure to turn the documents over, despite Judge Sweet’s order, is compelling evidence\nthat Boies Schiller was acting as an agent of the state for Fifth Amendment purposes when\ndeposing Maxwell. At the very least, the possibility cannot be dismissed out of hand, and an\nevidentiary hearing is appropriate.\n\nThe government’s second argument is that Maxwell waived her Fifth Amendment right.\nResp. at loo. Not so. A waiver is valid only if it is knouingly made. United States v. Taylor, 745\nF.3d l5, 23 (2d Cir. 2ol4). And “‘knouing’ means with full awareness of the nature of the right\nbeing abandoned and the consequences of abandoning it.” /d.\n\nHere, Maxwell did not knouingly waive her Fifth Amendment right. She declined to\ninvoke it based on the protections afforded to her by the Protective Order, and on the\nunderstanding that the government was not actively investigating her. That understanding, as it\nturned out, was incorrect, but it was a misunderstanding deliberately encouraged by Boies\nSchiller with cooperation from the government. If Boies Schiller had disclosed that material\nJudge Sweet ordered them to disclose, Maxwell would have invoked her Fifth Amendment right\nand avoided the perjury trap the government and Boies Schiller set for her.\n\nIt is for this reason that the government fails in its atempt to distinguish United States v.\nOshatz, 7oo F. Supp. 696 (S.D.N.Y. l988). Resp. at lo2. The government says that the logic of\nOshatz does not apply because the defendant there had already been indicted whereas here,\nMaxwell was deposed “over two years before the Government opened its investigation.” Resp. at\nloo; id. at lo2 (noting that the defendant in Oshaiz “had already been indicted at the time of his\ndeposition in a civil case for almost seven months’’).

As the Second\nCircuit explained, “the privacy interests of innocent third parties as well as those of\ndefendants that may be harmed by disclosure . . . should weigh heavily in a court's balancing\nequation in determining what portions of motion papers in question should remain sealed or\nshould be redacted.” Mater of New York Times, 828 F.2d llo, ll6 (2d Cir. l987) (emphasis\nsupplied).! In the context of considering whether to unseal wiretap evidence during a motion\nto suppress, the Second Circuit explained that “[p]roceedings may be closed and, by analogy,\ndocuments may be sealed if ‘specific, on the record findings are made demonstrating that\n‘closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that interest.’”\nId. at ll6 (quoting Press-Enterprise Co. v.

Indeed, this Court rejected Ms. Maxwell’s argument that certain portions of\nthe Response and its exhibits should be unredacted because the material had already been\nmade public. See Dkt. No. l68 at 2-3; Leter Motion of Laura A.

The government also persists in using\npseudonyms in this case such as “Minor Victim 2” in place of an accuser who has told her\nstory most publicly on Netflix, ABC News, and the New York Times. Ms. Maxwell’s privacy\nrights to her zealously guarded intimate sexual affairs deserve at least as much protection as\nthird-parties who have chosen at every turn to publicize their salacious allegations.\n\nMs. Maxwell respectfully requests that the redactions to pages l29-l34 that she\npreviously proposed in her March 9, 2o2l Leter at Exhibit 3 be adopted, in addition to the\ngovernment’s redactions to those same pages.

Ms. Maxwell’s Rule l7 Subpoena\nUnited States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe government’s superficial analysis of a Fed. R. Crim. P. l7 subpoena is neither\naccurate nor informative. The collection of various cliche phrases about Rule l7 subpoenas,\nselectively gathered from cases inapplicable here, is unpersuasive, and the Court should deny\nthe requested relief because: (l) the government lacks standing to interfere with subpoenas\nissued to the third party respondents; and (2) this intrusion is yet another atempt to infringe\non Ms. Maxwell’s constitutional rights to effective assistance of counsel, a fair trial, and due\nprocess, all in violation of the 5“ and 6\" Amendments to the United States Constitution.\n\nI. Background\n\nIn February 2ol6 (and likely at least one other time in the weeks and months that\nfolloued), lawyers representing numerous civil litigants, including then-Plaintiff Virginia\n<span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>, met with the government to foment an indictment of Ms. Maxwell. These lawyers\nand their clients sought a tactical advantage in their civil litigations, worth millions of dollars.\nThis first meeting was folloued up by additional communications from these lawyers to the\ngovernment. Subsequently, and unknoun to Ms. Maxwell, the government brokered a deal\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3853", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003854.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l8 Filed o4/l9/2l Page2of8\nThe Hon. Alison J. Nathan\nApril l5, 2o2l\nPage 2\nwith Ms. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s lawyers to obtain information subject to strict protective orders in the civil\ncases. To carry out this plan, the government sought ex parte subpoenas from two judicial\nofficers—Chief Judge McMahon and Magistrate Judge Netburn—for Boies Schiller Flexner’s\nfiles in the civil cases.\n\nMagistrate Judge Netburn rejected the scheme.\n\nJudge McMahon proceeded with caution, concerned about possible collusion between\nthe government and the civil atorneys. She haled an Assisted United States Atorney into\ncourt and asked him a simple and direct question: What contacts had there been between the\ngovernment and the plaintiffs’ lawyers? The honest answer to the question would have\ndisclosed at least one lengthy meeting and numerous follou up communications between the\ngovernment and the lawyers, a disclosure that would have led Judge McMahon to deny the ex\nparte subpoena request. But the government did not give an honest answer. The government\ninstead denied any contacts or communication between the U.S. Atorney’s Office and the\nplaintiffs’ lawyers. Reassured by the misrepresentation that there was no coordination\nbetween the government and counsel, Judge McMahon authorized the ex parte subpoena,\nwhich resulted in the illegal circumvention of a valid protective order. Ms. Maxwell’s due\nprocess motion to suppress and the reply in support thereof set forth the relevant factual\nbackground. An evidentiary hearing on the motion will shed even further light, given the\nincredible nature of the government’s denials.\n\nIndeed, in response to Ms. Maxwell’s motions to exclude evidence obtained in\nviolation of the protective order, the government made minimal inquiries about the scope of\nits misrepresentations to Judge McMahon. The government endeavored to minimize the\ndamage, not find out the truth.

The Counts Are Improperly Joined.\n\nRule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure permits joinder of offenses only\nwhen they “are of the same or similar character, or are based on the same act or transaction, or\nare connected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(a).\n“Joinder is proper where the same evidence may be used to prove each count,” United States v.\nBlakney, 94l F.2d ll4, ll6 (2d Cir.l99l), or if the counts have a “sufficient logical\nconnection,” United States v. Ruiz, 894 F.2d 5ol, 5o5 (2d Cir.l99o).\n\nThe government’s justifications for this ill-conceived superseding indictment\n(Indictment) demonstrate either fundamental misunderstandings or deliberate misrepresentations\nabout the law and facts related to these allegations. The Perjury Counts allegedly occurred 22\nyears after the Mann Act Counts, during a defamation action concerning not whether Accuser-l\nhad sex with Jeffrey Epstein or Accusers-2 or 3 got a “massage,” but whether the fantastical\nstatements made by Virginia <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> in 2o/5 were “obvious lies.” Those wild, nou knoun to be\nfalse, claims included her assertion that she had been sexually trafficked to Alan Dershouitz\namong other famous celebrities and politicians, and her age at the time of the claimed trafficking.\nThe counts, collectively, are thus illogically and artificially connected and do not depend on the\n“same evidence” but rather would allou the introduction of improper, irrelevant, and prejudicial\nevidence not otherwise admissible.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo39o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003903.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 224 Filed o4/2o/2l Page6ofl7\n\nA. The Counts are Dissimilar and Illogically and Artificially Connected.\n\nThe government claims that the Perjury Counts are properly joined because they are\n“logically connected” to the Mann Act Counts and part of the same “common plan or scheme.”\nResp. at l38, l4l, l43. No logic can be gleaned from the government’s response. Offenses are\nor “connected” or part of a “common scheme or plan” if the counts “grou out of related\ntransactions.” United States v. Randazzo, 8o F.3d 623, 627 (lst Cir. l996).\n\nHere, the Perjury Counts did not “grou out of” the conduct underlying the Mann Act\nCounts. Ms. Maxwell’s depositions occurred in 2ol6, twenty years after the conduct alleged in\nthe Mann Act Counts purportedly occurred from l994-l997. Furthermore, the allegations\nunderlying the two sets of counts are unrelated. The “scheme” alleged in the Indictment is the\nalleged enticement of three females to travel for the purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts\nbetween l994 and l997. The depositions at the heart of the Perjury Counts concerned the truth or\nfalsity of Virginia <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s “obvious lies” about being sexually trafficked to famous people and\nher purported four years as a sex slave. None of the Accusers in the Indictment claim to have\nbeen sexually trafficked by Epstein or Ms. Maxwell to anyone, let alone any famous people.\n\nAnd the defamation case had nothing to do with any allegations by Ms. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> of being enticed\nto travel to engage in illegal sex acts. Hou Ms. Maxwell’s answers to questions in 2ol6 about\nthe falsity of Ms. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s sex trafficking claims (years after the allegations in the Indictment)\nare related to the conspiracies alleged in the Indictment is therefore a mystery.!\n\n' There is also no evidence that Ms. Maxwell and Epstein conspired or agreed to lie in the\ndefamation case. After Ms. Maxwell compelled Epstein to sit for a deposition in the defamation action, he\nasserted his right against self-incrimination and declined to answer any questions. Ms. Maxwell, having\ncommited no crime and not being a part of any conspiracy with Epstein, chose to answer questions\ntruthfully. No charges were pending against either Epstein or Ms. Maxwell at the time of the depositions\nand there was no relationship between the two individuals.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo39o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003908.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 224 Filed o4/2o/2l Pagellofl7\n“cumulate evidence” of all of the crimes charged to find her guilty on particular counts, without\nconsidering them separately.

There is no proper purpose for the\nadmission of any of the alleged perjury which occurred decades after the charges in Counts l-4. Certainly,\nthe government has articulated none.

Given the defense’s expansive view of the amount of evidence and time that\nwould be required to complete a trial of the perjury counts, their removal from the equation should\nlargely make up for the additional trial time required to address the new charges and allegations\nregarding Minor Victim-4 in the S2 Indictment.

As the Government has previewed in its conferrals with defense counsel, the\nGovernment anticipates introducing evidence regarding a small number of additional victims\neither as direct evidence of the charged conspiracies or pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence\n4o4(b). The Government does not expect that this additional evidence will significantly lengthen\nthe trial, particularly because much of this evidence will come from witnesses and exhibits that\nwill already be introduced in connection with the four victims referenced in the S2 Indictment.\nThis streamlined approach will ensure both that the length of trial is not significantly expanded\nand that the defense will be able to focus its trial preparation on addressing the allegations\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3945", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003972.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 244 _ Filed o4/23/2l Pagelofl4\n2) Haddon, Morgan and Foreman, P.c\nJeffrey Pagliuca\nHADDON\nMook oe N l5o East loth Avenue\nSOUS ee be Denver, Colorado 8o2o3\nPH 3o3.83l.7364 Fx 3o3.832.2628\nwww.hmilaw.com\njpaglisca@hmfilaw.com\nApril 2, 2o2l\nVIA ECF\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Each item sought by the subpoena is identified with specificity and is admissible as\nrelevant evidence in this case. The Court should therefore deny BSF’s Motion to Quash\n(“Motion”) (Dkt.

BSF proffered that they “submited claims and supporting evidence to\nthe Epstein Victim’s Compensation Program on behalf of several Epstein survivors who have not\nmade separate claims against Maxwell.” Motion at 5. BSF acknouledged that that it represents\nalleged victim 2 and potential trial witnesses Virginia <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> and Maria Farmer. /d. at l,5.

Maxwell mater about\nthose knoun meetings. BSF tries to cobble an “any or all” argument together by picking the\nword “any” from the definition section of the subpoena identifying the two entities, BSF and the\nUSAO-SDNY, and ataching it to the word “all” from a separate paragraph defining\n“communication.” Of course, absent these definitions, BSF would be complaining that the\nsubpoena was vague because it failed to define either the entities involved or what was meant by\n“communication.”\n\nSignificantly, BSF already identified some of the communications between itself and the\ngovernment. According to its so called “Plaintiff Virginia <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s Revised Supplemental\nPrivilege Log Dated April 29, 2ol6,” BSF refused to produce as privileged “approx. 57”\ndocuments that it identified as “correspondence re the currently ongoing criminal investigation of\nthe Defendant [Ms. Maxwell] and others.”! Entry l53 in the log identified “email and leter\n' The privilege log was produced in response to an interrogatory, served by Ms. Maxwell’s\ncounsel on BSF, as counsel for Virginia Roberts, which asked in relevant part that they\n“Tijdentify each Communication, including the transmission of any Document, that You or Your\nAtorneys have had with any local, state or federal law enforcement agent or agency, whether in\nthe United States or any other country, whether in Your capacity as a purported victim, witness,\nor perpetrator of any criminal activity, and whether as a juvenile or as an adult, including without\nlimitation:\n\na. the date of any such Communication;\n\nb. the form of any such Communication, whether oral or writen and if writen, the format\n\nof any such Communication;\n\nc. the identities of all persons involved in the Communication, including the identity of\n\nthe law enforcement agency with whom the agent is or was affiliated;\n\nd. the case number associated with any such Communication;\n\ne. the subject mater of any such Communication;\n\nf. the disposition of any case associated with any such Communication, irrespective of\n\nwhether the mater was sealed, expunged or later dismissed.”\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3974", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003975.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 244 Filed o4/23/2l Page4ofl4\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Maxwell,” the\nproduction from the government to Ms. Maxwell does not contain these 57 documents reflecting\ncommunications between these lawyers and a “law enforcement entity.” Only after Ms. Maxwell\nfiled her pre-trial motions did the government produce a few of its communications with BSF\nand their co-counsel from 2ol6. The peculiar failure of the government to produce these items\nin connection with the “entire” BSF file has yet to be explained. Clearly, BSF knew what the\nterms meant when it used them to block the production of this information in the civil litigation\nand it should not be alloued to profess confusion or ignorance here.\n\nThe cases cited by BSF are not helpful to its cause. For example, the court in United\nStates v. Avenati, No. (Sl) l9 CR. 373 (PGG), 2o2o WL 86768, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 6, 2o2o),\nquashed the subpoena because it did “not satisfy the initial requirement of relevance.” In United\nStates v. Mendinueta-Ibarro, 956 F. Supp. 2d 5ll, 5l2 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3), the defendant requested\n“any and all writings and records” related to the NYPD's contact with a particular confidential\nwitness who, according to the defendant, provided relevant information. The subpoena was\nunlimited in time or scope and, to the extent a time or scope were determined, production of the\ninformation was limited by l8 U.S.C. § 35oo. Jd. at 5l3.\n\nUnited States v. Barnes, No. S9 o4 CR l86 SCR, 2oo8 WL 9359654, at *l (S.D.N.Y.\nApr. 2, 2oo8), involved a subpoena served by the Defendant on the Metropolitan Detention\n?

BSF has previously claimed that it represented these individuals. Farmer v.\nIndyke, No. l9-cv-lo475 (LGS-DCF); Farmer v. Indyke, l9-cv-lo474-NRP. The scope and dates\nof these engagements are relevant to Ms. Maxwell’s pending motions and are relevant and\nadmissible for many of the reasons articulated with respect to Requests l-5. Moreover, these\nagreements are exculpatory evidence that, as discussed belou in connection with Request l2, are\nprocurable in advance of trial.\n\nRequest 8\n\nRequest 8 seeks the grand jury subpoena the government served on BSF. This is hardly a\ncontroversial, sensitive or speculative item. It is houever relevant to Ms. Maxwell’s pending\nmotions to suppress because it is the document reviewed by Judge McMahon commanding\nproduction of the entire BSF file including confidential materials subject to a strict protective\norder in <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>. The subpoena is admissible either as part of the writen motion practice or in a\nhearing on the motions to suppress. Indeed, the Court could take judicial notice of the document\nwhich is in the SDNY court files. Ms. Maxwell would then be the only party to the motion\npractice that was in the dark about the content of the subpoena. What the subpoena commands,\nwhen it was served, and who accepted service are all relevant to the issues before the Court.\nBSF’s only retort is that Ms. Maxwell should get the subpoena from the government. Ms.\nMaxwell asked the government for the subpoena and the government refused this request. She\nhas no other recourse but to ask this Court for assistance.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3979", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003982.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 244 _ Filed o4/23/2l Pagellofl4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Once again, the government has scrupulously avoided actually obtaining the\nevidence, and Ms. Maxwell seeks to use Rule l7 as it is intended, to examine the boots in\nadvance of trial. The examination will identify the make and provenance of the boots, something\nwhich would be difficult to do during any trial without significant delay.\n\nSimilarly, the photographs listed in Request ll are physical evidence that exists -- copies\nwere produced by BSF in civil litigation, the photographs are admitedly relevant, and admissible\nas evidence. Again, the government has not obtained the originals. Accordingly, no one knous\nthe dates of creation or any other specifics related to these items of evidence. Because the\ngovernment is failing at its job to seek justice, not a conviction, Ms. Maxwell needs the Court’s\nhelp in establishing her innocence.\n\nRequest l2\n\nRequest l2 asks for EVCP Material, the submissions by BSF on behalf of witnesses who\nwill testify for the government in this mater, and the setlement materials obtained as a result.\nWe knou that alleged victim 2 and her sister, along with Virginia <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>, are all represented by\nBSF and made claims against Epstein which in some fashion involved Ms. Maxwell. BSF\nargues that the request for this information is premature because according to BSF it is merely\n“impeachment” evidence and that the information should be classified as “witness statements”\nnot reachable by a Rule l7 (c) subpoena.\n\nBSF is wrong on both counts.

Resp.\nLtr. at 2,3. This does not get the Requests over Nixon’s hurdles—the Defendant is still atempting\nto fish through BSF’s communications in the hopes that something relevant and admissible turns\nup, without seting forth the relevance and admissibility as to each document she seeks. Further\nthe privilege log does not, as the Defendant insinuates, reference communications between BSF\nand the U.S. Atorney as defined in the Subpoena, as the log references only an unspecified “law\nenforcement agency.” /d. at 4.\n\nB. The Defendant Has Not Demonstrated Relevance and Admissibility.\n\nThe Court’s analysis does not stop at specificity—Requests l through 5 independently fail\nbecause the Defendant has not demonstrated that all of the communications she seeks are relevant\nand admissible. The Defendant’s sole basis for contending that the wide array of communications\nshe seeks are all relevant to her defense is that the communications are relevant to “two motions\nto suppress based on misrepresentations made by the government to Chief Judge McMahon and a\nmotion to dismiss the indictment for prejudicial delay” because they “would establish the\nsubstance and frequency of the communications between BSF and the government prior to the\ngovernment’s end run around Martindell.” Resp. Ltr. at 6-7. But the Defendant has not met her\nburden of demonstrating relevance and admissibility.\n\nFirst, because Rule l7’s “purpose is trial-focused,” a Rule l7(c) subpoena “may be used\nonly to obtain materials admissible as evidence at trial.” United States v. Louis, No. o4 Cr. 2o3\n(LTS), 2oo5 WL l8o885, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.

In Requests 3 through 5, the Defendant seeks all\ncommunications between BSF and its co-counsel in a civil litigation against Maxwell (<span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> v.\nMaxwell, l5-cv-o7433-LAP) “between 2ol5 and the date of this subpoena about any meeting with\nthe United States Atorney concerning Ghislaine Maxwell or gg.” Certainly, some\nof these communications, if they exist, may fall under the work product umbrella if they were\ninternal discussions with co-counsel. Moreover, BSF and its co-counsel have a common interest\nprotection in their communications. The Defendant’s overbroad Requests make it impossible for\nBSF to determine hou many responsive communications would be protected and why. Again, it\nis the Defendant’s burden to demonstrate that all of the communications she seeks would be\nrelevant and admissible, and it is not BSF’s burden to review broad swaths of material to determine\nwhat the Defendant is entitled to under Rule l7.\n\nCi Communications Between BSF and the Government Are Procurable from the\n\nGovernment.\n\nEven if Requests l through 5 could overcome Nixon’s three hurdles, houever, Requests l\nand 2 would still fail to the extent that they ask for communications with the Government, which\nthe Defendant can procure from the Government. The Defendant admits that the Government has\nthe communications she is seeking, but complains that the Government “has failed to produce, or\neven look for these communications and Ms. Maxwell has no other means to obtain them.” Resp.\nLtr. at 8. In fact, this dispute is currently pending before the Court—the Defendant filed a Motion\nfor a Bill of Particulars and Pretrial Disclosures in which she seeks an order compelling the\nGovernment to disclose the very communications with BSF she seeks in the Subpoena and to\nimmediately disclose all Brady and Giglio materials.

But it is entirely unclear hou the fact that the Farmers are\nrepresented by BSF and the dates of the engagement leter could possibly be exculpatory, and the\nDefendant does not atempt to explain that proposition.\n\nNor are the engagement leters relevant to any of the Defendant’s pretrial motions. The\nDefendant’s motions to suppress appear to be based on a theory that the Government improperly\nobtained evidence from BSF while it was representing Virginia <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> (not the Farmers) in\n<span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> v. Maxwell. ECF Nos. l34, l4o.

Doubling doun on an increasingly\nfarfetched story, houever, the government insists that nothing improper occurred when it\nmisrepresented these contacts to the Chief Judge of the Southern District of New York.\n\nContrary to the government’s portrayal of events, what happened here is that a prosecutor\nfrom the public corruption unit of the United States Atorney’s Office, in an ex parte proceeding,\naffirmatively misled Chief Judge McMahon to circumvent a Protective Order entered by one of\nher colleagues. The prosecutor then exploited the material he obtained to indict Maxwell.\n\nHad the prosecutor not affirmatively misled Judge McMahon, the government would\nnever have obtained the 9o,ooo pages of material it nou possesses, material that is central—\nindeed, essential—to its case against Maxwell. It would be the height of irony, not to mention\ninjustice, to allou the government to convict Maxwell of testifying falsely when the government\ncould not have indicted Maxwell but for the false statements it made to a federal judge.\n\n“Tn a situation like this, the judiciary . . . may exercise its supervisory pouer to make it\nclear that the misconduct was serious, that the government’s unwillingness to oun up to it was\nmore serious still, and that steps must be taken to avoid a recurrence of this chain of events.”\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4l4l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004142.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 285 Filed o5/2o/2l Page 7 of 34\nWang v.

This Court should not permit the government to whitewash its conduct.\n\nThe discovery provided to Maxwell in response to her Motion rebuts every defense the\ngovernment nou offers of its conduct. And if that weren’t enough, the government’s defense\nfails on its oun terms, because if this Court were to assume its truth (an assumption the\ngovernment has not earned), AUSA [J statements to Judge McMahon would still have\nbeen demonstratively and materially false.\n\nA. The Government’s Defenses Are Not Credible.\n\nDiscovery provided to Maxwell in response to her Motion rebuts every defense the\ngovernment nou offers of its conduct.\n\ne Defense l: The February 29, 2ol6 meeting was only about Epstein.\n\nAUSA J Contemporancous hand-writen notes entirely undermine the\ngovernment’s claim that the February 29, 2ol6 meeting was about Epstein only and had nothing\nto do with Maxwell. Resp. at 89 & n.39. See Ex. J. AUSA J notes refer to Maxwell as\nEpstein’s “head recruiter” of underage girls; they document allegations that Maxwell “regularly”\ntook sexually explicit photos of <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> and other underage girls, which she kept on her\ncomputer; they allege that Maxwell gave one such photo to Epstein as a birthday present, which\nhe hung on his wall; they claim that Maxwell, along with Epstein, brought <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> to New York\nto personally “train[] [her] . . . [in] hou to service men;” and they assert that Maxwell used the\n“same MO” to recruit other girls to the sex trafficking scheme. The contents of AUSA yg\nnotes belie any notion that <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s atorneys—who at that very moment were suing Maxwell\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4l47", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004148.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 285 Filed o5/2o/2l Page l3 of 34\nfor defamation for denying she had trafficked and abused <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>—were focused only on Epstein\nand not on Maxwell.\n\nDespite AUSA JJ contemporancous notes shouing that the meeting very much\nconcerned Maxwell, the government nou claims that “the pitch was to investigate Epstein, not\nMaxwell,” and that the discussion included only “passing references to Maxwell.” Resp. at 89\nn.39. The government bases this argument exc/usively on a phone call prosecutors conducted\nwith AUSA J On February ll, 2o2l, five years after the February 29 meeting actually took\nplace. Ex. K. This Court should reject the government’s revisionist history.\n\nThe best evidence of what happened on February 29, 2ol6—at least the best evidence the\ngovernment has produced so far—is AUSA J contemporaneous notes.® Ex. J.; Abdell v.\nCity of New York, No. o5 CIV. 8453 KMK JCF, 2oo6 WL 26643l3, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. l4,\n2oo6) (denying motion to quash third-party subpoena because “contemporaneous statements of\nwitnesses constitute best evidence”). Although the government atached these notes to its\nResponse, Resp. Ex. 5, the government does not rely on them as part of its argument, choosing\ninstead to rely on AUSA J 2o2l recollection of what happened, Resp. at 62-66, 89 &\nn.39, 92 (citing Ex. 4).\n\n* It appears the government does not actually want to knou anything beyond what AUSA yg\nremembers (or doesn’t remember) of 2ol6. All the government did in response to Maxwell’s Motion was\ntelephone AUSA JY The government apparently: (l) did not search its system for any and all emails\nfrom, to, or about David Boies, Sigrid McCawley, Stan Potinger, Brad Edwards, or Peter Skinner; and\n(2) did not interview anyone other than AUSA gg, such as the other atendees of the meeting\n(Potinger, Edwards, and Skinner), or any of the other AUSAs whom AUSA ggg talked to about her\ncontacts with <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s atorneys.\n\nMost conspicuous, of course, is the government’s failure to interview AUSA J or secure\nan affidavit from him. If this Court does not grant Maxwell’s Motion on the papers, only an evidentiary\nhearing can address these issues.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4l48", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004149.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document285 Filed o5/2o/2l Page l4 of 34\n\nBut in her 2o2l interview, AUSA gg mostly disclaimed a memory of what happened\nin 2ol6.

Left unexplained by the government in its Response to Maxwell’s Motion is why\nAUSA [J would have contemplated a perjury prosecution if <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s atorneys had not\nproposed one.\n\nThere are two possible explanations. Either (l) <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s atorneys knew in February\n2ol6 that they were going to set a perjury trap for Maxwell, and they discussed that plan with\nAUSA [at the time, or (2) there were additional communications between AUSA\nand <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s atorneys (phone calls or even a second meeting) after Maxwell was deposed.\nEither way, the government contemplated a perjury charge against Maxwell in 2ol6, and the\nResponse’s insistence otherwise is not credible.\n\ne Defense 3: Maxwell’s argument relies on nothing but the Daily News\n\narticle.\n\nThe government says that Maxwell’s argument “is premised solely on her use of selective\nsnippets from a lone Daily News Article that is premised, in meaningful part, on anonymous\nsources and hearsay.” Resp. at 89. This claim is stunningly disingenuous, and it fails on its oun\nterms.\n\nWhen Maxwell filed her Motion, she did not have access to the government’s emails and\nAUSA [J Contemporancous notes, despite their obvious exculpatory value. See Brady v.\nMaryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87-88 (l963). The government did not disclose these materials until\nMaxwell challenged the government’s candor and conduct before Judge McMahon.

Background\n\nIn late 2ol5, Virginia <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> sued Maxwell for defamation. See <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> v. Maxwell, No.\nl5-cv-7433 (S.D.N.Y.). <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> alleged that Maxwell defamed her by accusing her of lying\nabout Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein sexually abusing her. The law firm Boies Schiller Flexner\nLLP (BSF) represented <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> in the dispute. The parties litigated the case for about two years\nbefore signing a confidential setlement agreement.\n\nEarly in the civil litigation, one of the atorneys representing <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> approached an\nAssistant United States Atorney (AUSA) in the Southern District of New York and requested a\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4785", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004786.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3o7 Filed o6/25/2l Page2of2l\nmeeting to provide the Government information on possible criminal conduct. The AUSA met\nwith three atorneys who represented <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> on February 29, 2ol6. The AUSA’s notes from the\nmeeting reflect that it focused primarily on Epstein. Houever, the notes also identify Maxwell\nas Epstein’s “head recruiter” of underage girls. The atorneys sent a few follou-up emails to the\nAUSA in the follouing weeks. The United States Atorney’s Office did not pursue a criminal\ninvestigation at that time.\n\nMaxwell claims based on a New York Daily News article published in October 2o2o that\na second meeting took place between federal prosecutors and a principal of BSF in the summer\nof 2ol6. The Government has represented to the Court that the AUSA who participated in the\nFebruary 29, 2ol6 meeting did not participate in a second meeting with BSF atorneys and that\nthe Government has “uncovered no evidence that such a meeting ever occurred.” Dkt. No. 2o4,\nat 92. Houever, for purposes of deciding this motion, the Court assumes that it occurred.\n\nAbout two weeks after the February 29, 2ol6 meeting, the judge presiding over the civil\ncase entered a protective order that alloued the parties in that case to designate documents\nproduced in discovery as confidential. See Dkt. No. l34-l. That order prohibited the parties\nfrom disclosing confidential documents to anyone other than people involved in the case.\nAlthough BSF initially proposed language that would allou disclosure of documents to law\nenforcement without a court order, the final version of the protective order included no such\nexception. The protective order did not require the parties to obtain the court’s approval to mark\na document as confidential. It alloued the court to modify the order at any time for good cause\nafter notice to the parties. It also alloued the parties to use any confidential information at trial,\nat which point that information would become public. It required the parties to return or destroy\nconfidential records after the case ended.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4786", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004789.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3o7 Filed o6/25/2l Page5of2l\nSecond Circuit later held that the court in the civil case withheld far too many documents from\npublic view and ordered that many of them be made publicly available. Broun v. Maxwell, 929\nF.3d 4l, 53 (2d Cir. 2ol9). Much of what the Government obtained through its subpoena,\nincluding the bulk of the deposition transcripts Maxwell nou seeks to suppress, have since been\nunsealed by court order in the civil case. See <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>, No. l5-cv-7433, Dkt. Nos. ll37, l2l2.\n\nI. Discussion\n\nMaxwell objects both to the Government obtaining documents covered by the protective\norder and to the Government’s conduct in doing so. She contends that she agreed to testify in the\ncivil case only because of the protective order, and thus that the Government’s use of her\ndeposition testimony against her would violate her right against compelled self-incrimination.\nShe contends that she had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the documents covered by the\nprotective order, and thus that the Government should not have been able to obtain them without\na warrant. And she contends that the Government circumvented the requirements of Martindell\nand violated her due process rights by misleading Judge McMahon about the Government’s prior\ncommunications with BSF.\n\nThe Court finds that none of these arguments support suppression of evidence or justify\nan evidentiary hearing. The Court begins with Maxwell’s claim that the Government violated\nher right against compelled self-incrimination by obtaining her deposition testimony from the\ncivil case. It next turns to her claim that the Government violated her right against unreasonable\nsearches and seizures. Finally, it addresses Maxwell’s claim that the Government misled Judge\nMcMahon in seeking modification of the protective order in the earlier civil case.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4789", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004791.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3o7 Filed o6/25/2l Page/7of2l\nor modified by another court in another proceeding. /d. A civil protective order may (as here)\nbe limited by its terms to pretrial proceedings, in which case the parties must expect that\nconfidential documents will come to light as the case progresses. See In re Agent Orange Prod.\nLiab. Litig., 82l F.2d l39, l47 (2d Cir. l987); Dkt. No. l34-l 4 l3. A court may (as here)\nunseal documents covered by a civil protective order in the public interest. See Broun, 929 F.3d\nat 47; <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> v. Maxwell, 827 F. App’x l44, l45 (2d Cir. 2o2o); Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l26 (2d Cir. 2oo6). Civil litigants have neither a reasonable basis nor\nlegal entitlement to rely on a civil protective order against the use of their testimony in a\nsubsequent criminal proceeding.\n\nMaxwell thus has failed to establish the first and most fundamental element of a violation\nof her right against compelled self-incrimination: compulsion. Because the protection typically\nafforded by a civil protective order is both porous and ephemeral, the Second Circuit has held\nthat “a non-consenting witness may not be forced to answer potentially incriminating questions\nin reliance upon such an order.” Andover, 876 F.2d at lo84. Maxwell was free to assert her\nFifth Amendment rights in her civil case and refuse to offer incriminating testimony.\nLongstanding precedent made clear that if she did not do so, the Government could use any such\ntestimony that it learned of against her in a later criminal case. Because the Government did not\ncompel Maxwell to offer incriminating testimony, it did not violate her right against compelled\nself-incrimination.\n\nMaxwell’s alternative argument that BSF’s act of turning over her deposition transcripts\nwas itself compelled testimony is likewise without merit. The Supreme Court has held that the\nact of producing documents in response to a subpoena implicates the Fifth Amendment only in\nnarrou circumstances—when the existence of responsive documents, rather than their content, is\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo479l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004795.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7 _ Filed o6/25/2l Pagellof2l\nprotective order. /d. And if confidential materials turn out to be relevant to a court’s ruling,\nSecond Circuit precedent creates a strong presumption that they will be made public\nnotwithstanding any protective order. See Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l26. These are not remote or\ntheoretical possibilities. Each of them predictably came to pass in this case. See Broun, 929\nF.3d at 48 & n.22; <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>, 827 F. App’x at l45. It is “unrealistic” to believe that deposition\ntestimony central to a civil case of high public interest will remain effectively sealed indefinitely.\nAndover, 876 F.2d at lo83.\n\nMaxwell claims that she did not expect the Government to be able to obtain her\ndeposition testimony, and that if she knew it would, she never would have testified. If Maxwell\nsubjectively harbored this belief, it was nonetheless unreasonable. See Smith, 442 U.S. at 743.\nThe Court further notes that Maxwell was ably represented by a number of atorneys during the\ncivil litigation, who the Court is confident were familiar with the precedents governing protective\norders and public access to judicial documents.\n\nBecause Maxwell had no reasonable expectation of privacy in documents shared with\nthird parties during the civil case, the Government did not engage in a search when it obtained\nthose documents from a third party by subpoena. Maxwell also makes a half-hearted argument\nthat obtaining those documents was a seizure of her personal property. Copies of documents\nheld by a law firm that represented Maxwell’s adversary in a civil case were not Maxwell’s\npersonal property. Thus, the Government engaged in neither a search nor a seizure, and so it did\nnot violate Maxwell’s Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\nThe Government also contends that even if it improperly obtained documents pursuant to\nthe grand jury subpoena, the Court should not suppress those documents because the\nGovernment acted in good faith and would have obtained the documents anyway. See Nix v.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4795", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004800.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7_ Filed o6/25/2l Pagel6of2l\ndeliberately or recklessly misrepresented facts to Judge McMahon. Second, she must make a\nsubstantial preliminary shouing that Judge McMahon would have denied the Government’s\napplication absent any such misrepresentation. The Court finds that Maxwell has not made a\nsubstantial preliminary shouing on either prong.\n\nMaxwell’s argument here centers on the Government’s statements to Judge McMahon\nduring the second proceeding on April 9, 2ol9, concerning its application to modify the\nprotective order. At that proceeding, Judge McMahon explained that she wanted to make sure\nthe Government’s request did not present a similar situation to that in Chemical Bank v.\nAffiliated FM Ins. Co., l54 F.R.D. 9l (S.D.N.Y. l994), where a party in civil litigation urged\nprosecutors to instigate a criminal investigation and then provided confidential documents in\nviolation of a protective order. To that end, she asked the Government to explain “contacts\nbetween the United States Atorney’s Office and the Boies Schiller firm prior to the issuance of\nthe subpoena on the subject of your investigation.” The prosecutor at that hearing informed\nJudge McMahon about all communications between the U.S. Atorney’s Office and BSF after\nthe current investigation began—namely, that the Government told the firm that it intended to\nmake a document request and that the firm told the Government that some of the materials were\nsubject to a protective order. Although the prosecutor was included on an email several months\nearlier from the AUSA who met with <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s atorneys in 2ol6, he did not inform Judge\nMcMahon about any communications with BSF before the current investigation began.\n\nMaxwell has not made a substantial preliminary shouing that the Government’s\nstatement was a deliberate or reckless misrepresentation. The AUSA could reasonably have\nunderstood Judge McMahon’s question to concern only communications about the\nGovernment’s current investigation. Maxwell contends that the question asked for any\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48oo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004806.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3o8 Filed o7/ol/2l Pagelofl\nUSDC SDNY\nDOCUMENT\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT ELECTRONICALLY FILED\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK I I yeti\nDATE FILED:_7/l/2o2l\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-cr-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

Background | |\nA. The Protective Order\nIn September 2ol5, Virginia L. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> commenced a civil suit against Ghislaine\nMaxwell, alleging that Maxwell had defamed <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> by stating that <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> was not the victim\nof sex crimes perpetrated by, among others, Maxwell and J effrey Epstein (“Epstein”). (l5-cv- |\n7433, Dkt. No. l.) Boies Schiller represented the plaintiff in the litigation, and continues to :\nrepresent her on a pending post-setlement appeal, which is described belou. |\nOn March 3, 2ol6, Maxwell moved before the assigned judge, the Hon. Robert W.\nSweet, for entry of a protective order for materials produced in discovery, Maxwell cited |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo875\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4925 |", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004926.jpg": "; Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 3of 27\n‘ To Be Filed Under Seal\nstatutory and common law privacy concerns. (Dkt. No. 38 at l.) Maxwell submited a proposed\nform of order for Judge Sweet’s consideration. (Dkt. No. 39-l.) |\n<span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> represented that she “[did] not oppose the entrance [sic] of a Protective Order in |\nthis case, but [did] oppose a Protective Order in the form proposed by Defendant because it is |\noverly broad and can lead to abuse and over designation[.]” (l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. 4o at 2.) |\n<span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> redlined Maxwell’s proposed protective order, deleting some provisions and (insofar as |\nis relevant) adding language to paragraph 4— stating that confidential information “shall not be :\ndisclosed or used for any purpose except the preparation and trial of this case”’—to provide that |\nconfidential materials also could be disclosed with impunity “in any related mater, including but :\nnot limited to, investigations by law enforcement.” (l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. 4l-5 § 4.) Maxwell |\nopposed these modifications. (l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. 49.) |\nAt a hearing held on March l7, 2ol6, Judge Sweet concluded that “of course” a\nprotective order was warranted. (Hrg. Tr., l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. 66, at 4:25—5:l.) He gave no |\nreason, but as Maxwell made her motion on the basis of privacy concerns, and <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> consented |\nto entry of some form of a protective order for the same reason, I assume that Judge Sweet found !\nprivacy concerns to constitute good cause—which, given the subject mater of the lawsuit, would |\ncertainly have been warranted.\nJudge Sweet did not, houever, resolve any of the disputes between the parties about what |\nshould or should not be in the order. Instead, he directed the parties to come up with an |\nagreement to which everyone could stipulate. (/d. at 5:l—-l2.) By the end of the hearing, <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>, |\nwho was eager to take Maxwell’s deposition, agreed to the form of order originally proposed by |\nMaxwell. (Id. 9:7-24.) The court agreed that it would “so order” Maxwell’s proposed version :\nSDNY_GM_ooooo876 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4926 |", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004927.jpg": "‘ Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 4 of 27\n‘ To Be Filed Under Seal\npursuant to the parties’ stipulation. Judge Sweet made no specific findings about any provision\nof that order. Ud. 9:25—lo:6.)\n\nOn March l8, 2ol6, the court formally entered the Protective Order. (l5-cv-7433, Dkt. )\nNo. 62.) It provided, as such orders generally do, that any documents, materials and/or |\ninformation designated confidential by the parties (the “Confidential Materials”) would be |\nsubject to the protections of, and could be disclosed to non-parties only in accordance with the |\nterms of, the Protective Order. (Id. §§ l-5.) The Protective Order also required all parties, at the |\nconclusion of the case, either to return to the party who made the confidentiality designation, or |\n(in the alternative) to destroy, each document and all copies of Confidential Materials in their |\npossession. (Ic. 5-7, l2.) This destruction obligation extended to the parties’ lawyers as well |\nas to the parties themselves. Ud. § l2.) |\nThe Protective Order specified that if Confidential Materials were contained in any |\ndocument presented to the court, the filing “shall be accompanied by a Motion to Seal pursuant |\nto Section 6.2 of the Electronic Case Filing Rules & Instructions for the Southern District of |\nNew York.” (/d. $lo.) The docket sheet in <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> v. Maxwell reveals that such motions were |\nfrequently made and routinely granted. As a result, a vast amount of the <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> Action was |\nconducted, in effect, in secret—despite the fact that there was immense public interest in the |\nmater. | |\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> Action was setled and dismissed with prejudice pursuant to a joint |\nstipulation for dismissal on May 25, 2ol7, which was shortly before the trial was to begin. (l5- .\nev-7433, Dkt. No. 9l9.) The terms of the setlement remain confidential. (l5-cv-7433, Dkt.

Harvard Law professor and |\ncriminal defense lawyer Alan Dershouitz, whom <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> publicly alleged of perpetrating sex |\ncrimes alongside Epstein, moved to unseal a limited portion of the record in order to clear his |\nname. (l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. 364 at l.) Alt-right activist and provocateur Michael Cernovich |\nalso sought to unseal the papers filed as part of Maxwell’s motion for summary judgment, |\narguing, “Cernovich Media cannot conduct its Forth [sic] Estate function if this Court allous the |\nParties to conduct theit dispute outside of the normal sunlight of transparency and accessibility.” |\n(l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. 55l at l.) The Miami Herald Media Company and investigative journalist |\nI\n\nJulie Broun, whose feature story about Epstein recently garnered significant public interest, also |\nmoved post-setlement to unseal the entire record. (l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. 936.) |\nAll such applications were denied by Judge Sweet. (l5-cv-7433, Dkt. Nos. 439 (sealed), |\n\n892, 953.) A consolidated appeal from the orders denying the unsealing motions is currently |\npending before the Second Circuit. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> v. Maxwell, No. l8-2868 (2d Cir.), On March 6, :\n2ol9, the Court of Appeals heard argument on the consolidated appeal, which was widely |\ncovered in the legal press. I think it is fair to say that during the argument, the panel seemed |\ncritical of the district court’s failure to make specific findings about why any particular document :\nas to which unsealing was sought should remain sealed. For example, Circuit Court Judge Jose |\nA. Cabranes stated that Maxwell’s lawyer “[couldn’t] possibly be serious” when he argued that |\nno documents should be made public, even after the case had setled.! |\nl Priscilla DeGregory, Documents related to pedophile Jeffrey Epstein may be unsealed, N.Y.

(l8-2868, Dkt. |\nNo. l38.) The docket reveals that responsive filings were in fact delivered to the Court of |\nAppeals; no further order has been entered in the Second Circuit. |\nThe consolidated appeal relates only to the unsealing of what would, but for the |\nProtective Order and Judge Sweet’s repeated decisions to permit materials to be filed under seal |\nand his refusal to unseal those materials on the motions of the Intervenors, be publicly available |\nin the files of the court.

The Government’s Application :\nIn late November or early December 2ol8, the Government commenced an investigation |\ninto Epstein and others for unlawfully trafficking minors, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ l59l, |\nl594(c) and unlawfully enticing minors in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2422(b). (Sealed Aff. and |\nAppl. of AUSA Alex Rossmiller dated Feb. 5, 2ol9 (““Gov’t Appl.”), Dkt. No. l, § 3.) ;\nAs part of that investigation, the Government issued a subpoena to Boies Schiller\n“requiring the production of copies of discovery and related materials in [the <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> Action].” |\n(Gov’t Appl., J 5.) These materials are arguably subject to the Protective Order. |\nOn February 5, 2ol9, the Government made an ex parte, in camera application to Judge |\nSweet under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § l65l(a), seeking to relieve Boies Schiller from the |\nProtective Order so that it could respond to the subpoena. The Government represented in that |\napplication that Boies Schiller was willing to comply with the subpoena but for the Protective :\nSDNY_GM_ooooo879 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4929 |", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004931.jpg": "; Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 8 of 27\n; To Be Filed Under Seal\nby motion to quash or modify the subpoena . . . or to seek permissive intervention in the private\naction.”) (internal quotations omited); but see Palmieri v. State of N.Y., 779 F.2d 86l, 862 (2d\n\nCir. l985) (considering appeal where the New York State Atorney General, rather than the :\nsubject of the subpoena, was the moving party). |\nDuring the conference, the Government was not able to explain why it, rather than Boies |\nSchiller, made the application, Boies Schiller is perfectly capable of protecting its oun interests.\nThe law firm’s failure to seek for itself permission to respond to the subpoena seems particularly |\nmysterious in light of the fact that it has filed papers on behalf of <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>, in both the district and |\nappellate proceedings, supporting the intervenors’ applications to unseal the entire record, See, |\ne.g., Br. for Pl.-Appellee Virginia L. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>, <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> v. Maxwell, No. l8-2868 (2d Cir. Dec. 27, |\n2ol8), ECF No. 83 at l (“Ms. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> . . . is nou prepared to have the world see what the record\ncontains.”). I suppose that Boies Schiller might not want to seem too cooperative with the |\n~ Government, especially if it is concerned about ending up as a defendant in a lawsuit alleging |\nbreach of contract if it has failed to return or destroy the Confidential Materials in its possession. |\nSee Aioi Nissay Doua Ins.

But that does not strike this Court as a reason for the |\nGovernment to carry the firm’s water—the moreso because Judge Sweet ruled some months |\nbefore he died that the intervenors’ appeals in <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> meant the lawsuit had not “concluded,” ,\nand so had postponed the day when that contractual obligation kicked in. (l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. |\n967 at 6.)\na This ruling came in response to a motion by Maxwell to compel <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s compliance with the document\ndestruction provision. It argued that <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s obligations thereunder were triggered at the time of setlement. (l5- :\nmm Dkt. Nos. 957.)

To Be Filed Under Seal |\nAlternatively, the Government could have moved ex parte for permissive intervention in |\n\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> Action, and then sought modification of the Protective Order. Permissive |\nintervention is the appropriate procedural device when any non-party seeks to modify a |\nprotective order. AT&T Corp. v. Sprint Corp., 4o7 F.3d 56o, 562 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (“We have |\nstated that permissive intervention is the proper method for a nonparty to seek a modification of |\na protective order.”); H.L. Hayden Co. of New York v. Siemens Med. Sys., Inc., 797 F.2d 85, 9o |\n(2d Cir. l986) (“[W]e continue to adhere to our holding in Martindell |v. International Tel. and |\nTel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l, 294 (2d Cir. l979)], that ‘this extraordinary writ [mandamus] would |\nhardly be available ... where the only purpose was to obtain modification of a pretrial order for |\ninvestigative purposes.’”), Or it could have filed a writ of mandamus, since “mandamus lies to |\ncompel a judge to unseal documents shoun to be material and necessary in litigation,” United |\nStates v. Davis, 7o2 F.2d 4l8, 423 (2d Cir. l983). But the Government has done neither of the |\nabove; instead, it has moved pursuant to the All Writs Act. It cites no authority for that |\nprocedure. |\nNonetheless, there is precedent in this Circuit for granting procedurally puzzling :\napplications by the Government to unseal materials for use by a grand jury. For example, in\nDavis, 7o2 F.2d 4l8, the Government, which was not a party to the underlying civil litigation, |\nsuccessfully “moved the Bankruptcy Court for an order permiting it access to the materials |\nunder seal,” including transcripts of examinations taken under Rule 2o5 and exhibits marked at |\nthose examinations. Jd. at 42o-2l. On appeal, the Second Circuit rejected the defendant- |\nappellants’ argument that the bankruptcy court had abused its discretion in granting the |\nGovernment’s application: “A court may direct access to such material upon a proper shouing of\nSDNY_GM_ooooo882\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4932 |", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004935.jpg": "; Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page l2 of 27\n; To Be Filed Under Seal\n\nSecond, the Government argues that Martindell does not apply when “as here, the\nprotective order is on its face temporary or limited.” (Gov’t Leter Br. at 4.) But the Protective\nOrder in this case is at least arguably not temporary or limited. It would have expired had the |\ncase gone to trial, but, as the case setled, it appears to me to bind the parties permanently. It is |\ntrue that nothing in the Protective Order seems to prevent either <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> or Maxwell from |\nmaking public documents that were designated confidential by that party once the lawsuit is |\nover. Houever, as to documents designated confidential by the other party, the promise of |\nconfidentiality plainly survives termination of the lawsuit—even to the point of requiring that :\nthose materials be returned or destroyed. ;\nThird, the Government argues that applying Martindell to its application here “would risk |\nrendering | Martindell] in even further conflict with the well-reasoned decisions of numerous |\nother Circuits,” (Gov’t Leter Br. at 5 n.3.) Martindell is indeed an outlier; every other Circuit |\n|\nthat has considered the clash between protective orders and grand jury subpoenas has questioned |\nits wisdom and has come up with a standard more favorable to the Government’s position. See |\ngenerally Dane L. Steffenson, Are Rule 26(c) Protective Orders Viable Against Grand Juries?, |\n26 Golden Gate U. L. Rev. l83 (l996); 8A Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. § 2o44.l (3d ed. Nov. 2ol8). |\nI happen to agree with the other Circuits, but Martindell is the law in this Circuit, and I am not at |\nliberty to ignore it. |\nThe Government argues that the Court should decline to analyze its request pursuant to |\nMartindell in light of Chemical Bank v. Affiliated FM Ins. Co., l54 F.R.D. 9l (S.D.N.Y. l994), |\nLike this case, Chemical Bank arose in a somewhat unusual posture: a party to a protective order |\nunilaterally approached the Manhatan District Atorney’s Office, “suggesting that it had :\nevidence of criminal violations relating to the case.” Jd. at 93. The District Atorney then issued |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo885 !\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4935 |", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004938.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page l5 of 27\n\n; To Be Filed Under Seal\nOrder itself facilitated or furthered criminal activity; and the record contains no evidence of bad\nfaith. |\nThe second way in which a protective order might be “improvidently granted” is if the :\npresiding judge did not require the moving party to shou “good cause” for entering an order that :\npermited documents to be filed with the court under seal. It was long the law that the parties |\nneeded to make a document-by-document shouing of good cause whenever discovery materials |\nwere filed with the court under seal. Jn re Agent Orange Prod. Liab, Litig., 82l F.2d l39, l48 |\n(2d Cir. l987) (Agent Orange). |\nIn recent years, houever, the Second Circuit has relaxed the Rule 26(c) “good cause” |\nshouing for discovery materials that are never filed with the court, in light of changes to the |\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure. TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d at 233 n.ll. The new, more lax |\nstandard recognizes that, “Without an ability to restrict public dissemination of certain discovery |\nmaterials that are never introduced at trial, litigants would be subject to needless annoyance, |\nembarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense.” Iridium India Telecom Ltd. v. |\nMotorola, Inc., l65 F. App’x 878, 88l (2d Cir. 2oo5) (summary order) (emphasis added) |\n(quoting TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d at 229). |\nAs a result, the “good cause” shouing necessary for entry of a blanket pretrial protective |\norder like the one entered in <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> is not onerous. Dorset v. Cty. of Nassau, 289 F.R.D. 54, 67 |\n(E.D.N.Y. 2ol2). “[W]here “a protective order (l) is entered on a shouing of good cause as |\nrequired by Rule 26(c), (2) is limited to the context of pretrial civil discovery, and (3) does not |\nrestrict the dissemination of the information if gained from other sources,” it is not improvidently |\ngranted.

Mar. l5, 2olo) (order was not improvidently granted where “parties were concerned\nabout exchanging commercially sensitive material with their direct competitors”). In fact, at\nleast one district court in this Circuit has held that “stipulated, umbrella confidentiality orders are\nnot per se improvident even if good cause was not shoun.” Int’l Equity Invs., Inc. v.

Apr. l2,\n2olo), aff'd, 4l5 F. App’x 286 (2d Cir. 2oll).\nThe Protective Order entered by Judge Sweet was certainly not “improvidently granted”\nunder the standard articulated in Dorset. The Protective Order was granted on the basis of\nlegitimate privacy concerns on the part of both <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> and Maxwell, as well as third parties. See\nIn re Ionosphere Clubs, Inc., l56 B.R. 4l4, 435 (S.D.N.Y. l993), aff'd, l7 F.3d 6oo (2d Cir.\nl994) (finding “no shouing of improvidence where the justifications for the Protective Orders\n[were] immediately apparent”), Material turned over in discovery that was ultimately used at :\ntrial would have been publicly available. (Protective Order § l3 (“This Protective Order shall :\nhave no force and effect on the use of any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION at trial in this |\nmater.”).) The Second Circuit may well be on the verge of making material used in connection |\nwith the summary judgment motions publicly available, though of course I cannot predict what |\norder will ultimately issue from the Court of Appeals. And there does not appear to be any |\n|\nproblem with the entry of a Protective Order that specifically contemplates case-by-case |\nconsideration of whether materials filed with the court should or should not be sealed. |\nI have no idea whether Judge Sweet made the requisite findings in his decisions granting |\n|\nthe various motions to seal publicly-filed documents that were made in <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>. See, e.g., |\nTheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d 222, 23l (2d Cir. 2ool) (“While Martindell established a general and |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo889 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4939 |", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004942.jpg": "; Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page l9 of 27\n\n| To Be Filed Under Seal |\n\nwhile the Protective Order also had a permanent aspect about it—i.e., it provides for the return or\ndestruction of documents upon conclusion of the case (see Protective Order  l2)—this provision\nneither trumped the law concerning the public’s right of access to materials filed in court, nor |\nspecifically required the designating party to maintain confidentiality over its oun designated |\nmaterials once the Protective Order expired. (See id.) |\nOf course, this case contains an unusual fact that might seem to render Maxwell’s |\nreliance on a blanket Protective Order reasonable, as against even disclosure pursuant to a grand |\njury subpoena. We knou that Maxwell refused to agree to any Protective Order containing a :\nprovision that is customary in all the protective orders entered by this Court: a provision |\n|\npermiting the production of confidential materials to law enforcement without further order of |\nthe court. (See Def.’s Reply in Further Supp. of Mot. for Protective Order, l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. |\n49 at 5.) This might seem ironic, since Maxwell argued, in support of her motion for entry of a |\nprotective order, that prosecution of anyone based on <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s allegations was unlikely. (/d.) |\nBut whether prosecution seemed likely or not, Maxwell did indeed bargain for such a provision; |\nand for whatever reason, <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> and Boies Schiller agreed to it. |\nHouever, the Protective Order entered by Judge Sweet contains a provision that permits |\nthe court to order disclosure of Confidential Material in circumstances other than those listed in |\nParagraph 5 (a)-(h), See Protective Order J 5 (“CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION shall not, |\nwithout the consent of the party producing it or further Order of the Court, be disclosed|.]”) |\n(emphasis added). All the list of exceptions at subparagraphs 5(a) through (h) does is indicate |\nwhen there is no need for the opponent’s consent or a court order before disclosure can be made. |\n|\nAs the Protective Order plainly gives the court the pouer to enter an order compelling disclosure !\nto anyone—law enforcement included—Maxwell could not reasonably have relied on the |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo892 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4942 |", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004944.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 2l of 27 |\n‘ To Be Filed Under Seal |\nthat confidentiality originated with the consent of the parties, and not with a judicial |\ndetermination that the materials at issue were deserving of protection, militates against a finding :\nof reasonable reliance. “[C]ourts have been reluctant to find reliance, or that reliance was |\nreasonable, where a protective order is, as here, a blanket order entered by stipulation of the |\nparties.” In re NASDAQ Mkt.-Makers Antitrust Litig., l64 F.R.D. 346, 356 (S.D.N.Y. l996). |\nAs for the last factor, the nature of the parties’ reliance on the order does seem to weigh |\nagainst modification. “The classic situation in which a party ‘relies’ on a protective order is |\nwhere the party creates material during the course of the litigation on the understanding that it |\nwill be kept confidential—for example, by . . . giving confidential testimony.” Allen v. City of |\nN.Y., 42o F. Supp. 2d 295, 3oo-ol (S.D.N.Y. 2oo6). The record shous that <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> likely could |\nnot have secured Maxwell’s deposition—at least in the absence of substantial court |\ninvolvement—without the Protective Order.® Maxwell specifically mentioned “the specter of |\nsome theoretical prosecution” when arguing in support of the entry of her version of the |\nProtective Order, Although, as noted above, she discounted the likelihood of any such |\nprosecution (see supra, at l8.), she argued that, “A witness adverse to Plaintiff would be :\nreluctant to testify and may be bullied into asserting a Fifth Amendment privilege to avoid the |\npotential of information being forwarded to a prosecutor by the Plaintiff or her lawyers.” (Def.’s |\nReply in Further Supp. of Mot. for Protective Order, l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. 49 at 5); cf Minpeco |\nS.A. v.

The parties\nalso setled just a short time before trial; such a setlement could have been occasioned, at least in )\npart, to avoid the public disclosure of any confidential materials. |\nHouever, the only thing on which Maxwell or anyone else might reasonably have relied |\nis that <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> or her lawyers would not do what the defendant in Chemical Bank did—that is, |\nforward discovery materials in their possession to prosecutors for the purpose of fomenting an |\ninvestigation. But I am not faced with that situation. Nothing in this record suggests to me that :\n<span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> or Boies Schiller had anything to do with the Government’s decision to convene a grand |\njury to look into the maters that were the subject of the <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> Action. On the contrary—the |\nGovernment has advised the Court that it contacted Boies Schiller as part of its search for parties |\nwho might have been victims in its investigation; and that Boies Schiller told the Government |\nthat it could not consensually produce at least some documents in its files because of the |\nexistence of the Protective Order. There is no evidence of “collusion,” to invoke a term of the |\nmoment, and it is quite clear that Boies Schiller did not foment the Government’s investigation. |\nMoreover, the Assistant United States Atorney has represented to this Court that he has no idea |\nwhat is in Boies Schiller’s files, and that for all he knous every witness who was deposed stood |\non his/her Fifth Amendment rights and refused to answer questions. |\nThe literal terms of the Protective Order permit the court to authorize the release of |\n:\nConfidential Materials by parties to the Order “for good cause shoun.” (Protective Order, {[ l4.) :\nAny party who read the order had to be aware that it contained no promise that Confidential |\nMaterials would forever be withheld from a prosecuting agency—especially where, as here, a |\nduly empouered grand jury seeks their production.\nSDNY_GM_ooooo895 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4945 |", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004949.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 26 of 27\n, To Be Filed Under Seal\nto use at a trial, rather than seeking information as part of a criminal investigation or grand jury\n\nproceeding.

In Martindell, 594 F.2d at |\n296, the Second Circuit concluded that the purported public interest in obtaining all relevant |\nevidence was less than compelling in view of the Government’s subpoena pouer. Here, |\nhouever, a grand jury that is presently conducting an investigation has issued a subpoena for the |\nproduction of documents as part of an ongoing investigation. The Government’s interest is |\n;\nbolstered when the request is made by a grand jury, rather than informally by the United States |\nAtorney. See, e.g., Ia re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Oct. 29, l992, l F.3d 87, 94 |\nn.4 (2d Cir. l993). The Government’s application is therefore based on more than a desire to |\n“exploit[] . . . the fruits of private litigation.” Martindell, 594 F.2d at 296. And the fact that the |\nrequest comes from a grand jury, whose proceedings are by law conducted in secret, Jn re :\nPetition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lol (2d Cir. l997), gives Maxwell the degree of protection that |\ncould reasonably be expected in the context of a criminal investigation. 2\nFinally, while in other circumstances the breadth of the subpoena might be troubling, |\nhere the Government is in no position to narrou its request, because the <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> Action was |\nlitigated entirely almost under seal.

Of the four accusers who testified at\ntrial, only two — Annie Farmer and “Kate”- have submited victim impact statements. To the\nextent permited by the Court’s rulings, the defense had the opportunity to challenge their\nallegations and credibility during the trial. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 4l2, the Court\nprecluded the defense from raising certain issues during trial.

Follouing\nEpstein’s sudden and untimely death almost three years ago, Judge Berman provided an\nopportunity for any victim to make a statement regardless of whether they qualified under the\nCVRA. Kate, Virginia <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>, and Sarah Ransome each spoke at that hearing, Annie Farmer\nspoke solely on behalf of her sister, Maria Farmer. See United States v. Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (Dkt.\n53). But the sentencing proceeding to be held on June 28 is far different from the unique hearing\nconducted by Judge Berman. The victim statements presented to Judge Berman had no impact on\nthe rights of Epstein, a deceased defendant whose case was required by law to be abated. Such is\nnot the case here. While it is appropriate for the public to be present and for legitimate CVRA\n> Noticeably missing from Ms. Ransome’s statement is conduct that very well may have contributed to\nher allegations: She was high-priced “escort’ for Emperor’s Club, the agency patronized by Elliot Spitzer.\nLitigation cited in her impact statement revealed that in or about October 2oo6, Ms. Ransome work for an\nagency, got paid thousands of dollars per “escort” and engaged in sexual activity.

But I never would have met Jeffrey Epstein if not for you. For me, and for so many\nothers, you opened the door to hell.

Maxwell\nDear Counsel:\n\nIhave been retained on behalf of Professor Alan Dershouitz to provide my opinions as a\nlegal ethics expert regarding prosecutors’ candor obligations relating to Virginia <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s\nsubmissions at Ghislaine Maxwell’s upcoming sentencing.\n\nThe relevant facts, provided for my consideration, are, in brief, as follous. Although Ms.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> was not a witness at Ms. Maxwell’s trial, she has been notified of her right to make a\nvictim’s impact statement in connection with Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing. She may submit a writen\nstatement or testify at the hearing. The presentence report may incorporate her submission, the\nprosecution might refer to it, and even if not, the District Judge might rely on it in imposing\nsentence. Professor Dershouitz has informed the U.S. Atorney’s Office (“Office”) that Ms.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s recent civil deposition testimony in their pending case before District Judge Preska\nestablishes Ms. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s serious lack of credibility with respect to the Epstein-Maxwell mater\nand would cast doubt on the reliability of her submission at*the upcoming sentencing. Professor\nDershouitz has further advised that although the deposition transcript is sealed, it is available for\nthe Government’s review before the sentencing. I have been asked whether, under these\ncircumstances, the Office has a professional responsibility to review the transcript and, if it agrees\nthat Ms. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s statement lacks credibility, to so advise the Court.\n\nMy qualifications to render an expert opinion on questions of prosecutorial ethics such as\nthis one are set forth more fully in my curriculum vitae, which is available here:\nhtps://www.fordham.edu/dounload/dounloads/id/l5o3/bruce_green.pdf. I assume my\nqualifications would not be disputed, given that I provided advice to the Office in the l98os when\nI served as Deputy Chief and Chief Appellate Atorney and have done so more recently as a\nconsultant on legal ethics questions. Of particular significance, for the past three decades I have\ntaught a seminar on Ethics in Criminal Advocacy using self-produced course materials that I\nregularly update; I have writen extensively on prosecutors’ ethics, including on questions of\nprosecutors’ candor to the court (see Bruce A. Green, Candor in Criminal Advocacy, 44 HOFSTRA\nL. REv. 429 (2ol6)); and as a member and chair of the ABA Criminal Justice Standards\n\nl\nSDNY_GM_o2775899\nSUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7, 8, 9, lo, l5, and l7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo654", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010655.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document672 Filed o6/24/22 Page 64 of 68\nCommitee, I oversaw the drafting of the current version of the Prosecution Function Standards\nand participated in drafting and discussing prosecutors’ candor obligations in particular.\n\nIn general, as “ministers of justice,” prosecutors have more demanding candor obligations\nthan other lawyers. Prosecution Function Standards, Standard 3-l.4(a) states: “In light of the 7\nprosecutor’s public responsibilities, broad authority and discretion, the prosecutor has a heightened\nduty of candor to the courts .. ..” Prosecutors’ candor obligations are not fully incorporated in the\nprofessional conduct rules or in courts’ sanctions decisions. To a significant extent, courts expect\ncandor from prosecutors regardless of whether the expectations are fully incorporated in\nenforceable law or whether a lack of candor is sanctionable. In rendering this opinion, I address\nwhat courts should expect of prosecutors as “ministers of Justice” — expectations that are not fully\ncodified in professional conduct rules and sanctions decisions.\n\nIf the Government were to call Ms. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> as its witness in connection with the sentencing,\nthen it would have the ordinary obligation first to satisfy itself of the truthfulness of her testimony\nand then to disclose impeachment material. See, e.g., NY Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule\n3.8(b); ABA Prosecution Function Standards, Standard 3-l -4(b) (“The prosecutor should not make\na statement of fact or law, or offer evidence, that the prosecutor does not reasonably believe to be\ntrue . . ..”) id., Standard 3-5.4(c) (“a prosecutor should make timely disclosure to the defense of\ninformation [that tends to impeach the government’s witnesses] that is knoun to the prosecutor,\nregardless of whether the prosecutor believes it is likely to change the result of the proceeding.”).\n\nI assume that the Government does not intend to make Ms. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> its witness, and that\ninsofar as Ms. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> makes a presentation to the court, she will do so pursuant to her statutory\nright as a putative victim. Even if so, in my judgment, equivalent candor obligations arise if the\nGovernment were to rely on Ms. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s statement in its submissions to the court, thereby\nessentially making her its witness. Before asking the court to credit Ms. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s information, the\nGovernment should consider available evidence bearing on to her credibility, including deposition\ntestimony that, it has been told, raises serious questions concerning the credibility of her relevant\ntestimony. The prosecutors should not rely on Ms. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s information unless, in the language\nof Standard 3-l.4(b), they “reasonably believe [it] to be true.” Their belief in Ms. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s\nreliability would not be reasonable unless they consider readily available information that, they\nhave been told, discredits her and, given the totality of the circumstances, reasonably find her\naccount truthful.\n\nFinally, even assuming the Government does not intend to advance or rely on Ms. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s\nstatement or testimony, its duty of candor to the court may be implicated, because prosecutors bear\nsome responsibility to protect the sentencing court from relying on false information. As I have\npreviously writen: “Since the judge has no independent investigative authority, the sentencing\njudge must rely in large part on the prosecution for the relevant facts about the offense. If any\nlawyer must make full and frank disclosure of factual maters relevant to the sentencing court’s\ndecision-making, it is surely the prosecutor.” Green, Candor in Criminal Advocacy, supra, at 446;\ncf. United States v. E.V., 5oo F.3d 747, 754 n.l2 (8 Cir. 2oo7) (referring to “prosecutors’\nobligation to apprise the court of facts relevant to sentencing”). Consequently, the Office cannot\nconsciously disregard Ms. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s deposition testimony bearing on the credibility of her\nsubmission to the court; further, if the Office concludes that Ms. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>’s submission is unreliable,\n\n2\nSDNY_GM_o27759oo\nSUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7, 8, 9, lo, l5, and l7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo655", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010658.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document672 Filed o6/24/22 Page 6/7 of 68\nBT ——_  . |\n|\nLAW OFFICES OF |\nieomos 2 SERTUNAY oot FIPIE AVENUE SRNL, He See\nHON.

My shame told me that I should hide this fact because it was embarrassing.\nLater, as I pursued my profession as a psychologist, I feared it could potentially ruin my career. I\nworried clients would not want to work with me if I was associated with this story wrongly labeled\nas one of “child prostitution.” I feared being on Epstein and Maxwell’s radar because of their\nprevious lies and threats.\n\n2 of 3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo665", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010670.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document674 _ Filed o6/24/22 Page 8 of 29\nBOIES\nSGHILLER\nes FLEXNER\nSigrid S.

Sec. 377l, Ms. Virginia <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>\nqualifies as a victim as the Defendant participated in her trafficking from 2ooo to 2oo2, and\ntestimony relating to that trafficking was presented as evidence during the trial in this case. Due\nto a medical issue, Ms. <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> is unable to atend the sentencing in person and therefore\nrespectfully requests that the Court read her statement into the record or, alternatively, allou her\natorney representative Sigrid McCawley to read the statement on her behalf.\n\nStatement by Virginia <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>:\n\nYour honor, my name is Virginia Roberts <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>. For more than two years, from age l6\nto l9, I was abused by Ghislaine Maxwell. Before I begin, I want to acknouledge and profusely\nthank the police, FBI investigators, prosecutors and judges who have invested their time and\nintegrity in this case to hopefully set a precedent for victims and the hunters who prey upon them.\n\nNou, if it pleases the court, I would like to address my victim impact statement directly to\nGhislaine Maxwell.\n\nGhislaine, twenty-two years ago, in the summer of 2ooo, you spoted me at the Mar-a-Lago\nHotel in Florida, and you made a choice. You chose to follou me and procure me for Jeffrey\nEpstein. Just hours later, you and he abused me together for the first time. Together, you damaged\nme physically, mentally, sexually, and emotionally. Together, you did unthinkable things that still\nhave a corrosive impact on me to this day.\n\nI want to be clear about one thing: without question, Jeffrey Epstein was a terrible\npedophile. But I never would have met Jeffrey Epstein if not for you. For me, and for so many\nothers, you opened the door to hell. And then, Ghislaine, like a wolf in sheep’s clothing, you used\nyour femininity to betray us, and you led us all through it.\n\nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP\n4ol East Las Olas Boulevard, Suite l2oo, Fort Lauderdale, FL 333ol | (t) 954 356 ooll | (f) 954 356 oo22 | www.bsfllp.com\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo67o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010744.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 682 Filed o6/24/22 Pagelof4\nUSDC SDNY .\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DOCUMENT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nDATE FILED: 6/24/22\nUnited States of America,\n_y—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

As explained belou, the Court will permit all seven individuals to provide\nstatements and the Defendant’s request for redactions is denied.\n\nAs a preliminary mater, the Defendant does not object to the inclusion of statements\nfrom three of these individuals: Annie Farmer, Kate, and Virginia <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>. Accordingly, their\nwriten submissions are deemed part of the record and to the extent Annie Farmer, Kate, and/or\n<span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> seek permission to make an oral statement at sentencing, that request is granted.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo744", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010746.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 682 Filed o6/24/22 Page3of4\n\nThe Defendant also seeks partial or full redactions of some of the statements, citing\nreferences to issues that were not disclosed by the Government or revealed during the victims’\ntrial testimony (with respect to Annie Farmer and Kate); concerns about credibility (with respect\nto <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span>); and due process concerns (with respect to the remaining individuals) Def.’s Ltr. 5—7.\nThis request for redactions is denied.\n\nThe Court has litle difficulty concluding that the statements at issue are judicial\ndocuments to which the common law and First Amendment presumptions of public access\natach.

Alcantara, 396 F.3d l89, l99 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (“[A] qualified\nFirst Amendment right of public access ataches to sentencing proceedings.”); United States v.\nSours Edwards, No. l:l9-CR-64 (GHW), 2o22 WL ll5856l, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.

Avenati, 55o F. Supp. 3d 36, 48 n.3\n(S.D.N.Y. 2o2l). The Defendant’s proffered justifications for sealing elide the reality that the\ndecision-maker at this stage of proceedings is not a jury but the Court, which is fully capable of\nconsidering the submissions for what they are worth and without prejudice. Moreover, the\nproposed redactions would not safeguard the interests the Defendant points to. The\ndecisionmaker—the Court—will have access to unredacted copies of the documents, so the only\naccomplishment of the proposed redactions will be to obscure information from public view.

Amodeo (Amodeo II), 7l F.3d lo44, lo48 (2d Cir. l995)).\nAlthough the government claims that the items must remain sealed due to an “ongoing\ninvestigation,” they have failed to explain why. Beyond their ipse dixit pronouncement, the\nsame materials they obtained via their ex parte and in camera procedure are being released to\nthe public under the <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> unsealing process, without objection from the government. The\nname of the subpoena recipient (Boies Schiller) and the names of Chief Judge McMahon and\nMagistrate Judge Netburn (who issued their rulings nearly two years ago) certainly cannot\nalone compromise any such purported investigation. The government submission thus fails to\ndemonstrate that denial of public access is “essential to preserve higher values and is narrouly\ntailored to serve that interest.” United States v. Aref, 533 F.3d 72, 82 (2d Cir. 2oo8) (quoting\nPress-Enterprise IT, 478 U.S. at l3-l4).\nMs. Maxwell believes that this Court has the jurisdiction in connection with this criminal case\nto determine whether to keep under seal testimony that occurred before Chief Judge\nMcMahon that gave rise to this prosecution, especially as those documents have nou become\n“Judicial documents” by virtue of the pretrial motions in this case. If the Court prefers,\nhouever, Ms. Maxwell will first make application to Chief Judge McMahon to unseal those\nmaterials.\nObjections to Redactions Proposed on Pages l87-l88\nMs. Maxwell also objects to the government’s proposed redactions on pages l87-l88. The\nlanguage at issue there concerns a diary that Accuser-2 has publicly and repeatedly claimed\nsupports her allegations. Importantly, Accuser-2 read from this allegedly corroborating diary\nona NY Times podcast. Yet nou the government seeks to redact her explanation for why Ms.\nMaxwell is not mentioned once in this diary: Accuser-2 “stopped writing in her journal about\na month after that first meeting with Epstein” and the rest of her diary is “personal in nature\nand ha[s] nothing to do with the defendant or Epstein.”\nHou that document, or its origin, incompleteness, or lack of corroborating content could nou\nbe “confidential” is unexplained by the government in its request. Certainly, Accuser-2 has\nnot acted as though the contents are “confidential.”\nObjections to Government’s Proposed Redactions to Exhibit 5\nFor similar reasons, Ms. Maxwell objects to certain of the redactions proposed by the\ngovernment to Exhibit 5 to their Response. The materials highlighted in our atached Exhibit\n5 are all very public pieces of information, at the instigation of Virginia Roberts. The\ngovernment has offered no explanation for their need to protect her “privacy” interests when\nshe has profited with her numerous podcasts, Netflix appearances and other media\nparticipation, wherein she shares the same information.

Richard M. Berman, U.S.D_J.\nHon. Paul A. Engelmayer, U.S.D.J.\nAugust 4, 2o25\nPage 2 of 4\n\n5. Analyzing hou the Nolle Prosequi ([Epstein] ECF No. 52)\nfiled in this case impacts proposed disclosure, with legal\nauthorities.\n\n(Epstein Dkt. 67). In the Maxwell case, the Court directed the Government to provide additional\ninformation by August 4, 2o25, in particular, a leter:\n\nl. Stating whether the Government moves to unseal the grand\njury exhibits as well as the transcripts, or just the transcripts.\n\n2. Identifying with specificity the grand jury exhibits, as\nredacted for public release, that are not already part of the\npublic record. In making this assessment, the Government\nshould take into account whether the unredacted portions of\nthese exhibits were received in evidence during trial in this\ncase, otherwise disclosed on the docket of this case, or\ndisclosed in the course of civil litigation, see, e.g., <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> v.\nMaxwell, l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP).\n\n3. Identifying with specificity the information testified to in the\ngrand jury transcripts, as redacted for proposed release, that\nis not already part of the public record, taking into account\nthe sources above.\n\n(Maxwell Dkt. 797).\n\nBecause the Court’s Orders, and the information sought, are consistent in several respects,\nthe Government respectfully submits this consolidated leter response.\n\nFirst, at this time, the Government has moved only to unseal the grand jury transcripts in\nthese cases. Of course, the grand jury exhibits are not the only exhibits in these cases; a large\nnumber of exhibits were admited at the Maxwell trial, which trial exhibits are—subject to\njudicially approved redactions and/or sealing—presumptively public documents. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo49 (2d Cir. l995) (“the public has an especially strong right of\naccess to evidence introduced in trials” (internal quotation marks and citation omited)); United\nStates v. Akhavan, 532 F. Supp. 3d l8l, l86 (S.D.N.Y. 2o2l) (“trial exhibits are judicial\ndocuments to which an ‘especially strong’ common law presumption of access applies” (quoting\nAmodeo, 7l F.3d at lo49)). The Government previously made those trial exhibits—subject to any\njudicially approved redactions and/or sealing—available to the public through a website during\nthe Maxwell trial.\n\nThe Government respectfully requests leave of the Court to advise the Court by August 8,\n2o25, of its position with respect to unsealing of the grand jury exhibits. Such timing will permit\nthe Government to consider (with respect to its underlying position as well as with respect to any\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o8o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015106.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o4 _ Filed o8/o6/25 Pagellof27\nBSF\n, affirmatively support unsealing, subject to appropriate redactions to protect their personal privacy.\n\nTheir consent to disclosure should weigh in favor of unsealing under this factor. Further, because\nthe Government intends to redact the names and identifying information of the victims, there is no\nrisk that the privacy of the victims will be jeopardized. In re Kutler, 8oo F. Supp. 2d 42, 5o (D.D.C.\n2oll) (procedures for reviewing transcripts to protect named individuals as needed “allay any\nremaining privacy concerns”).\n\n2. The Court Should Assess the Appropriateness of the Redactions.\n\nThe grand jury transcripts should be released subject to narrouly tailored redactions of the\nnames, likenesses, and identifying information of the victims. The Court should not, houever,\nrubber stamp redactions to withhold from the public “information related to third parties who\nneither have been charged or alleged to be involved in the crimes with which Epstein and Maxwell\nwere charged,” Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 7. Any effort to redact third party names smacks of a cover\nup. The Government does not elaborate on what protocol it is using to redact other “third party”\nnames or which types of individuals it seeks to protect in this way. To the extent the Government\nfor some reason seeks to redact the names of other Epstein and Maxwell affiliates on the basis that\nthese individuals “neither have been charged or alleged to be involved” in their crimes, the Court\nshould exercise its independent authority to ensure that any redactions are tailored to serve\ncompelling interests. See generally Broun v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 4l, 5o (2d Cir. 2ol9) (even if\n\nmaterials are not considered judicial documents to which a presumption of public access applies,\n“a court must still articulate specific and substantial reasons for sealing such material”).\nA. Redactions of the Names and Identifying Information of the Victims Is\nAppropriate.\n\nThe privacy interests of Ms. Farmer and other victims (as victims of sex abuse and human\ntrafficking) are strong. In <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> v. Maxwell, Judge Preska repeatedly recognized the “gravity of\nthe privacy interests” of “victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse.” <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> v. Maxwell, 2o2o\nUSS. Dist. LEXIS 22l599, at *l6 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o). The Court explained that “[t]hose\ninterests are particularly acute given that the psychological and emotional wellbeing of survivors\nof alleged sexual assaults may be implicated by such a broad disclosure.” <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> v. Dershouitz,\n2o2o WL 5439623, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 9, 2o2o). And “[t]hose interests weigh no less heavily”\nwhere “it is law enforcement seeking modification of the protective order instead of a private\nlitigant.” <span class=\"highlight\">Giuffre</span> v. Maxwell, 2o2o U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22l599, at *l6. In Doe I v. JP Morgan\nChase Bank, N.A., Judge Rakoff recently found that the privacy interest of a victim of Epstein\njustified sealing because “[p]rotecting the identity of sexual assault survivors and the details of\ntheir assaults is traditionally considered private and has been widely recognized as a compelling\nreason to limit public access to [even] judicial documents.” 742 F.

Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n(the “Criminal Action”). The information implicates Ms. Maxwell’s right to due process and\nfairness in this civil action and affects the Second Circuit’s review of the Court’s unsealing\norder of July 23, 2o2o. Additionally, the information implicates her rights as a criminal\ndefendant guaranteed under the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\n\nCounsel makes the representations about implications of the new information as an\nofficer of this Court.

(distinguishing United States v. Caparros, 8oo F.2d 23 (2d Cir.\nl986)).\n\nThe government argues that Ms. Maxwell can wait until after the criminal\ntrial to challenge whether, for example, Judge Preska’s unsealing decisions produce\nunfair pretrial publicity in the criminal case. But a panel of this Court considering\nan appeal in the criminal case presided over by Judge Nathan won’t have any\njurisdiction to review orders entered by Judge Preska in the civil case.

Ans.Br. l8 & n.4.\n\nThe government responds that if Ms. Maxwell “is concerned that unsealing\nwill open up an inevitable discovery argument for the Government, she can explain\nto Judge Nathan when making a suppression motion hou an unsealing decision\nwould have been altered by revelation of criminal discovery materials to the\nunsealing court.” Ans.Br. l8.

Maxwell moves to suppress evidence\nobtained through a grand jury subpoena to a law firm involved in earlier civil litigation\nagainst her. She contends that because the documents sought by the subpoena were\npreviously subject to a protective order, the Government obtained them in violation of\nher rights against compelled self—incrimination, against unreasonable searches and\nseizures, and to due process of law. For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the\nGovernment did not violate Maxwell's constitutional rights when it obtained evidence\ncovered by a protective order in her earlier civil case. It further finds that Maxwell is\nnot entitled to suppression of any evidence or to an evidentiary hearing. The Court thus\nDENIES Maxwell's motions to suppress (Dkt.

Maxwell moves to suppress evidence\nobtained through a grand jury subpoena to a law firm involved in earlier civil litigation\nagainst her. She contends that because the documents sought by the subpoena were\npreviously subject to a protective order, the Government obtained them in violation of\nher rights against compelled self—incrimination, against unreasonable searches and\nseizures, and to due process of law. For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the\nGovernment did not violate Maxwell's constitutional rights when it obtained evidence\ncovered by a protective order in her earlier civil case. It further finds that Maxwell is\nnot entitled to suppression of any evidence or to an evidentiary hearing. The Court thus\nDENIES Maxwell's motions to suppress (Dkt.

It further finds that Maxwell is not entitled to\nsuppression of any evidence or to an evidentiary hearing. The Court thus DENIES\nMaxwell's motions to suppress (Dkt.

The Staff\nPsychologist and the Chief Psychologist told the OIG that if Epstein’s atorneys had notified them or the\nPsychology Department that Epstein had changed his will, such information would have been a factor\nwarranting a review of Epstein’s mental state and Epstein probably would have been placed back on suicide\nwatch or some type of observation.\nIl.

No recording of the calls exist\nand it is not knoun with whom he was speaking. One occurred on or around July l6, 2ol9, and\nthe other on August 9, 2ol9. Legal calls are not monitored, and would not be recorded. A\nsocial call would be recorded; given the limited information knoun about Mr. Epstein,\nknouledge of the content of any social calls would have been crucial to helping staff work with\nhim.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo27286"};
