STERNHEIAA\nTo be clear, any such request will not be made from any desire of Ms. Maxwell to delay\nher trial but rests squarely on the government’s late, tactical, expansion of this prosecution.\nAt the initial appearance on July l4, 2o2o, the defense agreed to the July l2\" trial date\nbased on the government’s representation that is would not file a superseding indictment:\nThe trial schedule that we are agreeing to, of course subject to the court's\napproval, assumes there will be no substantive superseding indictment. If there is\none, which the government has advised us they don't believe is imminent or I\nassume not at all, we might have to come back to the court to address not just trial\nschedule but other schedule as well.\n\nJuly l4, 2o2o Transcript at l6 -l7 (emphasis added).\n\nIn response, the Court made the follouing inquiry:\n\nLet me go ahead and ask, Ms. Moe, Mr. Cohen has made a representation but I\nwill ask if you do anticipate at this time filing any further superseding indictments\nadding either defendants or additional charges?\n\nId. at l7.\n\nThe government confirmed:\n\nMS. MOE: Your Honor, our investigation remains ongoing, but at this point we\ndo not currently anticipate seeking a superseding indictment.\nId.\n\nBased on that representation, Ms. Maxwell accepted a July l2, 2o2l trial date and her\nlawyers planned accordingly, postponing trials in other cases to preserve this high-priority date.\nIt was only after considerable judicial and defense resources were expended that the government\nbelatedly superseded, again, with no justifiable reason given the age of these allegations. The\ntiming suggests that the decision to supersede was prompted by the filing of defense pretrial\nmotions and government concern about the nou-apparent weakness of its case. The government\nmay be entitled to supersede but not when its decision disrupts the schedule set by the Court and\nrelied on by Ms. Maxwell. This delay has a prejudicial effect on counsel’s readiness for trial and\nMs. Maxwell’s prolonged detention.\n\nThis is no longer the “two-week” trial as represented by the government. By adding\ncharges that encompass dozens of additional witnesses, the government has unilaterally\ndestroyed the possibility that this case can be completed in the time alloted.

This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\n\nOs Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\nIdentified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\ninfluenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement\nauthorities.\n\nIn a declaration submited to the district court in 2ol7 in connection with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ...

A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall, many of the\n\nvictims were troubled about the existence of the investigation. They displayed\n\nfeelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to\n\ninvestigators. Some victims who were identified through the investigation refused\n\neven to speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and geting to\n\nthe truth were always at the forefront of our handling of the investigation.\n\nIn addition, during the CVRA litigation, an atorney representing several victims filed a pleading to protect\nthe anonymity of his clients by preventing disclosure of their identities to the CVRA petitioners. See Response to\nCourt Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance (July 24, 2ol5).

The contemporaneous\ncommunications confirm that in 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman were aware of the Department’s policy\nregarding the issue.\n\nUnrelated to the Epstein investigation, on April l8, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman received a\ncitizen complaint from an atorney who requested to meet with them regarding his belief that the\nFlorida Bar had violated his First Amendment rights. The atorney asserted that the CVRA\n<span class=\"highlight\">guaranteed</span> him “an absolute right to meet” with USAO officials because he believed that he was\nthe victim of a federal crime.

Martindell, 594 F.2d at\n294 (Martindell decided in l979). The proper procedure for modifying a civil Protective Order at\nthe government’s request, in other words, is the one that affords due process. U.S. CONST.\namend. V.\n\nThat no case has addressed the remedy for a Martindell violation is evidence only of (l)\nthe government’s prior compliance with Martindell (which should, of course, be expected), or\n(2) a criminal defendant having not raised the issue before. In this case, houever, (l) the\ngovernment violated Martindell, and (2) Maxwell seeks suppression as a sanction.\n\nSuppression is the proper remedy for at least two reasons. First, at its heart, Martindell is\ngrounded in due process principles, and the government’s conduct here violated Maxwell’s right\nto due process. See U.S. CONST. amend. V. The essence of due process is notice and an\nopportunity to be heard. Martindell <span class=\"highlight\">guaranteed</span> Maxwell notice and an opportunity to be heard,\n594 F.2d at 294, as did the Protective Order, Mot. 3, Ex. A, §] l4. But Maxwell had no idea that\nthe Giuffre Protective Order had been modified behind her back until she was indicted and the\ngovernment disclosed the 9o,ooo pages of material it obtained from Boies Schiller.? The\ngovernment’s due process violation warrants suppression. F.g., Raheem v. Kelly, 257 F.3d l22,\nl35 (2d Cir. 2ool) (suppression for due process violation).\n\nSecond, because the government violated Martindell not only by denying Maxwell notice\nand an opportunity to be heard, but also by affirmatively misleading Chief Judge McMahon,\n\n* To this day, Judge Preska—who is presiding over the Giuffre action since Judge Sweet’s\npassing and is addressing the Protective Order on a daily basis as the parties brief what material should be\nunsealed—apparently does not knou the Protective Order was modified.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3788", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004468.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l7l of 349\nconsidered that the USAO’s most pivotal decisions—to resolve the case through an NPA requiring\nEpstein to serve time in jail, register as a sexual offender, and provide monetary damages to\nvictims—had been made by July 3l, 2oo7, when the USAO presented its “term sheet” to the\ndefense. This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\n\nOs Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\nIdentified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\ninfluenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement\nauthorities.\n\nIn a declaration submited to the district court in 2ol7 in connection with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ... It is\n\nmy understanding from these and other discussions that these\n\nfactors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and\n\nthe various competing interests of the many different victims\n\n(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with\n\nthe Office’s desire to obtain a <span class=\"highlight\">guaranteed</span> sentence of incarceration\n\nfor Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested restitution for the victims,\nAcosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their\ncolleagues, was motivated by improper influences.\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4468", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004469.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l72 of 349\nand <span class=\"highlight\">guaranteed</span> sexual offender registration by Epstein . . . were\namong the factors [that led to the NPA].7!°\n\nDuring her OPR interview, Villafafia similarly described the victims’ general reluctance to\ngo forward with a trial:\n\n[W]hen we would meet with victims, we would ask them hou they\nwanted the case to be resolved. And most of them wanted the case\nto be resolved via a plea. Some of them wanted him not to be\nprosecuted at all. Most of them did not want to have to come to\ncourt and testify. They were very worried about their privacy\nrights.'°\n\nIn his writen response to OPR, Lourie stated that although he did not specifically recall\nthe issues Villafafia set forth in her declaration, he believed they would have been important to the\nUSAO in 2oo7. Lourie also told OPR that he generally recalled concerns within the USAO about\nthe charges and a potential trial:\n\n[M]y vague recollection is that I and others had concerns that there\n\nwas a substantial chance we would not prevail at both trial and on\n\nappeal after a conviction, resulting in no jail time, no criminal\n2l5 Doe v.

Marie Villafafia in Support of\nGovernment’s Response and Opposition to Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for\nSummary Judgment at 8-9 (June 2, 2ol7).\n2l8 These concerns are also reflected in a 2ol7 declaration filed by the FBI case agent in the CVRA litigation,\nin which she stated, “During interviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that\nEpstein be prosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s] victims... .\n\nA majority of the victims expressed concern about the possible disclosure of their\n\nidentities to the public. A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall, many of the\n\nvictims were troubled about the existence of the investigation. They displayed\n\nfeelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to\n\ninvestigators. Some victims who were identified through the investigation refused\n\neven to speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and geting to\n\nthe truth were always at the forefront of our handling of the investigation.\n\nIn addition, during the CVRA litigation, an atorney representing several victims filed a pleading to protect\nthe anonymity of his clients by preventing disclosure of their identities to the CVRA petitioners. See Response to\nCourt Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance (July 24, 2ol5). It is noteworthy that in\n2o2o, when OPR atempted to contact victims, through their counsel, for interviews or responses to writen questions\nregarding contacts with the USAO, OPR was informed that most of the victims were still deeply concerned about\nremaining anonymous.

We knou at least one other juror in addition to\nJuror No. 5o falsely denied having been a victim of sexual abuse or assault.\n\nAlthough this Court need not hold a hearing since the record already establishes that Ms.\nMaxwell was deprived of her Sixth Amendment right to trial by an impartial jury, any such\nhearing must also serve to identify this other juror. Such a hearing likely would also shou that\nJuror No. 5o was actually biased, in addition to being impliedly and inferably biased.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9875", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011441.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 732 Filed o7/l4/22 Page l8 of 25\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nNovember 22, 2o2l\nPage l8\n\nF. Compliance with the subpoena would not be unreasonable or oppressive.\n\nThree of the motions argue that compliance with the subpoena would be unreasonable\nand oppressive because the accusers were <span class=\"highlight\">guaranteed</span> confidentiality under the EVCP Protocol.\nEVCP Mot. at 9-l2; Accuser-2 Mot. at 4-6; Witness-3 Mot. at 2-3. The government does not\nmake such an argument. Gov. Mot. at l-6. Some motions even imply that the confidentiality of\nthe materials is reason enough to quash the subpoena. Accuser-2 Mot. at 4-6; Witness-3 Mot. at\n2-3,\n\nFirst, even if the materials are confidential, this Court cannot quash the subpoena on that\nbasis alone. Rule l7 addresses the process for subpoenaing “personal or confidential information\nabout a victim.” Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3). If confidential materials couldn’t be subpoenaed, Rule\nl7(c)(3) would be superfluous.\n\nIn fact, under the express language of Rule l7, the only difference between a subpoena\nfor confidential information and a subpoena for non-confidential information is that the former\ncan be issued “‘only by court order” with notice to the victim. Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3). The\nterms of Rule l7 do not require a heightened justification before a defendant can subpoena\nconfidential information, and they do not demand special treatment for motions to quash when\nconfidential information is at issue. Id.°\n\n® Courts in this district have even authorized defense subpoenas when the information\nsought is arguably privileged. E.g., United States v. Rajaratnam, 753 F. Supp. 2d 3l7, 324-25\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oll) (denying motion to quash defense subpoena for tax returns even though the\nreturns might be privileged, saying “cases demonstrate . . . a potential exception to the tax return\nprivilege where, as here, the interests in truth and a criminal defendant’s rights are both\nimplicated’’).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll44l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015321.jpg": "Invoice Number: 4-443-36929 *\n® Invoice Date: Nov o8, 2oo2\nAccount Number: 2292-o75o-4\nPage: 4oof4\nFedEx Ground Reference Chart\nSERVICE CODES FEDEX HOME DELIVERY SERVICE CODES ZONE DEFINITIONS\nFedEx Ground 8oo AutoPOD, Prepaid 2-8 Ground Service 48 contiguous states\n8o4 Prepaid 9 Service to Hawai\n8o8 Signature, Prepaid lo Service to Puerto Rico\nol5 — AutoPOD, Prepaid, Domestic 8lo Evening, AutoPOD, Prepaid l4 Service to Oahu\nol6 COD, Prepaid, Domestic 8l4 Evening, Prepaid l7 Service to Alaska\nol7 ECOD, Prepaid, Domestic 8l8 Evening, Signature, Prepaid 22 Service within Alaska\nol8 FedEx Ground, PRP, Prepaid, Domestic 82o Date Certain, AutoPOD, Prepaid 23 Service from Alaska\nol9 Prepaid, Domestic 824 Date Certain, Prepaid 25 Service from Alaska\no2o AutoPOD, Collect, Domestic 828 Date Certain, Signature, Prepaid 5l & 54 Service to Canada\no2l Collect, Domestic 83o Appointment, AutoPOD, Prepaid 92 & 96 Service from Hawai (Deferred)\no3o COD, Collect, Domestic 834 Appointment, Prepaid\no3l ECOD, Callect, Domestic 835 Adult AutoPOD, Prepaid\no32 Cash COD, Collect, Domestic 836 Adult Signature, Prepaid\no33 <span class=\"highlight\">Guaranteed</span> Funds COD, Collect, Domestic 837 Evening, AdultPOD, Prepaid\nl36 Ground, Prepaid, Return Manager 838 Evening, Adult Signature, Prepaid\n4o8 <span class=\"highlight\">Guaranteed</span> Funds COD, Prepaid, Domestic 839 Date Certain, Adult AutoPOD, Prepaid OTHER CHARGE CODE DEFINITIONS\n4o9 Cash COD, Prepaid, Domestic 84o _ Date Certain, Adult Signature, Prepaid\n4lo AutoPOD, COD, Prepaid, Domestic 84l Appointment, Adult Signature, Prepaid\n4ll AutoPOD, COD, Collect, Domestic 842 Appointment, AdultPOD, Prepaid (l) C.O.D.

Preska\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\n5oo Pearl Street\nNew York, NY looo7\nRe: August 3, 2o2o Order (Doc. lo96)\nGiuffre v. Ghislaine Maxwell, No. l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP)\nDear Judge Preska:\n\nI write in response to the Court’s Order of August 3, 2o2o (Doc. lo69), the Order and\nProtocol for Unsealing Decided Motions (Doc. lo44) (“Protocol”), and to raise with the Court\nthe legal effect of new information that came to the atention of counsel for Ms. Maxwell on\nFriday, August 7, 2o2o.\n\nNew information: On Friday, August 7, 2o2o, counsel for Ms. Maxwell learned of\ncritical new information that impacts both this action and U.S. v. Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n(the “Criminal Action”). The information implicates Ms. Maxwell’s right to due process and\nfairness in this civil action and affects the Second Circuit’s review of the Court’s unsealing\norder of July 23, 2o2o. Additionally, the information implicates her rights as a criminal\ndefendant <span class=\"highlight\">guaranteed</span> under the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\n\nCounsel makes the representations about implications of the new information as an\nofficer of this Court. At this time, counsel is not at liberty to disclose the information because\nit is subject to a protective order in the Criminal Action, which forbids its use “for any civil\nproceeding or any purpose other than the defense” of the criminal action absent “further order\nof the Court.” Protective Order, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN) at {¥ l(a), l8 (Exhibit A). As required by\nthat Protective Order and Judge Nathan’s Individual Practices in Criminal Cases, counsel\ninitiated a conferral with the U.S. Atorney’s Office over the weekend concerning a\nmodification of the Protective Order to share the information with this Court and the Second\nCircuit. Barring agreement, Ms. Maxwell intends to seek modification of the Protective Order\nin the Criminal Action from Judge Nathan forthwith to permit sharing the information with\nthis Court, ex parte and in camera if necessary, and with the Second Circuit (likewise under\nseal if necessary).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool932l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021344.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel72 of 258\nSA-l7o\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l7o of 348\nconsidered that the USAO’s most pivotal decisions—to resolve the case through an NPA requiring\nEpstein to serve time in jail, register as a sexual offender, and provide monetary damages to\nvictims—had been made by July 3l, 2oo7, when the USAO presented its “term sheet” to the\ndefense. This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\n3s Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\nIdentified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\ninfluenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement\nauthorities.\n\nIn a declaration submited to the district court in 2ol7 in connection with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ... It is\n\nmy understanding from these and other discussions that these\n\nfactors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and\n\nthe various competing interests of the many different victims\n\n(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with\n\nthe Office’s desire to obtain a <span class=\"highlight\">guaranteed</span> sentence of incarceration\n\nfor Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested restitution for the victims,\nAcosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their\ncolleagues, was motivated by improper influences.\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l344", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021345.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONT 3536o38, Pagel73 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l7l of 348\nand <span class=\"highlight\">guaranteed</span> sexual offender registration by Epstein . . . were\n\namong the factors [that led to the NPA].””°\n\nDuring her OPR interview, Villafafia similarly described the victims’ general reluctance to\ngo forward with a trial:\n\n[W]hen we would meet with victims, we would ask them hou they\nwanted the case to be resolved. And most of them wanted the case\nto be resolved via a plea. Some of them wanted him not to be\nprosecuted at all. Most of them did not want to have to come to\ncourt and testify. They were very worried about their privacy\nrights.7'©\n\nIn his writen response to OPR, Lourie stated that although he did not specifically recall\nthe issues Villafafia set forth in her declaration, he believed they would have been important to the\nUSAO in 2oo7. Lourie also told OPR that he generally recalled concerns within the USAO about\nthe charges and a potential trial:\n\n[M]y vague recollection is that I and others had concerns that there\n\nwas a substantial chance we would not prevail at both trial and on\n\nappeal after a conviction, resulting in no jail time, no criminal\n2l5 Doe v. United States, No. 9:o8-cv-8o736 (S.D. Fla.), Declaration of A. Marie Villafafia in Support of\nGovernment’s Response and Opposition to Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for\nSummary Judgment at 8-9 (June 2, 2ol7).\n2l6 These concerns are also reflected in a 2ol7 declaration filed by the FBI case agent in the CVRA litigation,\nin which she stated, “During interviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that\nEpstein be prosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s] victims... .\n\nA majority of the victims expressed concern about the possible disclosure of their\n\nidentities to the public. A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall, many of the\n\nvictims were troubled about the existence of the investigation. They displayed\n\nfeelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to\n\ninvestigators. Some victims who were identified through the investigation refused\n\neven to speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and geting to\n\nthe truth were always at the forefront of our handling of the investigation.\n\nIn addition, during the CVRA litigation, an atorney representing several victims filed a pleading to protect\nthe anonymity of his clients by preventing disclosure of their identities to the CVRA petitioners. See Response to\nCourt Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance (July 24, 2ol5). It is noteworthy that in\n2o2o, when OPR atempted to contact victims, through their counsel, for interviews or responses to writen questions\nregarding contacts with the USAO, OPR was informed that most of the victims were still deeply concerned about\nremaining anonymous. One victim described to OPR hou she became distraught when, during the USAO’s\ninvestigation, the FBI left a business card at her parents’ home and, as a result, her parents learned that she was a\nvictim of Epstein. At the time, the victim was a teenager; was “nervous, scared, and ashamed”; and did not want her\nparents to knou about the case.\n\nl45\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l345", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021428.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page256 of 258\nSA-254\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 254 of 348\ncamera memory cards seized by the PBPD in order to have them forensically examined for deleted\nimages that could contain child pornography.*”\n\nBy early April 2oo8, as the defense pursued its appeal to the Department’s Criminal\nDivision, Acosta predicted in an email to Villafafia and Sloman that federal charges against Epstein\nwere “more and more likely.” Villafafia asked Oosterban for help to “move this [Criminal\nDivision review] process along,” noting that the defense continued to undermine the government’s\ncase by deposing the victims “under the guise of ‘trial prep’ for the state case” and that the “agents\nand the victims” were “losing their patience.”\n\nOn April 24, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman and USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior\nasking whether she had the “green light” to file charges and raising the same concerns she had\nexpressed to Oosterban.

USAO SUPERVISORS CONSIDER CVRA OBLIGATIONS IN AN UNRELATED\n\nMATTER AND IN LIGHT OF A NEW FIFTH CIRCUIT OPINION\n\nDuring the period after the NPA was signed, and before Epstein complied with the NPA\nby entering his state guilty pleas, the USAO supervisors were explicitly made aware of a conflict\nbetween the Department’s position that CVRA’s victims’ rights atached upon the filing of a\ncriminal charge and a new federal appellate ruling to the contrary. The contemporaneous\ncommunications confirm that in 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman were aware of the Department’s policy\nregarding the issue.\n\nUnrelated to the Epstein investigation, on April l8, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman received a\ncitizen complaint from an atorney who requested to meet with them regarding his belief that the\nFlorida Bar had violated his First Amendment rights. The atorney asserted that the CVRA\n<span class=\"highlight\">guaranteed</span> him “an absolute right to meet” with USAO officials because he believed that he was\nthe victim of a federal crime. Acosta forwarded the message to the USAO Appellate Division\nChief, who informed Acosta and Sloman that, according to the 2oo5 Guidelines, “our obligations\nunder [the CVRA] are not triggered until charges are filed.” On April 24, 2oo8, the Appellate\nDivision Chief emailed Acosta and Sloman, stating that she had “confirmed with DOJ that [her]\nreading of [the 2oo5 Guidelines] is correct and that our obligations under [the CVRA] are not\ntriggered until a case is filed.”°\n\nOn May 7, 2oo8, the Appellate Division Chief sent Acosta and Sloman a copy of a U.S.\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit opinion issued that day, In re Dean, holding that a victim’s\nae The forensic examination did not locate useful evidence on the memory cards.\n\n343 The Appellate Division Chief advised Acosta that Acosta could inform the complainant that, prior to the\ninitiation of charges, the investigating agency was responsible for carrying out the Department’s statutory obligations\nto the victim.\n228\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l428", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023182.jpg": "considered that the USAO’s most pivotal decisions—to resolve the case through an NPA requiring\nEpstein to serve time in jail, register as a sexual offender, and provide monetary damages to\nvictims—had been made by July 3l, 2oo7, when the USAO presented its “term sheet” to the\ndefense. This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\nBs Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\nIdentified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\ninfluenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement\nauthorities.\n\nIn a declaration submited to the district court in 2ol7 in connection with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ... Itis\n\nmy understanding from these and other discussions that these\n\nfactors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and\n\nthe various competing interests of the many different victims\n\n(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with\n\nthe Office’s desire to obtain a <span class=\"highlight\">guaranteed</span> sentence of incarceration\n\nfor Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested restitution for the victims,\nAcosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their\ncolleagues, was motivated by improper influences.\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l82", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023183.jpg": "and <span class=\"highlight\">guaranteed</span> sexual offender registration by Epstein . . . were\namong the factors [that led to the NPA].7!>\n\nDuring her OPR interview, Villafafia similarly described the victims’ general reluctance to\ngo forward with a trial:\n\n[W]hen we would meet with victims, we would ask them hou they\nwanted the case to be resolved. And most of them wanted the case\nto be resolved via a plea. Some of them wanted him not to be\nprosecuted at all. Most of them did not want to have to come to\ncourt and testify. They were very worried about their privacy\nrights.7!°\n\nIn his writen response to OPR, Lourie stated that although he did not specifically recall\nthe issues Villafafia set forth in her declaration, he believed they would have been important to the\nUSAO in 2oo7. Lourie also told OPR that he generally recalled concerns within the USAO about\nthe charges and a potential trial:\n\n[M]y vague recollection is that I and others had concerns that there\n\nwas a substantial chance we would not prevail at both trial and on\n\nappeal after a conviction, resulting in no jail time, no criminal\n2l5 Doe v.

Marie Villafafia in Support of\nGovernment’s Response and Opposition to Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for\nSummary Judgment at 8-9 (June 2, 2ol7).\n2l6 These concerns are also reflected in a 2ol7 declaration filed by the FBI case agent in the CVRA litigation,\nin which she stated, “During interviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that\nEpstein be prosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s] victims ....\n\nA majority of the victims expressed concern about the possible disclosure of their\n\nidentities to the public. A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall, many of the\n\nvictims were troubled about the existence of the investigation. They displayed\n\nfeelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to\n\ninvestigators. Some victims who were identified through the investigation refused\n\neven to speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and geting to\n\nthe truth were always at the forefront of our handling of the investigation.\n\nIn addition, during the CVRA litigation, an atorney representing several victims filed a pleading to protect\nthe anonymity of his clients by preventing disclosure of their identities to the CVRA petitioners. See Response to\nCourt Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance (July 24, 2ol5).

This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\n3. Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\nIdentified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\ninfluenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement\nauthorities.\n\nIn a declaration submited to the district court in 2ol7 in connection with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ... It is\n\nmy understanding from these and other discussions that these\n\nfactors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and\n\nthe various competing interests of the many different victims\n\n(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with\n\nthe Office’s desire to obtain a <span class=\"highlight\">guaranteed</span> sentence of incarceration\n\nfor Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested restitution for the victims,\nAcosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their\ncolleagues, was motivated by improper influences.\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l82", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023183.tif": "and <span class=\"highlight\">guaranteed</span> sexual offender registration by Epstein . . . were\namong the factors [that led to the NPA].7!°\n\nDuring her OPR interview, Villafafia similarly described the victims’ general reluctance to\ngo forward with a trial:\n\n[W]hen we would meet with victims, we would ask them hou they\nwanted the case to be resolved. And most of them wanted the case\nto be resolved via a plea. Some of them wanted him not to be\nprosecuted at all. Most of them did not want to have to come to\ncourt and testify. They were very worried about their privacy\nrights.7!°\n\nIn his writen response to OPR, Lourie stated that although he did not specifically recall\nthe issues Villafafia set forth in her declaration, he believed they would have been important to the\nUSAO in 2oo7. Lourie also told OPR that he generally recalled concerns within the USAO about\nthe charges and a potential trial:\n\n[M]y vague recollection is that I and others had concerns that there\n\nwas a substantial chance we would not prevail at both trial and on\n\nappeal after a conviction, resulting in no jail time, no criminal\n2l5 Doe v. United States, No. 9:o8-cv-8o736 (S.D. Fla.), Declaration of A. Marie Villafafia in Support of\nGovernment’s Response and Opposition to Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for\nSummary Judgment at 8-9 (June 2, 2ol7).\n2l6 These concerns are also reflected in a 2ol7 declaration filed by the FBI case agent in the CVRA litigation,\nin which she stated, “During interviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that\nEpstein be prosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s] victims... .\n\nA majority of the victims expressed concern about the possible disclosure of their\n\nidentities to the public. A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall, many of the\n\nvictims were troubled about the existence of the investigation. They displayed\n\nfeelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to\n\ninvestigators. Some victims who were identified through the investigation refused\n\neven to speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and geting to\n\nthe truth were always at the forefront of our handling of the investigation.\n\nIn addition, during the CVRA litigation, an atorney representing several victims filed a pleading to protect\nthe anonymity of his clients by preventing disclosure of their identities to the CVRA petitioners. See Response to\nCourt Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance (July 24, 2ol5). It is noteworthy that in\n2o2o, when OPR atempted to contact victims, through their counsel, for interviews or responses to writen questions\nregarding contacts with the USAO, OPR was informed that most of the victims were still deeply concerned about\nremaining anonymous. One victim described to OPR hou she became distraught when, during the USAO’s\ninvestigation, the FBI left a business card at her parents’ home and, as a result, her parents learned that she was a\nvictim of Epstein. At the time, the victim was a teenager; was “nervous, scared, and ashamed”; and did not want her\nparents to knou about the case.\n\nl45\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l83", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023266.tif": "camera memory cards seized by the PBPD in order to have them forensically examined for deleted\nimages that could contain child pornography.*“”\n\nBy early April 2oo8, as the defense pursued its appeal to the Department’s Criminal\nDivision, Acosta predicted in an email to Villafafia and Sloman that federal charges against Epstein\nwere “more and more likely.” Villafafia asked Oosterban for help to “move this [Criminal\nDivision review] process along,” noting that the defense continued to undermine the government’s\ncase by deposing the victims “under the guise of ‘trial prep’ for the state case” and that the “agents\nand the victims” were “losing their patience.”\n\nOn April 24, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman and USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior\nasking whether she had the “green light” to file charges and raising the same concerns she had\nexpressed to Oosterban. Villafafia further cautioned that, although she was planning to file\ncharges on May 6, if that was not going to happen, “then we all need to meet with the victims, the\nagents, and the police officers to decide hou the case will be resolved and to provide them with an\nexplanation for the delay.” Because the Department’s Criminal Division did not conclude its\nreview of Epstein’s appeal by May 6, houever, Villafafia did not file charges that day.\n\nVill. USAO SUPERVISORS CONSIDER CVRA OBLIGATIONS IN AN UNRELATED\n\nMATTER AND IN LIGHT OF A NEW FIFTH CIRCUIT OPINION\n\nDuring the period after the NPA was signed, and before Epstein complied with the NPA\nby entering his state guilty pleas, the USAO supervisors were explicitly made aware of a conflict\nbetween the Department’s position that CVRA’s victims’ rights atached upon the filing of a\ncriminal charge and a new federal appellate ruling to the contrary. The contemporaneous\ncommunications confirm that in 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman were aware of the Department’s policy\nregarding the issue.\n\nUnrelated to the Epstein investigation, on April l8, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman received a\ncitizen complaint from an atorney who requested to meet with them regarding his belief that the\nFlorida Bar had violated his First Amendment rights. The atorney asserted that the CVRA\n<span class=\"highlight\">guaranteed</span> him “an absolute right to meet” with USAO officials because he believed that he was\nthe victim of a federal crime. Acosta forwarded the message to the USAO Appellate Division\nChief, who informed Acosta and Sloman that, according to the 2oo5 Guidelines, “our obligations\nunder [the CVRA] are not triggered until charges are filed.” On April 24, 2oo8, the Appellate\nDivision Chief emailed Acosta and Sloman, stating that she had “confirmed with DOJ that [her]\nreading of [the 2oo5 Guidelines] is correct and that our obligations under [the CVRA] are not\ntriggered until a case is filed.”34°\n\nOn May 7, 2oo8, the Appellate Division Chief sent Acosta and Sloman a copy of a U.S.\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit opinion issued that day, /n re Dean, holding that a victim’s\nae The forensic examination did not locate useful evidence on the memory cards.\n\n343 The Appellate Division Chief advised Acosta that Acosta could inform the complainant that, prior to the\ninitiation of charges, the investigating agency was responsible for carrying out the Department’s statutory obligations\nto the victim.\n228\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23266", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00029057.tif": "- _ Prince Andrew and girl, l7, who sex offender friend flew to Britain to meet him j Mail On...
