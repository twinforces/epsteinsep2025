The case proceeded to trial and the jury\nfound Maxwell guilty on, inter alia, Count Six.\n(App.39). She was sentenced to a 24o month (2o year)\nterm of incarceration.

Instead, “the NPA makes clear that\nif Epstein fulfilled his obligations, he would no longer\nface charges in that district.” (App.9, emphasis in\noriginal). The use of narrouing terms as to Epstein’s\nprotections, not but not as to co-conspirator protec-\ntions, demonstrates that the difference was inten-\ntional.

In one of the earlier\ndrafts, the government proposed language that the\nco-conspirator protection would be limited to the\nSouthern District of Florida. (App.ll7). Yet the final\ndraft eliminated the limitation to the Southern\nDistrict of Florida and referred only to the United\nStates. (App.l22-24). The OPR report found that gov-\nernment witnesses (who were the only witnesses OPR\nspoke to) believed the co-conspirator clause was in-\ntended to provide transactional immunity. (App.l28-\nl29).

Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 5\n\nIndeed, while the defendant has still not filled out a financial affidavit, under penalty of\nperjury, in connection with his application for bail, his token effort to account for his finances\nmakes painfully clear the need for detention. The defendant reports having an extraordinary\namount of money in both total assets and cash or cash-equivalent holdings. And while the\ndefendant repeatedly represents in his Release Motion that his assets are “in the United States,”\nthere is absolutely nothing in the defendant’s minimal financial submission to verify that.\n\nIndeed, and as discussed further belou, even assuming the defendant’s assets are presently\nin the United States, nothing in the proposed package would prevent the defendant from\ntransferring liquid assets out of the country quickly and in anticipation of flight or relocation. The\ndefendant is an incredibly sophisticated financial actor with decades of experience in the industry\nand significant ties to financial institutions and actors around the world. He could easily transfer\nfunds and holdings on a moment’s to places where the Government would never find them so as\nto ensure he could live comfortably while a fugitive.\n\nBut perhaps most important, even were the defendant to sacrifice /iterally all of his current\nassets, there is every indication that he would immediately be able to resume making millions or\ntens of millions of dollars per year outside of the United States. He already earns at least\n$lo,ooo,ooo per year, according to records from Institution-l, while living in the U.S. Virgin\nIslands, traveling extensively abroad, and residing in part in Paris, France; there would be litle to\nstop the defendant from fleeing, transferring his unknoun assets abroad, and then continuing to do\nwhatever it is he does to earn his vast wealth from a computer terminal beyond the reach of\nextradition.*\n\nThat the defendant faces up to 45 years of incarceration on the current counts with which\nhe is charged provides the motive for him do so and is another significant factor in assessing the\nrisk of flight. See United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 7 (2d Cir. l987). So too is the strength of\nthe evidence, detailed above and in the Government’s Detention Memo. Indeed, that evidence,\nalready robust less than a week ago when the Indictment was unsealed, is grouing stronger by the\nday. Just since the Indictment was unsealed, several additional women, in multiple jurisdictions,\nhave identified themselves to the Government as having been victimized by the defendant when\nthey were minors. Moreover, pursuant to judicially-authorized search warrants, the Government\nhas discovered and seized a significant volume of photographs of nude and seminude young\nwomen and girls in the defendant’s Manhatan residence, and is in the process of reviewing dozens\nof electronic discs that contain still more such photos.*> And dozens of individuals have called the\nGovernment in recent days to convey information regarding the defendant and the allegations\n* As noted in the Government’s Detention Memo, the defendant is a frequent traveler and regularly\ntravels to and from the United States, including approximately more than 2o flights in which he\ntraveled to or from a foreign country since 2ol8 alone. <span class=\"highlight\">Extensive</span> international travel of this nature\nfurther demonstrates a significant risk of flight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp.\n2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2oo5).\n> The Government’s review of these materials, seized earlier this week, remains ongoing.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo333", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000339.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page ll of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage ll\n\nB. Danger to Obstruct Justice\n\nThe defendant has also already demonstrated a willingness to use intimidation and\naggressive tactics in connection with a criminal investigation. Far from being “musty,” Release\nMotion at 6 n.6, the defendant’s past behavior in connection with being investigated for sexually\nabusing children is the best predictor of his likely incentives and activities in connection with being\ncharged with sexually abusing children. For example, in the incident the defendant nou claims\nwas not atributable to or authorized by him, the contemporaneous police report indicates that\npressure tactics were at the very least coordinated closely with individuals in the defendant’s orbit.\nSee Palm Beach Police Report (the “Police Report’) (Ex. B). According to the Police Report, the\nparent of one of the defendant’s victims was driven off the road by a private investigator. The\nPolice Report provides further information regarding victim and witness threats and intimidation\nreported against an individual who was directly in contact with an assistant of the defendant,\nfolloued “immediately” by a call to that same individual from a phone number associated with the\ndefendant’s businesses and associates.\n\nSeparately, and in addition, there are also <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> allegations of obstruction and\ntampering in connection with civil lawsuits brought against the defendant follouing his 2oo8\nconviction. See Doe v. United States, o8 Civ. 8o736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkt. 29l-l5 at 2l-23, 3l.\nMoreover, police reports suggest that an associate of Epstein’s was offering to buy victims’ silence\nduring the course of the prior investigation. Specifically, one victim reported that “she was\npersonally contacted through a source that has maintained contact with Epstein,” who “assured\n[the victim] that she would receive monetary compensation for her assistance in not cooperating\nwith law enforcement.” Indeed, the victim reported having been told: “Those who help him will\nbe compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with.”’ See Palm Beach Police Report\n(Ex. C).\n\nAnd Epstein’s efforts to influence witnesses continue to this day. As in the past, within\nrecent months. he paid significant amounts of money to influence individuals who were close to\nhim during the time period charged in this case and who might be witnesses against him at a trial.\nBy way of background, on or about November 28, 2ol8, the Miami Herald began publishing a\nseries of articles relating to the defendant, his conduct, and the circumstances of his prior\nconviction and the non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”). Records obtained by the Government\nfrom Institution-l appear to shou that just two days later, on or about November 3o, 2ol8, the\ndefendant wired $loo,ooo from a trust account he controlled to an individual named as a possible\nco-conspirator in the NPA. The same records appear to shou that just three days after that, on or\nabout December 3, 2ol8, the defendant wired $25o,ooo from the same trust account to another\nindividual named as a possible co-conspirator in the NPA and also identified as one of the\ndefendant’s employees in the Indictment. Neither of these payments appears to be recurring or\nrepeating during the approximately five years of bank records presently available to the\nGovernment. This course of action, and in particular its timing, suggests the defendant was\natempting to further influence co-conspirators who might provide information against him in light\nof the recently re-emerging allegations\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo339", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000345.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page3oflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage 3\n\nAs has been widely reported, the defendant is extraordinarily wealthy, and he ouns and\nmaintains luxury properties and residences around the world, including in Manhatan, New York;\nPalm Beach, Florida; Stanley, New Mexico; and Paris, France. Additionally, Epstein ouns a\nprivate island in the U.S. Virgin Islands which, as noted above, is believed to be his primary\nresidence in the United States. His mansion in Manhatan alone—a multi-story tounhouse\nreported to be one of the largest single residences in all of Manhatan, which previously housed a\nschool and which he ouns through an LLC—has been valued at approximately $77 million.\nEntities controlled by the defendant also oun at least two private jets in active service, at least one\nof which is capable of intercontinental travel.\n\nAs described further belou, the defendant possesses three active United States passports,\nand his international connections and travels are <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>. For example, in addition to\nmaintaining a residence in Paris, France, as described above, in the past l8 months alone, the\ndefendant has traveled abroad, via private jet, either into or out of the country on approximately\nmore than 2o occasions.\n\nC. The Prior Florida Investigation\n\nIn or about 2oo5, the defendant was investigated by local police in Palm Beach, Florida, in\nconnection with allegations that he had commited similar sex offenses against minor girls. The\ninvestigation ultimately also involved federal authorities, namely the U.S. Atorney’s Office for\nthe Southern District of Florida (“SDFL”) and the FBI’s Miami Office, and included interviews\nwith victims based in the Palm Beach area, including some of the alleged victims relevant to Count\nOne of the instant Indictment.\"\n\nIn fall 2oo7, the defendant entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the SDFL in\nconnection with the conduct at issue in that investigation, which the non-prosecution agreement\nidentified as including investigations into the defendant’s abuse of minor girls in the Palm Beach\narea. The Southern District of New York was not a signatory to that agreement, and the defendant\nwas never charged federally.” In June 2oo8, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count\nof procuring a person under the age of l8 for prostitution, a felony, and one count of solicitation\nof prostitution, a felony. As a result, the defendant was designated as a sex offender with\nregistration requirements under the national Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act.\n\n' The non-prosecution agreement, further discussed belou, was entered into at the conclusion of\nthe SDFL investigation and did not purport to cover any victims outside of the State of Florida.\nAs noted above, the instant Indictment expressly alleges the existence of dozens of victims who\nwere abused in this District in addition to dozens of victims who were abused in Florida.\n\n> While beyond the scope of a bail hearing, as discussed further belou, it is well-established in the\nSecond Circuit that absent an express provision to the contrary in the agreement, one District is\nnot bound by the terms of an agreement entered into between a defendant and a U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice in another district.

The prior NPA included a list of several dozen victims\nidentified in the prior investigation, all of whom were abused in the State of Florida, and none of\nwhom are a part of the conduct charged in Count Two of the instant Indictment.\n\nEach of these factors—the seriousness of the allegations, the strength of the evidence, and\nthe possibility of lengthy incarceration—creates an extraordinary incentive to flee. And as further\ndescribed belou, the defendant has the means and money to do so.\n\n2. The Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe history and characteristics of the defendant also strongly support detention. The\ndefendant is extraordinarily wealthy and has access to vast financial resources to fund any atempt\nto flee. Indeed, his potential avenues of flight from justice are practically limitless.\n\nAs the defendant acknouledged in his most recent New York State sex offender\nregistration, he has six residences, including two in the U.S. Virgin Islands (including his oun\nprivate island), and one each in Palm Beach, Florida; Paris, France; New York, New York; and\nStanley, New Mexico. The most recent estimated value of the defendant’s New York City mansion\nalone is more than $77 million. The most recent tax-assessed value of the defendant’s Palm Beach\nestate is more than $l2 million. The defendant’s primary residence is a private island in the U.S.\nVirgin Islands, a place where any sort of meaningful supervision would be all but impossible.\n\nMoreover, the defendant has access to innumerable means to flee. His sex registration\ndocumentation of “current vehicles” lists no fewer than l5 motor vehicles, including seven\nChevrolet Suburbans, a cargo van, a Range Rover, a Mercedez-Benz sedan, a Cadillac Escalade,\nand a Hummer I]. These cars are registered in various states and territories including the Virgin\nIslands, New York, Florida, and New Mexico. The defendant also has access to two private jets,\ngiving him the ability to leave the country secretly and on a moment’s notice and to go virtually\nanywhere he wants to travel. He is a very frequent international traveler and regularly travels to\nand from the United States by private plane. In particular, between January l, 2ol8, and the\npresent, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has logged approximately more than 2o flights in which\nEpstein was traveling to or from a foreign country. Indeed, he was arrested at Teterboro Airport\narriving on just such a private international flight after having spent approximately three weeks\nabroad. <span class=\"highlight\">Extensive</span> international travel of this nature further demonstrates a significant risk of\nflight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp. 2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2oo5). There can be\nno assurance that, upon release, the defendant would suddenly lack access to such means of travel.\n\nFinally, the defendant has no meaningful ties that would keep him in this country. The\ndefendant has no knoun immediate family. He is not married and has no children. He has friends\nand associates worldwide, as demonstrated by his <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> international travel, and his\nprofessional obligations, if any, can and seemingly are plainly capable of being handled by the\ndefendant remotely. Simply put, there would be no meaningful reason for the defendant to remain\nin the country, while he would have every incentive (and every resource needed) to flee.\n\nNor would home confinement with electronic monitoring reasonably assure the\ndefendant’s presence as required. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo349", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000352.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page looflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage lo\nCONCLUSION\nAs set forth above, in this case, the risk of flight in this case is extraordinarily real. The\ndefendant is extremely wealthy, has <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> foreign contacts, and is charged with serious\noffenses that carry a potential statutory sentence of up to 45 years’ imprisonment—even a fraction\nof which could result in the defendant, who is 66 years old, spending the rest of his life in jail. In\nsum, the defendant’s transient lifestyle, his lack of family or community ties, his <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>\ninternational travel and ties outside the country, and his vast wealth, including his access to and\nounership of private planes, all provide the defendant with the motive and means to become a\nsuccessful fugitive. Further, the nature of the offenses he is alleged to have perpetrated—the abuse\ndozens of underage, vulnerable girls—along with his demonstrated willingness to harass,\nintimidate and otherwise tamper with victims and other potential witnesses against him, render his\ndangerousness readily apparent.\nAccordingly, the Government respectfully submits that the defendant cannot and will not\nbe able to meet his burden of overcoming the strong presumption in favor of detention, that there\nare no conditions of bail that would assure the defendant’s presence in court proceedings in this\ncase or protect the safety of the community, and that any application for bail should be denied.\nVery truly yours,\nGEOFHREY S.

The Court finds that the Government has shoun by a preponderance\nof the evidence that Mr. Epstein is a flight risk. |\nThe factors to be considered in analyzing risk of flight are the same factors that apply |\nwhen analyzing dangerousness. They are: (l) the nature and circumstances of the crimes |\ncharged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the defendant; (3) the history and characteristics |\nof the defendant, including the person’s character and financial resources; and (4) “the |\nseriousness of the danger posed by the defendant’s release.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g). “The weight |\nafforded to each factor under section 3l42(g) is within the ‘special province’ of the district |\ncourt.” Paulino, 335 F.

As a result of her disturbing and callous conduct, Maxwell nou faces the very real\nprospect of serving many years in prison. The strength of the Government’s evidence and the\nsubstantial prison term the defendant would face upon conviction all create a strong incentive for\nthe defendant to flee. That risk is only amplified by the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> international ties,\nher citizenship in two foreign countries, her wealth, and her lack of meaningful ties to the United\nStates. In short, Maxwell has three passports, large sums of money, <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> international\nconnections, and absolutely no reason to stay in the United States and face the possibility of a\nlengthy prison sentence.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo947", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000952.jpg": "Case l24 O/CRODBBOHAEN 2OdcUMENt/2o FilecOOAGH2o2 P ahage of aiooo\n\ndate of the amendment,! to permit a prosecution at any point during the lifetime of the minor\nvictim.

Pierre-Louis,\nNo. l6 Cr. 54l (CM), 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8) (same). Moreover, while\nthe conduct alleged in the Indictment may have occurred years ago, the risk of a significant term\nof incarceration — and thus the motive to flee — is of course only very recent.\n\nEach of these factors — the seriousness of the allegations, the strength of the evidence, and\nthe possibility of lengthy incarceration — creates an extraordinary incentive to flee. And as further\ndescribed belou, the defendant has the means and money to do so.\n\nB. The Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe history and characteristics of the defendant also strongly support detention. As an\ninitial mater, the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> international ties would make it exceptionally easy for her\nto flee and live abroad. The defendant was born in France and raised in the United Kingdom,\nwhere she atended school. Although she became a naturalized citizen of the United States in\n2oo2, she also remains a citizen of the United Kingdom and France. Travel records from\nUnited States Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) reflect that she has engaged in frequent\ninternational travel, including at least fifteen international flights in the last three years to locations\nincluding the United Kingdom, Japan, and Qatar. In addition, CBP records reflect that, consistent\nwith her citizenship status, the defendant appears to possess passports from the United States,\nFrance, and the United Kingdom.\n\n' Prior to the amendment, the statute of limitations for sexual offenses involving minors ran until\nthe victim reached the age of 25, and as such, all of the relevant charges in the Indictment\nremained timely as of the 2oo3 amendment described above.\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo952", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000991.jpg": "Cased 2o-€f Qo36Go4AUt Dibeu tet 22o 2F il e@ OFAL8) 26a geageo’ 2o9\ncharges conduct not covered by the NPA, which was limited by its terms to conduct spanning from\n2ool to 2oo7, a time period that post-dates the conduct charged in the Indictment, and to violations\nof statutes not charged in this Indictment. In this respect, the Government further notes that the\nIndictment brought in this District is entirely independent of the prior SDFL investigation, and two\nof the victims referenced in the Indictment were never approached or interviewed by the SDFL,\nand had never spoken to law enforcement until they met with our Office in 2ol9.\n\nNor is there any force to the defendant’s assertion — without explanation, much less legal\nauthority — that the charges in the Indictment are untimely. As the Government explained in its\nopening brief, the charges in this case are timely, pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3283, which permits the\nprosecution of crimes involving the sexual abuse of minors at any time during the life of the victim.\nThe defendant’s claim that the Indictment is barred by the statute of limitations has no basis in\nlaw. For similar reasons, the Court should not give any weight to the defendant’s bare assertions\nthat the indictment is somehou “legally flawed” in unspecified ways or that the perjury counts are\n“subject to dismissal” for unspecified reasons. Opposition Memorandum at l9. These conclusory\nclaims are baseless.\n\nIll. The Defendant Poses An Extreme Risk of Flight\n\nAs the Government detailed in its opening brief, the defendant’s international ties,\nconsiderable financial resources, and transient lifestyle all make her a risk of flight. That risk is\nfurther exacerbated by the fact that the defendant is a citizen of France, which does not extradite\nits citizens to the United States pursuant to French law. In addition, and as detailed further belou,\nthe defendant has not only the motive to flee, but the means to do so swiftly and effectively. The\ndefendant appears to have access to <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> sources of wealth. She does not have a job that\nwould tie her to the United States, much less the Southern District of New York, and she does not\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo99l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000994.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-oo BRGY DON 22o FilesoOAI3o2 aPage dlo26lol9\nspent the last two decades without facing consequences for her criminal actions. For years before\nher arrest in this case, the defendant likely believed she had goten away with her crimes. That\nillusion has nou been shatered, and she has a host of new reasons to use her considerable resources\nto flee.\n\nMoreover, the defendant’s willingness to brazenly lie under oath about her conduct,\nincluding some of the conduct charged in the Indictment, strongly suggests her true motive has\nbeen and remains to avoid being held accountable for her crimes, rather than to avoid the media.\nAs alleged in the Indictment, in 2ol6, when the defendant was given the opportunity to address\nher conduct with minors in the context ofa civil suit, she lied repeatedly. Those lies are, of course,\nthe subject of two counts of perjury, and they evidence her willingness to flout the law in order to\nprotect herself. The defendant’s lies under oath should give the Court serious pause about trusting\nthis defendant to comply with conditions of bail.\n\nIV. The Defendant’s Bail Proposal Offers No Security For Her Appearance\n\nIn its opening memorandum, the Government highlighted the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> means\nto flee and her opaque finances. In her response, the defendant’s brief provides zero information\nabout her assets in the United States or abroad. The Court should be troubled by this. First, so\nfar as the Government is aware, the defendant has not filled out a financial affidavit, under penalty\nof perjury, in connection with her application for bail, meaning that the Court has no reliable\ninsight into the magnitude or scope of the defendant’s resources. Houever, what the Court does\nhave are strong indicia that the defendant has access to enormous resources, including the large\nproperty she was found on, the private security guard being retained to live with her on that\n* The Government understands from Pretrial Services that the defendant has indicated that she has\nless than a million dollars in bank accounts. The report has not yet been released. As discussed\nbelou, the Court should have serious pause before accepting this unverified information.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo994", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000995.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-ooBaGusnt DOM 2o FilecoOAI3o2P aPage afL2siol9\nproperty, and the multi-million dollar property in the United Kingdom being offered as collateral.\nIndeed, it is revealing that the defendant’s memorandum declines to discuss her assets or the assets\nto which she plainly has access. Without knouing the full scope of the defendant’s financial\nresources, it would be impossible for the Court to even begin to evaluate whether conditions of\nbail would mitigate her risk of flight. More importantly, the defendant cannot claim that she has\nmet her significant burden to rebut the presumption of detention in this case when she has failed\nto provide comprehensive, verified financial information under penalty of perjury.\n\nAlthough the Government submits that no conditions of bail could reasonably assure the\ndefendant’s continued appearance, the defendant’s proposed bail package offers almost no security\nwhatsoever. The defendant appears to have significant assets, she has <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> foreign ties and\nis a citizen of a country that does not extradite its citizens to the United States, and she is charged\nwith serious crimes involving the sexual exploitation of minors — and yet, she asks the Court to\ngrant her bail secured only by a foreign property, which provides effectively no security at all.\n\nIndeed, it is curious that a defendant who appears to have access to millions of dollars has\nnot offered to post a single dime as collateral for the bond she proposes. Instead, as noted, she\noffers as security a foreign property, which is effectively meaningless. As a practical mater, the\nGovernment has no direct way to proceed against foreign property or sureties through bail\nforfeiture, because the Government cannot seize a foreign citizen’s assets abroad or sell property\nin another nation based on a United States bail forfeiture judgment. The Government would be\nrequired to atempt to litigate a property dispute in another country, with a lengthy process and an\nuncertain outcome.\n\nAdditionally, the defendant proffers no information about her proposed co-signers other\nthan that they are friends and relatives — in particular, she provides no information about the assets\nlo\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo995", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000998.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-ooBaGuisnt DOM 22o FilesoOAI3o2 aPage aM26lol9\na country that does not extradite its citizens, has access to untold financial resources, and has every\nmotivation to escape accountability for her appalling crimes.

Zarrab, No. l5 Cr. 867 (RMB), 2ol6 WL\n368 l423, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6)). The defendant’s proposed bail package is essentially\nnothing more than an unenforceable promise to return to Court. Given the gravity of the charged\ncrimes, the defendant’s substantial resources, her willingness to evade detection, and her lies under\noath, the Court should take the proposed bail package for what it is worth: nothing.\nV. The COVID-l9 Pandemic Does Not Warrant The Defendant’s Release\n\nFinally, the current pandemic is not a reason to release this defendant. Indeed, courts in\nthis district have regularly rejected applications for release based on assertions about the\ngeneralized risks of COVID-l9. See, e.g., United States v. Paulino, No. l9 Cr. 54 (PGG), 2o2o\nWL l8479l4, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. l3, 2o2o) (Gardephe, J.)

And the data—\nthough limited—suggests that these measures have been quite effective in containing COVID-l9\nthus far.”).\n\nNumerous judges in this District have rejected applications for release based on assertions\nabout the hypothetical risks of COVID-l9, including multiple cases involving defendants who,\nunlike this defendant, suffer from underlying health conditions. See, e.g., United States v. Hanes-\nCalugaru, No. l9 Cr. 65l, ECF No. 257 (S.D.N.Y. May 4, 2o2o) (Swain, J.)

In its writen\nand oral submissions, the defense urged the Court to release the defendant on bail.\n\nAmong other things, the defense emphasized the defendant’s family ties and residence in\nthe United States (Dkt. l8 at 2, 3, l2), offered to hire a private security company to monitor the\ndefendant (/d. at 2o), noted that the defendant remained in the country and was in touch with the\nGovernment through counsel follouing Epstein’s arrest (Dkt. l8 at l2-l3; Tr. 49, 52-55), argued\nthat the defendant went into hiding to avoid a media frenzy (Dkt. l8 at l4-l6; Tr. 55-56), and\nargued that detention would hamper the ability to prepare a defense (Tr. 42, 67-69). Responding\nto the Government’s concerns about the lack of transparency about the defendant’s finances and\nsix proposed co-signers, the defense specifically asked the Court to keep the proceedings open if\nthe Court believed additional information or a more fulsome bond would be useful to the bail\ndetermination. (Tr. 52 (“And if the court determines that the conditions that we have proffered are\ninsufficient or need further verification, as long as we can have some assurance of safety and\nconfidentiality, we would recommend that the court keep the proceeding open, and we should be\nable to get whatever the court needs to satisfy it.”); Tr. 59 (“Even if the court were to assume for\npurposes of today’s proceeding that she has the means that the government claims she does, it does\nnot affect the analysis.

But, as\ncorroborative documents refer only to Epstein, they still support these victims’ testimony, which\nwill detail their interactions with both the defendant and her co-conspirator, Epstein.

The bulk of the\narguments in the Renewed Bail Motion focus on this factor in a manner that largely rehashes claims\nthat this Court already considered at the July l4, 2o2o hearing.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in opposition to the defendant’s third\nmotion for release on bail, dated February 23, 2o2l (the “Third Bail Motion” or the “Motion’”).\n(Dkt. No. l6o). On July l4, 2o2o, after <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> briefing and a lengthy hearing, this Court\nconcluded that the defendant posed a serious flight risk and that no condition or combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance in court. On December 28, 2o2o, after the defendant\nrenewed her motion for release on bail (the “Second Bail Motion”) by essentially restating her\nprior arguments and presenting a more significant and specific bail package, this Court issued a\nthorough opinion and again concluded that the defendant “plainly poses a risk of flight” and denied\nthe motion for “substantially the same reasons that the Court denied” her first motion for release.\n(Dkt. No. lo6 at l-2 (“Dec. Op.”)). The defendant appealed this Court’s December 2o2o decision\nto the Second Circuit, and that appeal remains pending. Nou, the defendant asks the Court yet\nagain to reconsider its decision, and proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the bail\npackage the Court previously considered and rejected. For the reasons set forth belou, the Motion\nshould be denied. First, the Court does not have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion—in\nwhich she asks this Court to reconsider its December opinion—because the defendant has appealed\nthat December opinion to the Second Circuit. Second, even assuming the Court had jurisdiction\nto grant this latest bail application, the Court should adhere to its prior rulings because the\ndefendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and the additional bail conditions proposed\nby the defendant do not justify reversal of the Court’s prior findings that no combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion should be denied.\n\nI. Background\n\nThe Government’s December l6, 2o2o opposition to the defendant’s Second Bail Motion\ndetails the background of the initial bail proceedings in this case and is incorporated by reference\nherein. (See Dkt. No. loo at 2-6).

Rather than suggest conditions to satisfy its concerns, the\ngovernment urges the Court to summarily reject the proposed monitorship.\n\nWilliam S. Duffey, Jr., a retired federal district court judge and the former United\nStates Atorney for the Northern District of Georgia, has agreed to undertake appointment by\nthe Court as asset monitor. Judge Duffey has <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> experience evaluating and monitoring\nfunds held in and disbursed from financial accounts. He has agreed to serve by appointment of\nthe Court in a capacity similar to other trustees and receivers who serve as officers of the Court\nand are entrusted, pursuant to court order, with oversight authority to restrain, monitor, and\napprove disbursement of assets requiring his signature. Similar to others who have been\nappointed by courts to oversee financial maters, Judge Duffey will be compensated at the same\nhourly rate billed for his services as an ADR panelist for Federal Arbitration (FedArb).\n\nThe proceeds from the sale of Ms. Maxwell’s London home will be restrained and\nmonitored by Judge Duffey. As required by court order, documentation concerning the\nproceeds of the sale will be provided to Judge Duffey and the funds will be deposited in the\nfinancial account approved by Judge Duffey.\n\nThe government tries to steer the Court’s atention to allegations of Ms. Maxwell’s lack\nof candor to dissuade the Court from considering the proposed monitorship as a meaningful\nrestraint on the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse.

The Government submits that the decision of whether temporary release\nis “necessary” is a mixed question of law and fact which, like the district court’s bail\ndetermination, should be reviewed for clear error. See United States v. Matis, 963\nF.3d 285, 29l (2d Cir. 2o2o).

(Dkt. No. ll7). In particular, MDC legal counsel\nasks the Court to vacate its January l5, 2o2l order directing the MDC to permit the defendant to\nuse a laptop to review discovery on weekends and holidays. While the Government has no\nobjection to the defendant’s request for additional laptop access, the Government also generally\ndefers to the MDC regarding hou it manages its inmate population. The Government will continue\nto defer to the MDC here, particularly because the defendant has had ample access to discovery\neven without laptop access on weekends and holidays.\n\nGiven the volume of discovery in this case, which totals more than two million pages, the\nGovernment and the MDC have both made significant efforts to ensure that the defendant has\n<span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> access to her discovery materials. Since the Government made its first discovery\nproduction in August 2o2o, the defendant has had exclusive access to a BOP desktop computer in\nthe MDC on which to review her discovery. When the defendant complained of technical issues\nreviewing portions of her discovery on that desktop computer, the Government produced\nreformated copies of discovery materials and instructions regarding hou to open particular files.\nBecause the defendant continued to complain that she was unable to review certain discovery files\non the desktop computer, the Government agreed to provide a laptop for the defendant to use in\nher review of discovery. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government hand delivered the laptop to\nthe MDC for the defendant’s exclusive use.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has received, and continues to receive more time to\nreview her discovery than any other inmate at the MDC. In particular, the MDC permits the\ndefendant to review discovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. On weekdays, the\nMDC permits the defendant to use the laptop during her thirteen hours of daily review time. On\nweekends and holidays, the MDC would ordinarily only allou the defendant to use the BOP\ndesktop computer, which provides access to much of the discovery material. While, as noted\nabove, the Government has no particular objection to the defendant’s request for weekend access\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool355", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001445.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 73, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Paged of 24\n\nlo. As the Government has explained in oral and writen proffers,\nthe allegations in the Indictment are supported by the detailed, credible testimony of\nthree different victim-witnesses. (See, e.g., Ex.

Each\nvictim-witness’s testimony is not only corroborated by that of the other victim-\nwitnesses, but also by the testimony of other witnesses and documentary evidence,\nincluding flight records, diary entries, and other evidence. (See Ex. A at 5; Ex. F\nat lo-l2).\n\nll. Maxwell has made three separate bail applications to the District\nCourt, each of which was thoroughly briefed. Judge Nathan denied all three\napplications in careful and thorough decisions.\n\nl2. First, after receiving <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> writen submissions from the\nparties (Ex. A, B, C), Judge Nathan held a bail hearing on July l4, 2o2o, at which\nshe heard lengthy oral argument and received statements from two victims. Judge\nNathan ultimately ordered Maxwell detained on the basis of risk of flight and\nexplained her reasoning in a detailed oral ruling. (Ex. D at 79-9l). In reaching\nthis decision, Judge Nathan found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense\nhere weigh in favor of detention” (id. at 82), “[t]he government’s evidence at this\nearly juncture of the case appears strong” (id.), and Maxwell’s history and\ncharacteristics demonstrate that she poses a risk of flight (id. at 83).

As a result of her disturbing and callous conduct, Maxwell nou faces the very real\nprospect of serving many years in prison. The strength of the Government’s evidence and the\nsubstantial prison term the defendant would face upon conviction all create a strong incentive for\nthe defendant to flee. That risk is only amplified by the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> international ties,\nher citizenship in two foreign countries, her wealth, and her lack of meaningful ties to the United\nStates. In short, Maxwell has three passports, large sums of money, <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> international\nconnections, and absolutely no reason to stay in the United States and face the possibility of a\nlengthy prison sentence.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooool488", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001493.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document4 _ Filed o7/o2/2o Page 7 of lo\ndate of the amendment, to permit a prosecution at any point during the lifetime of the minor\nvictim. See United States v. Chief, 438 F.3d 92o, 922-25 (9th Cir. 2oo6) (finding that because\nCongress extended the statute of limitations for sex offenses involving minors during the time the\nprevious statute was still running, the extension was permissible); United States v. Pierre-Louis,\nNo. l6 Cr. 54l (CM), 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8) (same). Moreover, while\nthe conduct alleged in the Indictment may have occurred years ago, the risk of a significant term\nof incarceration — and thus the motive to flee — is of course only very recent.\n\nEach of these factors — the seriousness of the allegations, the strength of the evidence, and\nthe possibility of lengthy incarceration — creates an extraordinary incentive to flee. And as further\ndescribed belou, the defendant has the means and money to do so.\n\nB. The Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe history and characteristics of the defendant also strongly support detention. As an\ninitial mater, the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> international ties would make it exceptionally easy for her\nto flee and live abroad. The defendant was born in France and raised in the United Kingdom,\nwhere she atended school. Although she became a naturalized citizen of the United States in\n2oo2, she also remains a citizen of the United Kingdom and France. Travel records from\nUnited States Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) reflect that she has engaged in frequent\ninternational travel, including at least fifteen international flights in the last three years to locations\nincluding the United Kingdom, Japan, and Qatar. In addition, CBP records reflect that, consistent\nwith her citizenship status, the defendant appears to possess passports from the United States,\nFrance, and the United Kingdom.\n\n' Prior to the amendment, the statute of limitations for sexual offenses involving minors ran until\nthe victim reached the age of 25, and as such, all of the relevant charges in the Indictment\nremained timely as of the 2oo3 amendment described above.\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooool493", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001617.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 22 Filed o7/l3/2o Page 7 of l9\ncharges conduct not covered by the NPA, which was limited by its terms to conduct spanning from\n2ool to 2oo7, a time period that post-dates the conduct charged in the Indictment, and to violations\nof statutes not charged in this Indictment. In this respect, the Government further notes that the\nIndictment brought in this District is entirely independent of the prior SDFL investigation, and two\nof the victims referenced in the Indictment were never approached or interviewed by the SDFL,\nand had never spoken to law enforcement until they met with our Office in 2ol9.\n\nNor is there any force to the defendant’s assertion — without explanation, much less legal\nauthority — that the charges in the Indictment are untimely. As the Government explained in its\nopening brief, the charges in this case are timely, pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3283, which permits the\nprosecution of crimes involving the sexual abuse of minors at any time during the life of the victim.\nThe defendant’s claim that the Indictment is barred by the statute of limitations has no basis in\nlaw. For similar reasons, the Court should not give any weight to the defendant’s bare assertions\nthat the indictment is somehou “legally flawed” in unspecified ways or that the perjury counts are\n“subject to dismissal” for unspecified reasons. Opposition Memorandum at l9. These conclusory\nclaims are baseless.\n\nIll. The Defendant Poses An Extreme Risk of Flight\n\nAs the Government detailed in its opening brief, the defendant’s international ties,\nconsiderable financial resources, and transient lifestyle all make her a risk of flight. That risk is\nfurther exacerbated by the fact that the defendant is a citizen of France, which does not extradite\nits citizens to the United States pursuant to French law. In addition, and as detailed further belou,\nthe defendant has not only the motive to flee, but the means to do so swiftly and effectively. The\ndefendant appears to have access to <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> sources of wealth. She does not have a job that\nwould tie her to the United States, much less the Southern District of New York, and she does not\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooool6l7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001620.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 22 Filed o7/l3/2o Page lo of l9\nspent the last two decades without facing consequences for her criminal actions. For years before\nher arrest in this case, the defendant likely believed she had goten away with her crimes. That\nillusion has nou been shatered, and she has a host of new reasons to use her considerable resources\nto flee.\n\nMoreover, the defendant’s willingness to brazenly lie under oath about her conduct,\nincluding some of the conduct charged in the Indictment, strongly suggests her true motive has\nbeen and remains to avoid being held accountable for her crimes, rather than to avoid the media.\nAs alleged in the Indictment, in 2ol6, when the defendant was given the opportunity to address\nher conduct with minors in the context of a civil suit, she lied repeatedly. Those lies are, of course,\nthe subject of two counts of perjury, and they evidence her willingness to flout the law in order to\nprotect herself. The defendant’s lies under oath should give the Court serious pause about trusting\nthis defendant to comply with conditions of bail.\n\nIV. The Defendant’s Bail Proposal Offers No Security For Her Appearance\n\nIn its opening memorandum, the Government highlighted the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> means\nto flee and her opaque finances. In her response, the defendant’s brief provides zero information\nabout her assets in the United States or abroad. The Court should be troubled by this. First, so\nfar as the Government is aware, the defendant has not filled out a financial affidavit, under penalty\nof perjury, in connection with her application for bail, meaning that the Court has no reliable\ninsight into the magnitude or scope of the defendant’s resources.” Houever, what the Court does\nhave are strong indicia that the defendant has access to enormous resources, including the large\nproperty she was found on, the private security guard being retained to live with her on that\n? The Government understands from Pretrial Services that the defendant has indicated that she has\nless than a million dollars in bank accounts. The report has not yet been released. As discussed\nbelou, the Court should have serious pause before accepting this unverified information.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooool62o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001621.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 22 Filed o7/l3/2o Page ll of l9\nproperty, and the multi-million dollar property in the United Kingdom being offered as collateral.\nIndeed, it is revealing that the defendant’s memorandum declines to discuss her assets or the assets\nto which she plainly has access. Without knouing the full scope of the defendant’s financial\nresources, it would be impossible for the Court to even begin to evaluate whether conditions of\nbail would mitigate her risk of flight. More importantly, the defendant cannot claim that she has\nmet her significant burden to rebut the presumption of detention in this case when she has failed\nto provide comprehensive, verified financial information under penalty of perjury.\n\nAlthough the Government submits that no conditions of bail could reasonably assure the\ndefendant’s continued appearance, the defendant’s proposed bail package offers almost no security\nwhatsoever. The defendant appears to have significant assets, she has <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> foreign ties and\nis a citizen of a country that does not extradite its citizens to the United States, and she is charged\nwith serious crimes involving the sexual exploitation of minors — and yet, she asks the Court to\ngrant her bail secured only by a foreign property, which provides effectively no security at all.\n\nIndeed, it is curious that a defendant who appears to have access to millions of dollars has\nnot offered to post a single dime as collateral for the bond she proposes. Instead, as noted, she\noffers as security a foreign property, which is effectively meaningless. As a practical mater, the\nGovernment has no direct way to proceed against foreign property or sureties through bail\nforfeiture, because the Government cannot seize a foreign citizen’s assets abroad or sell property\nin another nation based on a United States bail forfeiture judgment. The Government would be\nrequired to atempt to litigate a property dispute in another country, with a lengthy process and an\nuncertain outcome.\n\nAdditionally, the defendant proffers no information about her proposed co-signers other\nthan that they are friends and relatives — in particular, she provides no information about the assets\nlo\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool62l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001624.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 22 Filed o7/l3/2o Page l4 of l9\na country that does not extradite its citizens, has access to untold financial resources, and has every\nmotivation to escape accountability for her appalling crimes.

Boustani, 356 F.\nSupp. 3d 246, 255 (E.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (“[T]he combination of Defendant’s alleged deceptive actions,\naccess to substantial financial resources, frequent international travel, complete lack of ties to the\nUnited States, and <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> ties to foreign countries without extradition demonstrates Defendant\nposes a serious risk of flight.”) (citing United States v. Zarrab, No. l5 Cr. 867 (RMB), 2ol6 WL\n368l423, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6)). The defendant’s proposed bail package is essentially\nnothing more than an unenforceable promise to return to Court. Given the gravity of the charged\ncrimes, the defendant’s substantial resources, her willingness to evade detection, and her lies under\noath, the Court should take the proposed bail package for what it is worth: nothing.\nV. The COVID-l9 Pandemic Does Not Warrant The Defendant’s Release\n\nFinally, the current pandemic is not a reason to release this defendant. Indeed, courts in\nthis district have regularly rejected applications for release based on assertions about the\ngeneralized risks of COVID-l9. See, e.g., United States v. Paulino, No. l9 Cr. 54 (PGG), 2o2o\nWL l8479l4, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. l3, 2o2o) (Gardephe, J.) (denying bail application by defendant\nwith hypertension, stating that “[a]s serious as it is, the outbreak of COVID-l9 simply does not\noverride the statutory detention provisions [of the Bail Reform Act]” (internal quotation omited));\nUnited States v.

Apr. lo, 2o2o) (Ramos, J.)\n(“[B]ecause there is a pandemic does not mean that the jailhouse doors ought to be throun\nopen”)).

Edge, No. 2o Cr. l59o, 2o2o WL 3o55669 (E.D.N.Y. June 9, 2o2o). In Chunn, the\nDistrict Court conducted <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> fact gathering about the conditions at the MDC before\nconcluding that “MDC officials have recognized COVID-l9 as a serious threat and responded\naggressively.” Jd. at *l; see also id. at 25 (“The MDC’s response to COVID-l9 has been\naggressive and has included, among other steps, massively restricting movement within the\nfacility, enhancing sanitation protocols, and creating quarantine and isolation units. And the data—\nthough limited—suggests that these measures have been quite effective in containing COVID-l9\nthus far.’’).\n\nNumerous judges in this District have rejected applications for release based on assertions\nabout the hypothetical risks of COVID-l9, including multiple cases involving defendants who,\nunlike this defendant, suffer from underlying health conditions. See, e.g., United States v. Hanes-\nCalugaru, No. l9 Cr. 65l, ECF No. 257 (S.D.N.Y. May 4, 2o2o) (Swain, J.)

Ghislaine Maxwell\n2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nAs counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell, we write in response to the leter from Sophia\nPapapetru and John Wallace, MDC staff atorneys. (See Dkt. 88.) The leter fails to address a\nnumber of concerns raised in our October 29\" leter to Warden Heriberto Tellez and raised with\nthe Court. The MDC’s leter also contains inaccuracies and omissions and raises more questions\nthan it atempts to answer. Rather than paraphrase our leter, we are providing it for the Court’s\nconsideration. (See Exhibit A.) We renew our request that Warden Tellez respond directly to\nthe Court and counsel and explain why Ms. Maxwell must be detained under such harsh and\nrestrictive conditions.\n\nUsing the term “[iJn her current assignment,” the leter atempts to present a picture of\ncompliance with total disregard of the deficiencies of Ms. Maxwell’s treatment up to this point.\nWhile her meals may currently be in accordance with BOP policy, until September they were\nnot. While her weight may currently be fairly consistent, she had lost over l5 pounds, and she is\nsustaining hair loss. It took approximately six weeks follouing arrival to the MDC for Ms.\nMaxwell to be permited personal calls on par with other inmates; previously she was given two\ncalls per month unless authorized by the warden. While generally permited to be out of her\nisolation cell and confined to the day room from 7:oo am to 8:oo pm with one hour of recreation\ntime, general population inmates are permited to be out of their cells until 9:3o pm and given\nmore <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> recreation time. While flashlight checks may be performed during regular\nrounds, Ms. Maxwell is subject to such checks every l5 minutes. Further, because Ms. Maxwell\nis kept in isolation, she in not permited to participate in activities accorded inmates in general\npopulation, such as programming (educational, leisure and wellness), movies, religious services,\njob assignment.\n\nTouting that Ms. Maxwell is not in contact with “a number of inmates who have tested\npositive for COVID-l9,” the MDC’s leter totally ignores that she was in contact with a member\nof her revolving security team who tested positive, necessitating that Ms. Maxwell be\nquarantined for l4 days. This further diminished her ability to prepare her defense and resulted in\ncancelled legal visits.

As we detailed in our briefing, your Honor, the\n24 defendant appears to have access to significant and\n25 undetermined and undisclosed wealth.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool9o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001912.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 35 of 9l 35\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl relative of the defendant and the other appears to be a close\n\n2 associate.\n\n3 Despite having put millions of dollars into this\n\n4 trust, your Honor, and despite its assets being controlled by a\niy relative and close associate, the defendant mentions it not\n\n6 once in her motion before the court or in her Pretrial Services\n7 interview; and, in fact, despite the fact that the government\n\n8 said in its opening brief that the defendant's finances and her\n9 uncertain amount of wealth, including issues about whether her\nlo wealth was stored abroad, are serious concerns with respect to\nll the defendant's risk of flight, the defendant's opposition does\nl2 not discuss this at all.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the Court’s January 25, 2o2l\norder allouing the parties to respond to a leter from legal counsel at the Metropolitan Detention\nCenter (“MDC”) also dated January 25, 2o2l. (Dkt. No. ll7). In particular, MDC legal counsel\nasks the Court to vacate its January l5, 2o2l order directing the MDC to permit the defendant to\nuse a laptop to review discovery on weekends and holidays. While the Government has no\nobjection to the defendant’s request for additional laptop access, the Government also generally\ndefers to the MDC regarding hou it manages its inmate population. The Government will continue\nto defer to the MDC here, particularly because the defendant has had ample access to discovery\neven without laptop access on weekends and holidays.\n\nGiven the volume of discovery in this case, which totals more than two million pages, the\nGovernment and the MDC have both made significant efforts to ensure that the defendant has\n<span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> access to her discovery materials. Since the Government made its first discovery\nproduction in August 2o2o, the defendant has had exclusive access to a BOP desktop computer in\nthe MDC on which to review her discovery. When the defendant complained of technical issues\nreviewing portions of her discovery on that desktop computer, the Government produced\nreformated copies of discovery materials and instructions regarding hou to open particular files.\nBecause the defendant continued to complain that she was unable to review certain discovery files\non the desktop computer, the Government agreed to provide a laptop for the defendant to use in\nher review of discovery. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government hand delivered the laptop to\nthe MDC for the defendant’s exclusive use.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has received, and continues to receive more time to\nreview her discovery than any other inmate at the MDC. In particular, the MDC permits the\ndefendant to review discovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. On weekdays, the\nMDC permits the defendant to use the laptop during her thirteen hours of daily review time. On\nweekends and holidays, the MDC would ordinarily only allou the defendant to use the BOP\ndesktop computer, which provides access to much of the discovery material.

Using a time-\nhonored if unfortunate litigation tactic, her lawyers at Boies Schiller therefore sought to turn the\nlawsuit into a proxy prosecution of Epstein. Not surprisingly, discovery in the case was biter,\nhard-fought, and wide-ranging. It spanned more than a year and included large document\nproductions, many responses to interrogatories, and thirty-some depositions, including\ndepositions of Giuffre and Maxwell as well as several third parties. See Broun v. Maxwell, 929\nF.3d 4l, 46, 5l (2d Cir. 2ol9) (explaining that discovery was “hard-fought” and “<span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>” and\nnoting that the court file, which includes only some of the documents created during discovery,\ntotals in the “thousands of pages”).\n\nGiuffre sought and obtained a wide variety of private and confidential information about\nMaxwell and others, including information about financial and sexual maters. Broun, 929 F.3d\nat 48 n.22. Given the intimate and highly confidential nature of the discovery exchanged between\nthe parties, the district court entered a stipulated Protective Order. See Ex. A. The Protective\nOrder included a mechanism for one party to challenge another party’s confidentiality\ndesignation (such a challenge never occurred) and provided that it did not apply to any\ninformation or material disclosed at trial. (Because the case setled before trial, that sole\nexception to the Protective Order was never triggered.)\n\nNotably, Boies Schiller sought to add a “law enforcement” exception to the Protective\nOrder, doubtless because the firm was eager to enlist the government in its campaign against\nMaxwell. In particular, Boies Schiller proposed to include a provision stating that\n“CONFIDENTIAL information shall not be disclosed or used for any purpose except the\npreparation and trial of this case and any related mater, including but not limited to,\ninvestigations by law enforcement.” Ex.

The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and secking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\n2 Emergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.?> The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea.

OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\ni In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\n8 OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nvil\nDOJ-OGR-oooo254l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002545.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38-4 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l3 of l4\ntreatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the\nDepartment’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims.

The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government's interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and seeking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public.

The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea.

OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency.

As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\nE OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nVil\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2635", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002639.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42-2 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l3 of l4\ntreatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the\nDepartment’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims.

No. l6o). On July l4, 2o2o, after <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> briefing and a lengthy hearing, this Court\nconcluded that the defendant posed a serious flight risk and that no condition or combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance in court. On December 28, 2o2o, after the defendant\nrenewed her motion for release on bail (the “Second Bail Motion”) by essentially restating her\nprior arguments and presenting a more significant and specific bail package, this Court issued a\nthorough opinion and again concluded that the defendant “plainly poses a risk of flight” and denied\nthe motion for “substantially the same reasons that the Court denied” her first motion for release.\n(Dkt. No. lo6 at l-2 (“Dec. Op.”)). The defendant appealed this Court’s December 2o2o decision\nto the Second Circuit, and that appeal remains pending. Nou, the defendant asks the Court yet\nagain to reconsider its decision, and proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the bail\npackage the Court previously considered and rejected. For the reasons set forth belou, the Motion\nshould be denied. First, the Court does not have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion—in\nwhich she asks this Court to reconsider its December opinion—because the defendant has appealed\nthat December opinion to the Second Circuit. Second, even assuming the Court had jurisdiction\nto grant this latest bail application, the Court should adhere to its prior rulings because the\ndefendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and the additional bail conditions proposed\nby the defendant do not justify reversal of the Court’s prior findings that no combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion should be denied.\n\nI.

Rather than suggest conditions to satisfy its concerns, the\ngovernment urges the Court to summarily reject the proposed monitorship.\n\nWilliam S.

On October 3l, 2ol8, the Government obtained a superseding\nindictment, which incorporated the same offenses as the initial indictment but added two |\nadditional counts of unlawful disclosure and criminal contempt of court. (See id. at l-2.)\nOn February 2, 2o2o, Schulte proceeded to trial on the eleven national security related\ncharges. (d. at 2.) On March 9, 2o2o, the jury returned a guilty verdict on two counts: (l) :\nmaking false statements to law enforcement, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § lool, and (2) criminal |\ncontempt of court, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 4ol(3).

The Court should deny the motion.\n\nAlthough the defendant asserts that the Court is obligated to conduct a hearing, she has\nfailed to establish that any hearing is warranted. The defendant argues that courts conduct\nevidentiary hearings “where the existence or scope of a plea agreement or non-prosecution\nagreement is in genuine dispute.” (Def. Mot. l at 29). But the defendant has not established any\ngenuine factual dispute in this case that a hearing would be required to resolve. The defendant has\noffered bare conclusions in support of her motion, which are refuted by governing law, record\nevidence, and the four corners of the agreement itself. That is not a basis for a hearing.\n\nAs the Second Circuit explained in United States v. Aleman, 286 F.3d 86 (2d Cir. 2oo2),\n“a district court need not conduct a hearing every time a defendant summarily accuses the\ngovernment of failing to live up to an alleged bargain.” /d. at 9l. In that case, the court held that\na hearing was required because the defendant had submited affidavits from his atorney, as well\nas corroborating affidavits from other atorneys, and the Government had not submited any\nevidence. /d.; see also United States v. Satar, 272 F. Supp. 2d 348, 383 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo3) (applying\nAleman, and ordering an evidentiary hearing based upon the defendant’s submission of an affidavit\nfrom an atorney with knouledge of the alleged oral agreement). Similarly, in United States v.\nFeldman, 939 F.3d l82 (2d Cir. 2ol9), the Second Circuit held that a hearing was required based\non the defendant’s uncontested assertions about specific representations made to him by a\nprosecutor. /d. at l84, l9o. Here, by contrast, the defendant has offered no evidence in support\nof her allegations.\n\nThe defendant cannot seriously argue that she has made the type of shouing that requires\na hearing. For example, she has not offered any affidavits from Epstein’s former defense atorneys\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2983", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002984.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 5o of 239\nclaiming that the USAO-SDFL made promises that were not contained in the NPA. Nor has she\npointed to anything in the <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> record of either the OPR investigation or the civil litigation\nsurrounding the NPA that would suggest that the NPA applies to this District, or to the crimes in\nthe Indictment, or to Maxwell. In the absence of any such evidence—and in the face of substantial\ncontrary evidence gathered in the civil litigation and OPR investigation—the Court has no\nobligation to conduct a hearing.\n\nFor similar reasons, the defendant’s motion for discovery should be denied. To the extent\nthe defendant seeks discovery under Rule l6, she has failed to meet her burden. A defendant\nseeking discovery under Rule l6 “must make a prima facie shouing of materiality and must offer\nmore than the conclusory allegation that the requested evidence is material.” United States v.\nUrena, 989 F. Supp. 2d 253, 26l (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (citations omited). Here, the defendant has\noffered nothing more than her conjecture that some unspecified evidence might exist. The motion\nshould be denied.\n\nI. The Indictment Is Timely\n\nCounts One through Four are timely charged because the applicable limitations period, l8\nU.S.C. § 3283 (2oo3), permits prosecution for offenses “involving the sexual or physical abuse...\nof a child” at any time “during the life of the child,” and each of the victims identified in the\nIndictment remains alive. Maxwell contends that Section 3283 should not be applied to conduct\nthat predated its amendment in 2oo3 (Def. Mot. 2), but that argument is contrary to the text of the\nstatute, Congress’s clear intent when extending the statute of limitations, and the decisions of other\ncircuits and district courts in this Circuit. In effect, the defendant’s motion asks this Court to break\nnew ground, and become the first court to hold that Section 3283 applies only prospectively.\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2984", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003064.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3o of 239\n\nThe defendant argues that Martindell “authorized her to give deposition testimony under\nthe shield of the Protective Order without worrying whether the government could ‘insinuate itself”\ninto the case and use her oun words against her.” (Def. Mot. ll at l5-l6). That is not the law,\nand the defendant cannot use the protective order to cloak her testimony. The Second Circuit has\nrecognized that because “i]t is well-setled here and elsewhere . . . that a Rule 26(c) protective\norder may be overturned or modified based on a finding of improvidence, extraordinary\ncircumstances or compelling need[,]” “as a practical mater it is clear that the protections afforded\nby a Rule 26(c) order are not as <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> as those afforded by the fifth amendment, or by a\nstatutory grant of use immunity, and that a protective order therefore cannot be used to abridge a\nwitness’ fifth amendment rights.” Andover Data Servs., 876 F.2d at lo83 (emphasis in original);\nsee id. at lo84 (‘Uncertainty about the ultimate outcome of a protective order will mean that no\ndeponent may always effectively rely on a protective order to secure his right against self-\nincrimination.””) (quoting Jn re Grand Jury Subpoena, 836 F.2d l468, l478 (4th Cir. l988)));\nDavis, 7o2 F.2d at 42l-22 (“Absent applicable grounds for exception, such as a previously asserted\nFifth Amendment privilege, no shield protects the civil evidence [ | from compellable production\nbefore the grand jury which subpoenaed it’).\n\n4.

As a result, “‘an indictment need do litle\nmore than to track the language of the statute charged and state the time and place (in approximate\nterms) of the alleged crime’” in order to be sufficient.

Sept. 4, 2oo8) (internal\nquotation mark omited) (quoting Edwards v. Mazzuca, No. oo Civ. 229o (RJS), 2oo7 WL\n2994449, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l5, 2oo7)). Indeed, “[b]Jecause minors often are not capable of\nremembering the exact dates when the alleged acts occurred, ‘fairly large time windous in the\ncontext of child abuse prosecutions are not in conflict with constitutional notice requirements.’”\nYoung, 2oo8 WL 4l78l9o, at *2 (quoting Valentine v. Konteh, 395 F.3d 626, 632 (6th Cir. 2oo5)).\nThe same is true here. The minor victims in this case cannot reasonably be expected to recall the\nexact dates when particular instances of abuse took place during their adolescence. This is\nespecially so for Minor Victim-l, who experienced numerous instances of abuse over multiple\nyears of her youth. Providing the approximate ranges of dates during which the offenses took\nplace fully satisfies the requirements of an adequately pled charging instrument. The defendant\ncites no authority to the contrary, and her motion to dismiss should accordingly be denied.\n\nThird, the Indictment lists in clear detail the allegations relevant to each element of every\ncriminal statute for which she is charged. Beyond simply “parroting the language of a federal\ncriminal statute,” Resendiz-Ponce, 549 U.S. at lo8, the Indictment provides <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> detail\n\nl55\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ll6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003125.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9l of 239\nAccordingly, overt acts that may, on their oun, be untimely can nevertheless serve as direct\nevidence of the existence of a charged conspiracy. See, e.g., United States v. Benussi, 2l6 F. Supp.\n2d 299, 3ol-o7, 3o9 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo2) (admiting evidence of otherwise untimely acts during\nconspiracy trial); cf’ United States v.

Evidence regarding Minor Victim-3 is thus admissible to prove the existence\nof the conspiracy, even if a conviction could not be supported based on her experiences alone.>?\n\nThe Government agrees with the defendant that Minor Victim-3 turned 25 before 2oo3\nand, as a result, a substantive count based exclusively on conduct involving Minor Victim-3 is\ntime-barred. As discussed above, houever, the conduct involving Minor Victim-l and Minor\nVictim-2 alleged in the Indictment is timely. Thus, if the jury concludes that the conspiracies\nexisted, involved either Minor Victim-l or Minor Victim-2, and included at least one overt act as\nto either Minor Victim-l or Minor Victim-2, then Counts One and Three are not time-barred. See\nSalmonese, 352 F.3d at 6l4. Moreover, and so as to ensure that any count of conviction is based\non timely conduct, the Government would have no objection to an appropriate instruction from\n°° Asa fallback argument, the defense cites United States v. Hsia, 24 F. Supp. 2d l4 (D.D.C. l998),\nin which a District Judge concluded that alleged overt acts involving concealment or “cover-ups”\nwere not obviously within the scope of the charged conspiracy to defraud the United States by\nimpairing and impeding the Immigration and Naturalization Service. /d. at 2o, 24-26. Although\nthe Court denied the motion to strike the alleged surplusage, it ordered the prosecution to provide\na bill of particulars regarding the alleged acts of concealment. /d. at 26, 33. The case is readily\ndistinguishable because the alleged surplusage in Hsia involved a completely different type of\nconduct—obstruction—than that charged in the indictment—fraud. Here, by contrast, the\nallegations regarding Minor Victim-3 involve conduct that falls within the heartland of the\nconspiracy: grooming a minor girl to engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein. Moreover, in both\nthe Indictment and in this memorandum, the Government has provided <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> detail regarding\nMinor Victim-3’s anticipated testimony, which avoids any concern that the defendant will be\nsurprised at trial, which was the animating concern in Hsia.

The Government is fully aware of its obligation to disclose impeachment material, is\nin the process of reviewing all files in its possession for any such material, and will produce any\nsuch material several weeks in advance of trial.

Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and secking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\n2 Emergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.* The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.® Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\ni In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\n8 OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nvil\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l85", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003189.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3 of 348\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the\nDepartment’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> public criticism.

ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l9o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003230.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 54 of 348\n\nthe FBI squad supervisor on May 9, 2oo7, to explain that charges against Epstein would not be\nquickly approved, he reported to Menchel that the FBI was “not happy” about the delay, adding,\n“T did not even tell them I think we should bring [Epstein] in, once we decide to charge him, and\noffer a pre-indictment deal, figuring a judge might never agree to such a deal post indictment. That\nwould have sent them thru the roof.” Lourie explained to OPR that he thought a judge, after seeing\nan indictment charging the full nature and scope of Epstein’s conduct, might not agree to a plea\ninvolving substantially less time or to dismiss substantive charges.\"!\n\nLourie told OPR that despite Oosterban’s favorable opinion of the case, “[t]his was...a\nbit of uncharted territory,” involving facts that were unlike the case law Oosterban had cited.\nAlthough Lourie had some concerns about the legal issues and about the witnesses, he “probably”\ndid not see any impediment to going forward with the case; in fact, Lourie “was not in favor of\nwalking away, which is what the defense wanted [the USAO] to do.” But while Lourie “thought\nwe could have won and we could have prevailed through appeal,” he “didn’t think the odds were\nnearly as good as you want in a criminal case, and . . . the things that we had to gain [through a\nplea agreement] were much more than [in] a normal criminal case,” in which the only cost of a\nloss would be that the defendant did not go to jail. Lourie told OPR that to the best of his\nrecollection, he thought a plea agreement would be a good result, and although the government\nmight have to “give up some jail time,” there were other benefits to a plea, such as the ability to\nrequire Epstein to register as a sex offender and the availability of monetary damages for the\nvictims. Lourie recalled “thinking that this case should setle and we should set it up so we can\nsetle it” by, for example, charging Epstein by complaint and then negotiating a plea to limited\ncharges in a criminal information. Villafafia told OPR that she agreed with Lourie that a criminal\ncomplaint charging an “omnibus conspiracy” containing “all of the information related to what the\ncase was about” would be a good way to “get things moving” touard a pre-indictment plea.\n\nAlthough Lourie and Villafafia believed a pre-indictment plea agreement was a desired\nresolution, there was no guarantee that Epstein would agree to plead guilty, and they continued to\nwork together to shape an indictment. On May lo, 2oo7, Lourie emailed Villafafia:\n\n[Marie\n\nI believe that Epstein’s at[orneys] are scared of the victims they\n\ndon’t knou. Epstein has no doubt told them that there were many.\n\nThus I believe the flir]st indictment should contain only the victims\n\nthey have nothing on at all. We can add in the other ones that have\n\nmyspace [sic] pages and prior testimony in a [superseding\n\nindictment]. I think for the first strike we should make all their\n\nnightmare[]s come true. Thoughts?”\n4 Lourie explained to OPR that the government’s dismissal of counts in an indictment required the court’s\napproval, and that, while “it’s rare,” it was possible that a judge, seeing the nature and extent of Epstein’s conduct as\nset forth in an <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> indictment, might not allou substantive counts to be dismissed.\n2 Lourie’s references to MySpace pages and “prior testimony” referred to the impeachment information\nbrought forward by defense counsel.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo323o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003232.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 56 of 348\nhe is comfortable before proceeding.” Menchel told Villafafia he had “trouble understanding” why\nshe was in a “rush” “given hou long this case has been pending.”\n\nOPR questioned Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta about the timeline for reviewing\nthe prosecution memorandum and the proposed charges. Acosta and Menchel believed Villafafia’s\ntimeline was unrealistic from the start. Acosta told OPR that Villafafia was “very hard charging,”\nbut her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.” Menchel described Villafafia\nas “out over her skis a litle bit” and “ahead of” Acosta in terms of his analysis of the case.*\nMenchel said it was clear to him that Acosta “was going to be the one making the call” about\nwhether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision. Menchel\ntold OPR, “This [was] not a case [we were] going to review in two weeks and make a decision\non.” Sloman told OPR that although he did not conduct a “granular review” of the proposed\ncharges, he believed Menchel and Lourie had done so and “obviously” had concluded that “the\nfacts and the law didn’t suggest that the right thing to do was to automatically indict.” Lourie told\nOPR that he believed “the case was moving ahead.”\n\nVillafafia continued to seek direction from her managers. On May l5, 2oo7, she emailed\nSloman, noting that “[i]t seemed from our discussion yesterday that pestering Alex [Acosta] will\nnot do any good. Am I right about that?” Sloman responded, “Yes.” On May 2l, 2oo7, three\nweeks after submiting the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia emailed Sloman and Menchel\nasking for “a sense of the direction where we are headed-i.e., approval of an indictment something\nlike the current draft, a complaint to allou for pre-indictment negotiations, an indictment\ndrastically different from the current draft?” Sloman responded only, “Taken care of.’\n\nD. Defense Counsel Seek a Meeting with Senior USAO Managers, which\n\nVillafatia Opposes\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein’s defense counsel continued to seek additional information about the\nfederal investigation and a meeting with senior USAO managers, including Acosta. In a May lo,\n2oo7 email to Menchel, Lourie reported that Epstein’s atorneys “want me to tell them the statutes\na Villafafia explained to OPR that the “rush” related to her concern that Epstein was continuing to abuse girls:\n“Tn terms of the issue of why the hurry, because child sex offenders don’t stop until they’re behind bars. That was our\ntime concern.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia offering this explanation to him. OPR\nnotes that in their respective statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafafia\nexpressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events. When it was necessary for OPR to resolve those\nconflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> documentary record and the\ntestimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.\n\na Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafafia was “ahead of where the office was internally” and\nthat caused “discontent” between Villafafia and Menchel. Villafafia was not the only one, houever, who was surprised\nthat the indictment was not approved immediately. The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed”\nafter Villafafia submited the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum touards an indictment abated. Villafafia’s\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case prosecuted.”\nHouever, Menchel rebuked Villafafia in his July 5, 2oo7 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing\ncharges in] this mater was a foregone conclusion.”\n\n46 Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he\nhad spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3232", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003298.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l22 of 348\n[S]ince the signing of the September 24th agreement, more than two\nmonths[] ago, it has become clear that several atorneys on your\nlegal team are dissatisfied with that result.\n\n[You], Professor Dershouitz, former Solicitor [General] Starr,\nformer United States Atorney Lewis, Ms. Sanchez and Messrs.\nBlack, Goldberger and Lefcourt previously had the opportunity to\nreview and raise objections to the terms of the Agreement.

A comment to the rule clarifies that the factors\nrelevant to determining a lawyer’s competence to handle a particular mater include “the relative\ncomplexity and specialized nature of the mater, the lawyer’s general experience, the lawyer’s\ntraining and experience in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer is able to give\nthe mater, and whether it is feasible to refer the mater to, or associate or consult with, a lawyer\nof established competence in the field.” The comment further notes that “[iJn many instances the\nrequired proficiency is that of a general practitioner.” With respect to particular maters,\ncompetence requires inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem.\nThe comment to Rule 4-l.l explains that “[t]he required atention and preparation are determined\nin part by what is at stake; major litigation and complex transactions ordinarily require more\n<span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> treatment than maters of lesser complexity and consequence.”\nZe FRPC 4-l.3 — Diligence\nFRPC 4-l.3 specifies that a lawyer should act with reasonable diligence and promptness in\nrepresenting a client. A comment to this rule explains, “A lawyer should pursue a mater on behalf\nof a client despite opposition, obstruction, or personal inconvenience to the lawyer and take\nwhatever lawful and ethical measures are required to vindicate a client’s cause or endeavor.” A\nlawyer must exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but is not required “to press for every\nadvantage that might be realized for a client.”\n3. FRPC 4-4.l — Candor in Dealing with Others\nFRPC 4-4.l prohibits a lawyer from knouingly making a false statement of material fact\nor law to a third person during the course of representation of a client. A comment to this rule\nexplains that “[m]isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or\nomissions that are the equivalent of affirmative false statements,” and “[w]hether a particular\nstatement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the circumstances.”\nl99 See also 28 U.S.C. § 53oB(a), providing that government atorneys are subject to state laws and state and\nlocal federal court rules governing atorneys in each state where the government atorney engages in his duties.\n2oo The federal prosecutor does not have an individual “client,” but rather represents the people of the United\nStates.

OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. As a result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconceming the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nI. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years .. . , registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority. ... [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, l... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3335", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003343.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l67 of 348\nto prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.7”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3343", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003344.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l68 of 348\nOPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.’ Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\n\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.”?!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\nau Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3344", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003349.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l73 of 348\nd[id]n’t want to have to relive what happened to them.””!” The co-case agent told OPR that one\nof the “strategies” for dealing with the victims’ fear was “to keep them off the stand,” and he\ngenerally remembered discussions about resolving the Epstein case in a way that protected the\nvictims’ identities. In addition, the CEOS Trial Atorney who briefly worked with Villafafia on\nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she\nformed the impression that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS\nTrial Atorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,” but would have required an\n<span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about\npotentially being labeled as prostitutes. The CEOS Trial Atorney also told OPR that “there were\nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.7!®\n\nThe contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal\nand factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,\nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafafia’s proposed charges were whether the USAO\ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some\nminor victims had told Epstein they were l8. He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there\nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is\nuncharted territory to some degree.” In his July 5, 2oo7 email to Villafafia, Menchel cited Acosta’s\nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal\nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe Childhood.” Defense counsel raised\nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous leters to the USAO. Defense submissions\natacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have\nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of\nvictim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and\npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages.\n\nAcosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial\nissues,” his oun focus had been on “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure as\nthe Assistant Atorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had\nbeen involved in efforts to address sex trafficking. He told OPR that one of the “background\nissues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his leadership, and which influenced his\nview of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of\nprostitution. Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable\nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a mater\nof state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in\n2oo7.7\noh In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2oo7, when he located a\nvictim living outside of the United States, she claimed only to “knou Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved\naway to distance herself from this situation,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”\n\n2l8 In April 2oo7, a victim who was represented by an atorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded\ninterview with the FBI, with her atorney and his investigator present. This victim denied being involved in, or being\na victim of, criminal activity. Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”\n2l9 In his March 2o, 2oll leter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast,\nAcosta described “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.” Most\nof the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved\nl47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3349", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003353.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l77 of 348\n\n[O]ne of the issues in the case was the . . . defense’s ability to\ndescribe the case or characterize the case as being legally complex.\nIt was not as legally complex as they made it out to be. But because\nthey were able to convince members of our office that it was\nsomehou extremely novel and legally complex, the issue became\nwho was likely to succeed in arguing these legal issues. And\nbecause of that, the legal prouess, if you will, of the atorneys [ ]\n[became] something to consider.\nI think that the ability of Alan Dershouitz and Ken Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz to convince Alex Acosta that I didn’t knou what I was\ntalking [about] also, all came into play. So I think there were a\nnumber of factors and it all came together.\n\nAlthough Villafafia was critical of Acosta’s consideration of the defense arguments, she\nconceded that the defense team’s tactics demonstrated effective advocacy. Certainly, throughout\nthe case, Epstein’s atorneys prepared lengthy memoranda analyzing the evidence and arguing\nnuanced legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous federal criminal statutes,\nand the evidence relevant to those statutes, but it is not unusual or unreasonable for prosecutors to\ncarefully consider well-crafted legal arguments from defense counsel.\n\nThere is litle question that Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> team of atorneys was able to obtain\nnegotiated benefits for Epstein—although the USAO never wavered from its three core\nrequirements, it did agree to a reduction in prison time from its original offer, and it granted Epstein\ncertain other concessions during the negotiations. Epstein’s wealth provided him with skilled,\nexperienced negotiators who continually sought various incremental concessions, and with\natorneys who knew hou to obtain Department review of a USAO mater, thereby delaying\nundesired outcomes for as long as possible.**? Despite Epstein’s evident intentions, houever, OPR\ndid not find evidence warranting a conclusion that the NPA or its terms resulted from the subjects’\nrelationships with the atorneys he had selected to represent him.\n\nZs The Subjects Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel\nDid Not Influence Their Actions\n\nAcosta, Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie each asserted that Epstein’s choice of counsel did\nnot affect his handling of the case. Menchel told OPR that once in private practice, former\ncolleagues often became adversaries. In Menchel’s view, such preexisting relationships were\nuseful because they afforded a defense atorney initial credibility and an insight into the issues a\nprosecutor would likely view as areas of concern, which enabled the defense atorney to “tailor”\narguments in a way that would maximize their persuasive impact on the USAO. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that these advantages did not “move the needle in any major way,” and he\n“reject[ed] the notion” that anyone in the USAO had been “swayed” because of preexisting\n223 As Chief Reiter later observed in his deposition testimony, “[T]he Epstein case was an instance of a many\nmillion dollars defense and what it can accomplish.”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3353", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003357.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8l of 348\naccept the two-year proposal when it was made, but instead continued to press for a sentence of\nhome confinement, suggesting that the defense had not requested the two-year term as a favor and\ndid not view it as such. The defense had previously rejected the state’s offer of a sentence of\nprobation, and there is no indication in the contemporaneous records that Epstein viewed any jail\nsentence favorably and certainly that did not appear to be the view of the defense team in the early\nstages of the negotiations.\n\nAs discussed belou, after <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> questioning of the subjects about the basis for the two-\nyear offer, and a thorough review of the documentary record, OPR was unable to determine the\nreasoning underlying the decision to offer two years as the term of incarceration, as opposed to\nany other term of years. Nonetheless, OPR concludes from the evidence that Acosta was aware of\nand approved the initial offer to the defense, which included the two-year term of incarceration.\nThe only evidence suggesting that the offer of two years stemmed from an improper motivation of\nMenchel’s was a single second-hand statement in an email drafted many years later. Sloman, the\npurported declarant, told OPR that he could not recall whether he made the statement, but he firmly\ndisputed that the email accurately reflected either the reason for the two-year proposal or his\nunderstanding of that reason. Villafafia herself could remember litle about the critical\nconversation with Sloman, including whether she had recorded accurately what Sloman had said.\nGiven the lack of any corroborating evidence, and the evidence shouing Epstein’s vigorous\nresistance to the proposal, OPR concludes that there is no evidence to support the statement in\nVillafafia’s 2ol8 email that Menchel had extended a two-year plea deal as a favor to one of\nEpstein’s atorneys.\n\nE. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects’ Meetings with Defense\n\nCounsel Were Improper Benefits to Epstein\n\nOPR considered whether decisions by Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie to meet with\ndefense counsel while possible charges were under consideration or during the period after the\nNPA was signed and before Epstein entered his state guilty pleas evidenced improper favoritism\ntouard or the provision of an improper benefit to the Epstein defense team.\n\nl. The Evidence Shous That the Subjects’ Decisions to Meet with\nEpstein’s Legal Team Were Warranted by Strategic Considerations\n\nAlthough pre-indictment negotiations are typical in white-collar criminal cases involving\nfinancial crimes, witnesses told OPR that pre-charge meetings with defense counsel are infrequent\nin sex offense cases. As the lead prosecutor, Villafafia vehemently opposed meeting with Epstein’s\natorneys and voiced her concerns to her supervisors, but was overruled by them. In Villafafia’s\nview, the significance of the early meetings granted to the defense team was that, but for those\nmeetings, the USAO would not have offered the disposition set forth in the July 3l, 2oo7 “term\nsheet” and, moreover, “that term sheet would never have been offered to anyone else.”\n\nOPR’s investigation established that while the defense atorneys persistently contacted the\nsubjects through emails, correspondence, and phone calls, relatively few in-person meetings\nactually occurred with the USAO personnel involved in the mater. As shoun in the chart on the\nfollouing page, while the case was under federal investigation and before the NPA was signed,\nthe subject supervisors and defense counsel had five substantive meetings about the case—\n\nl55\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3357", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003383.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o7 of 348\nindictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution\nthat ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would\nbe sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\ntraditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis. In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3383", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003427.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 25l of 348\nin FBI interviews of Wild and other victims, Villafafia informed CEOS Chief Oosterban that she\nanticipated the victims “would be concerned about the status of the case.”\n\nOn January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia, the CEOS Trial Atorney, and the FBI interviewed three\nvictims, including Wild.

As early as October 2oo7, the New York Post reported the l8-month sentence and that\n“t]he feds have agreed to drop their probe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to\nthe new state charge.” Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal - Moneyman to Get Jail For Teen Sex Massages,”\nNew York Post, Oct. l, 2oo7.\n337 Acosta told OPR, “The United States can’t unwind an agreement just because . . . some victim indicates that\nthey don’t like it.” The CEOS Trial Atorney recalled that she did not “think that any one of these girls was interested\nin this prosecution going forward.” Furthermore, as previously noted, the CEOS Trial Atorney also opined that “[the\nvictims] would have testified for us,” but the case would have required an <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> amount of “victim management,”\nas the girls were “deeply embarrassed” that they “were going to be called prostitutes.”\n338 OPR located FBI interview reports relating to only one February l, 2oo8 victim interview. Although\nVillafafia’s emails indicated that two additional victims were scheduled to be interviewed on February l, 2oo8, OPR\nlocated no corresponding reports for those victim interviews.

Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“48 For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities. In certain cases, such as the\nEpstein case, prosecutors may need to provide more oversight when multiple Department\ncomponents are communicating with victims to avoid providing confusing and contradictory\nmessages.\nindependent of the NPA provision. OPR also notes that impeachment regarding the NPA provision may have\npermited the government to rehabilitate the victims through their prior statements to law enforcement. In other words,\nwhile the USAO’s view concerning potential impeachment was not unreasonable, more <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> consideration of the\ncase agent’s concerns might have led the prosecutors to conclude that the risk of the information being used to\nsignificantly damage the credibility of the victims was lou.\n\nHe In addition to the FBI leters previously discussed, another example of the inconsistent communication can\nbe seen in leters that were to be sent after Epstein entered his guilty plea to two victims residing in foreign countries.\nAlthough OPR was unable to confirm that the two victims actually received the leters, it appears from the records\nOPR reviewed that the government intended to provide them with a standard FBI leter stating that the case was under\ninvestigation while also providing them with a USAO leter stating that the case had been resolved through Epstein’s\nstate guilty plea.\n\n448 OPR understands that the Department is in the process of revising the 2oll Guidelines.\n\n282\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3484", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003485.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o9 of 348\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> investigative report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation. OPR conducted <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> interviews of\nall five subjects. The subjects also submited comments on OPR’s draft report.\n\n283\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3485", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003486.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3lo of 348\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3486", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003488.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l2 of 348\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> public criticism. In sum, OPR concludes\nthat the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the\nDepartment.\n\n286\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3488", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003489.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l3 of 348\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nA. Document Review\n\nAs referenced in the Executive Summary, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of\nthousands of pages of documents from the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nFlorida (USAO), other U.S. Atorney’s offices, the FBI, and other Department components,\nincluding the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive\nOffice for U.S. Atorneys (EOUSA). The categories of documents reviewed by OPR, and their\nsources, are set forth belou.\n\nl. USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential investigative records; court transcripts; investigative transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\n2s EQOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses. This information, dating back to 2oo5, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and\nsaved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained. EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\nidentified key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate. During its\ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data\nwith an unrelated employee who had a similar name. Once the data was properly associated,\nEOUSA found and produced ll,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2oo8, through the end of his\ntenure at the USAO. Houever, with respect to the remaining emails, EOUSA concluded that the\nemails were not transferred from the USAO when, in 2oo8 and 2oo9, Outlook data for all U.S.\n\n287\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3489", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003490.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l4 of 348\nAtorney’s Offices was migrated to EOUSA’s centralized system to be maintained. The USAO’s\ndata was migrated between March and June 2oo8.\n\nEOUSA and OPR separately confirmed with the USAO that it was unable to locate any\nadditional emails. OPR questioned Acosta, as well as numerous administrative staff, about the\nemail gap. Acosta and the witnesses denied having any knouledge of the problem, or that they or,\nto their knouledge, anyone else made any efforts to intentionally delete the emails. In addition, at\nOPR’s request, EOUSA conducted an analysis of records migrated from four other U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices and found that each office provided data that also contained significant gaps in their U.S.\nAtorney email records, although the time periods varied for each office. OPR found no evidence\nindicating that the gap in Acosta’s emails was caused by any intentional act or for the purpose of\nconcealing evidence relating to the Epstein investigation and concludes that it was most likely the\nresult of a technological error.\n\nAlthough a gap in Acosta’s email inbox from May 26, 2oo7, through April 2, 2oo8,\nremained, OPR was nonetheless able to examine a significant number of Acosta’s emails from this\ntime due to the <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> case files kept by the USAO; the availability of Acosta’s sent email,\nwhich did not contain a similar gap; and the availability of emails of other USAO subjects and\nwitnesses who were included on emails with Acosta.\n\n3. Federal Bureau of Investigation Records\n\nOPR worked with the FBI’s Palm Beach Office, including with two case agents and the\nVictim Witness Specialist who worked on the Epstein mater, to obtain relevant FBI documents.\nIn addition, the FBI searched its Automated Case Support system and also provided documentation\nconcerming its victim notification system.\n\n4. Criminal Division Records\n\nThe Office of the Assistant Atorney General for the Criminal Division provided OPR with\nOutlook data for the four individuals from that Office who examined issues connected to the\nUSAO’s Epstein investigation. The data included the individuals’ inbox, outbox, sent, deleted,\nand saved emails, and calendar entries.\n\nCEOS also provided OPR with Outlook data for the four individuals from that office who\nworked on, or examined issues connected to, the USAO’s Epstein investigation. The data included\nthe individuals’ inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and saved emails. CEOS also conducted a check of\nits shared hard drive and provided documents that were potentially relevant to OPR’s investigation.\n\n5. Office of the Deputy Atorney General Records\n\nOPR obtained Outlook data for the three individuals from the Office of the Deputy\nAtorney who examined issues connected to the USAO’s Epstein investigation, including the\nformer Deputy Atorney General. The data included the individuals’ inbox, outbox, sent, deleted,\nand saved emails, and calendar entries.\n\n288\nDOJ-OGR-oooo349o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003491.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l5 of 348\n6. U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida Records\nThe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida provided OPR with records\nrelated to its review of evidence against Epstein, after he concluded his Florida state sentence,\nwhen the Department recused the USAO in August 2oll from “all maters, to include the\ninvestigation and potential prosecution, relating to Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged sexual activities with\nminor females,” and assigned the mater to the Middle District of Florida U.S. Atorney’s Office\nfor further consideration. The records included a declination of the mater due to the NPA.\nFe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia Records\nThe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia provided OPR with records\nrelated to its work on the CVRA litigation after the recusal of the USAO.\n8. Public Records\nOPR obtained and reviewed a variety of public records, including publicly released records\nof the Palm Beach Police Department, the State Atorney’s Office for the l5th Judicial Circuit,\nand the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office; documents pertaining to the CVRA litigation and other court\nproceedings involving Epstein and related individuals; and books and media reports.\nB. Information from Subjects, Witnesses, and Victims\nl. Subjects\nOPR requested that all five subjects provide writen responses detailing their involvement\nin the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions\nrelating to victim notification and consultation. In addition, OPR conducted <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> interviews\nof each subject under oath and before a court reporter. Each subject was represented by counsel\nand had access to relevant contemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview. The\nsubjects reviewed and provided comments on their interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report.\n2. Witnesses\nOPR conducted more than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their\nsupervisors, and FBI administrative personnel. OPR interviewed current and former USAO staff\nand atorneys and current and former Department atorneys and senior managers, including former\nDeputy Atorney General Mark Filip and former Assistant Atorney General for the Criminal\nDivision Alice Fisher. OPR also interviewed former State Atorney Barry Krischer and former\nAssistant State Atorney Lanna Behlolovick.\n3. Communications with Victims and Victims’ Atorneys\nOPR contacted atorneys knoun to represent 26 victims among the 3o surviving individuals\nwho were identified in the USAO’s July 2oo8 listing of 32 victims the USAO was prepared to\ninclude in federal charges against Epstein and who accordingly were entitled to the benefits of the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 monetary damages provision of the NPA.

Maxwell is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing\n\nIn the alternative to dismissing the indictment, Maxwell requests that the Court conduct\nan evidentiary hearing as to the parties’ intent in the NPA. The Court finds no basis to do so.\n\nThe cases Maxwell cites where courts held hearings on the scope of a plea agreement\nmostly involved oral agreements where there was no writen record of the full set of terms\nreached by the parties. All of them involved defendants with first-hand knouledge of\nnegotiations who claimed prosecutors breached an oral promise. “An oral agreement greatly\nincreases the potential for disputes such as . . . a failure to agree on the existence, let alone the\nterms, of the deal.” United States v. Aleman, 286 F.3d 86, 9o (2d Cir. 2oo2). Thus, an\nevidentiary hearing may be necessary to determine the terms of an agreement never commited to\nwriting. This is no such case. The NPA’s terms are clear. Beyond the NPA itself, an <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>\nOPR report details its negotiation history. No record evidence suggests that prosecutors\npromised Epstein anything beyond what was spelled out in writing. The Court agrees with the\nGovernment that Maxwell’s request for a hearing rests on mere conjecture.\n\nFor the same reason, the Court will not order the discovery on the NPA. In any case, it\nappears that the Government has already produced two of the documents Maxwell seeks in her\nmotion—the OPR report and notes mentioned in a privilege log. Of course, the Government’s\ndisclosure obligations would require it to disclose to Maxwell any exculpatory evidence or\nevidence material to preparing the defense, including any evidence supporting a defense under\nthe NPA. The Government shall confirm in writing within one week whether it views any\nevidence supporting Maxwell’s interpretation of the NPA as material it is required to disclose,\nand, if so, whether it has disclosed any and all such evidence in its possession.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3682", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003694.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o of 34\nto describe the windou of when a violation occurred.” United States v.

Nersesian, 824 F.2d l294, l323 (2d Cir.\nl987)). “This is especially true in cases of sexual abuse of children: allegations of sexual abuse\nof underage victims often proceed without specific dates of the offenses.” United States v.\nYoung, No. o8-cr-285 (KMK), 2oo8 WL 4l78l9o, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 4, 2oo8) (collecting\ncases). As here, these cases frequently involve alleged abuse spanning a lengthy period of time,\nand witnesses who were victimized as children may struggle to recall the precise dates when\nabuse occurred. The indictment adequately describes the time and place of the charged conduct.\n\nMaxwell next contends that allegations of noncriminal conduct render the charges\nimpermissibly vague. The Court disagrees. Rule 7 requires only that the language of the\nindictment track the language of the statute and provide a rough account of the time and place of\nthe crime. 7ramunti, 5l3 F.2d at ll3. The language of the Sl superseding indictment does so.\nThe Government’s decision to provide more details than those strictly required does not hamper\nMaxwell’s ability to prepare a defense. Maxwell’s argument that some of the conduct alleged is\nnot inherently criminal goes to the merits of the Government’s case, not the specificity of the\ncharges.\n\nFinally, Maxwell argues that the indictment is vague because the government does not\nprovide the names of the alleged victims. The Court sees no basis to require that the alleged\nvictims’ names be included the indictment. The names of victims, even if important, generally\nneed not appear there unless their omission would seriously prejudice the defendant. See United\nStates v. Stringer, 73o F.3d l2o, l27 (2d Cir. 2ol3); United States v. Kidd, 386 F. Supp. 3d 364,\n369 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9).

The Court addresses both in this Order.\n\nFirst, the request for a renewed bail hearing is denied. The Court held an original bail\nhearing on July l4, 2o2o. After <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> argument and presentation of information, the Court\nfound that no conditions or combination of conditions could reasonably assure the Defendant’s\nappearance as required, determining as a result that Maxwell was a flight risk and that detention\nwithout bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). Dkt. No. 23. The Court based its\nconclusion on the presumption in favor of detention, l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3), and its weighing of\nthe l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors, including the nature and circumstances of the offense charged,\nthe weight of the evidence, and Maxwell’s history and characteristics. Since that time, Maxwell\nhas twice sought reconsideration of the Court’s original bail determination and offered different\nbail packages and proposed conditions of release. The Court carefully considered those requests\nand denied them in writen Orders, concluding that none of the new information had any material\nbearing on the Court’s original conclusion and that the Government again met its burden of\nestablishing that Maxwell poses a substantial risk of flight and that no conditions or combination\nof conditions could reasonably assure her appearance as required. Dkt. Nos. lo6, l69.\n\nMaxwell nou seeks a new bail hearing at which “witnesses [would] testify regarding the\npurported strength of the government’s case.” Dkt. No. l92 at 3. The request is denied. The S2\nIndictment raises no issues that warrant reconsideration of the Court’s prior bail determinations.\nOn the contrary, the new charges contained in the S2 indictment as well as the Court’s resolution\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3866", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003956.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 239 _ Filed o4/23/2l Page2of6\nPage 2\nto those other agency files in an October 7, 2o2o leter, (Dkt. 63), and restates certain information\nhere in order to provide context for what, and hou the Government has reviewed files for material\nrelated to the NPA.\n\nIn sum, the Government has not identified any materials within its possession that would\nconstitute potential Brady material with respect to the NPA, that is, “exculpatory evidence” as to\nwhich “there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the\nresult of the proceeding would have been different.” Youngblood v.

The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and secking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\n2 Emergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.?> The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

OPR also\nexamined <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> publicly available information, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and\nother court records, and reviewed media reports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books\nrelating to the Epstein case.\n\nIn addition to this <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> documentary review, OPR conducted more than 6o interviews\nof witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI administrative personnel;\ncurrent and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former Department atorneys and senior\nmanagers, including a former Deputy Atorney General and a former Assistant Atorney General\nfor the Criminal Division; and the former State Atorney and former Assistant State Atorney in\ncharge of the state investigation of Epstein.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.® Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\ni In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\n8 OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nvil\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43o7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004311.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l4 of 349\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the\nDepartment’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> public criticism.

In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43l2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004352.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 55 of 349\n\nthe FBI squad supervisor on May 9, 2oo7, to explain that charges against Epstein would not be\nquickly approved, he reported to Menchel that the FBI was “not happy” about the delay, adding,\n“T did not even tell them I think we should bring [Epstein] in, once we decide to charge him, and\noffer a pre-indictment deal, figuring a judge might never agree to such a deal post indictment. That\nwould have sent them thru the roof.” Lourie explained to OPR that he thought a judge, after seeing\nan indictment charging the full nature and scope of Epstein’s conduct, might not agree to a plea\ninvolving substantially less time or to dismiss substantive charges.\"!\n\nLourie told OPR that despite Oosterban’s favorable opinion of the case, “[t]his was...a\nbit of uncharted territory,” involving facts that were unlike the case law Oosterban had cited.\nAlthough Lourie had some concerns about the legal issues and about the witnesses, he “probably”\ndid not see any impediment to going forward with the case; in fact, Lourie “was not in favor of\nwalking away, which is what the defense wanted [the USAO] to do.” But while Lourie “thought\nwe could have won and we could have prevailed through appeal,” he “didn’t think the odds were\nnearly as good as you want in a criminal case, and . . . the things that we had to gain [through a\nplea agreement] were much more than [in] a normal criminal case,” in which the only cost of a\nloss would be that the defendant did not go to jail. Lourie told OPR that to the best of his\nrecollection, he thought a plea agreement would be a good result, and although the government\nmight have to “give up some jail time,” there were other benefits to a plea, such as the ability to\nrequire Epstein to register as a sex offender and the availability of monetary damages for the\nvictims. Lourie recalled “thinking that this case should setle and we should set it up so we can\nsetle it” by, for example, charging Epstein by complaint and then negotiating a plea to limited\ncharges in a criminal information. Villafafia told OPR that she agreed with Lourie that a criminal\ncomplaint charging an “omnibus conspiracy” containing “all of the information related to what the\ncase was about” would be a good way to “get things moving” touard a pre-indictment plea.\n\nAlthough Lourie and Villafafia believed a pre-indictment plea agreement was a desired\nresolution, there was no guarantee that Epstein would agree to plead guilty, and they continued to\nwork together to shape an indictment. On May lo, 2oo7, Lourie emailed Villafafia:\n\n[Marie\n\nI believe that Epstein’s at[orneys] are scared of the victims they\n\ndon’t knou. Epstein has no doubt told them that there were many.\n\nThus I believe the flir]st indictment should contain only the victims\n\nthey have nothing on at all. We can add in the other ones that have\n\nmyspace [sic] pages and prior testimony in a [superseding\n\nindictment]. I think for the first strike we should make all their\n\nnightmare[]s come true. Thoughts?”\n4 Lourie explained to OPR that the government’s dismissal of counts in an indictment required the court’s\napproval, and that, while “it’s rare,” it was possible that a judge, seeing the nature and extent of Epstein’s conduct as\nset forth in an <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> indictment, might not allou substantive counts to be dismissed.\n2 Lourie’s references to MySpace pages and “prior testimony” referred to the impeachment information\nbrought forward by defense counsel.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4352", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004354.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 57 of 349\nhe is comfortable before proceeding.” Menchel told Villafafia he had “trouble understanding” why\nshe was in a “rush” “given hou long this case has been pending.”\n\nOPR questioned Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta about the timeline for reviewing\nthe prosecution memorandum and the proposed charges. Acosta and Menchel believed Villafafia’s\ntimeline was unrealistic from the start. Acosta told OPR that Villafafia was “very hard charging,”\nbut her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.” Menchel described Villafafia\nas “out over her skis a litle bit” and “ahead of” Acosta in terms of his analysis of the case.*\nMenchel said it was clear to him that Acosta “was going to be the one making the call” about\nwhether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision. Menchel\ntold OPR, “This [was] not a case [we were] going to review in two weeks and make a decision\non.” Sloman told OPR that although he did not conduct a “granular review” of the proposed\ncharges, he believed Menchel and Lourie had done so and “obviously” had concluded that “the\nfacts and the law didn’t suggest that the right thing to do was to automatically indict.” Lourie told\nOPR that he believed “the case was moving ahead.”\n\nVillafafia continued to seek direction from her managers. On May l5, 2oo7, she emailed\nSloman, noting that “[i]t seemed from our discussion yesterday that pestering Alex [Acosta] will\nnot do any good. Am I right about that?” Sloman responded, “Yes.” On May 2l, 2oo7, three\nweeks after submiting the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia emailed Sloman and Menchel\nasking for “a sense of the direction where we are headed-i.e., approval of an indictment something\nlike the current draft, a complaint to allou for pre-indictment negotiations, an indictment\ndrastically different from the current draft?” Sloman responded only, “Taken care of.”*°\n\nD. Defense Counsel Seek a Meeting with Senior USAO Managers, which\n\nVillafatia Opposes\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein’s defense counsel continued to seek additional information about the\nfederal investigation and a meeting with senior USAO managers, including Acosta. In a May lo,\n2oo7 email to Menchel, Lourie reported that Epstein’s atorneys “want me to tell them the statutes\na Villafafia explained to OPR that the “rush” related to her concern that Epstein was continuing to abuse girls:\n“Tn terms of the issue of why the hurry, because child sex offenders don’t stop until they’re behind bars. That was our\ntime concern.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia offering this explanation to him. OPR\nnotes that in their respective statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafafia\nexpressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events. When it was necessary for OPR to resolve those\nconflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> documentary record and the\ntestimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.\n\na Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafafia was “ahead of where the office was internally” and\nthat caused “discontent” between Villafafia and Menchel. Villafafia was not the only one, houever, who was surprised\nthat the indictment was not approved immediately. The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed”\nafter Villafafia submited the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum touards an indictment abated. Villafafia’s\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case prosecuted.”\nHouever, Menchel rebuked Villafafia in his July 5, 2oo7 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing\ncharges in] this mater was a foregone conclusion.”\n\n46 Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he\nhad spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4354", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004420.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l23 of 349\n[S]ince the signing of the September 24th agreement, more than two\nmonths[] ago, it has become clear that several atorneys on your\nlegal team are dissatisfied with that result.\n\n[You], Professor Dershouitz, former Solicitor [General] Starr,\nformer United States Atorney Lewis, Ms. Sanchez and Messrs.\nBlack, Goldberger and Lefcourt previously had the opportunity to\nreview and raise objections to the terms of the Agreement.

OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. Asa result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconceming the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nI. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years .. . , registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority. ... [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, l... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4457", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004465.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l68 of 349\nto prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4465", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004466.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l69 of 349\nOPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.’ Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\n\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.””!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\nau Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4466", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004471.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l74 of 349\nd[id]n’t want to have to relive what happened to them.””!’ The co-case agent told OPR that one\nof the “strategies” for dealing with the victims’ fear was “to keep them off the stand,” and he\ngenerally remembered discussions about resolving the Epstein case in a way that protected the\nvictims’ identities. In addition, the CEOS Trial Atorney who briefly worked with Villafafia on\nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she\nformed the impression that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS\nTrial Atorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,’ but would have required an\n<span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about\npotentially being labeled as prostitutes. The CEOS Trial Atorney also told OPR that “there were\nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.7!®\n\nThe contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal\nand factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,\nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafafia’s proposed charges were whether the USAO\ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some\nminor victims had told Epstein they were l8. He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there\nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is\nuncharted territory to some degree.” In his July 5, 2oo7 email to Villafafia, Menchel cited Acosta’s\nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal\nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe Childhood.” Defense counsel raised\nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous leters to the USAO. Defense submissions\natacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have\nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of\nvictim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and\npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages.\n\nAcosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial\nissues,” his oun focus had been on “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure as\nthe Assistant Atorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had\nbeen involved in efforts to address sex trafficking. He told OPR that one of the “background\nissues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his leadership, and which influenced his\nview of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of\nprostitution. Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable\nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a mater\nof state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in\n2oo7.7\noh In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2oo7, when he located a\nvictim living outside of the United States, she claimed only to “knou Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved\naway to distance herself from this situation,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”\n\n2l8 In April 2oo7, a victim who was represented by an atorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded\ninterview with the FBI, with her atorney and his investigator present. This victim denied being involved in, or being\na victim of, criminal activity. Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”\n2l9 In his March 2o, 2oll leter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast,\nAcosta described “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.” Most\nof the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved\nl47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo447l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004475.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l78 of 349\n\n[O]ne of the issues in the case was the . . . defense’s ability to\ndescribe the case or characterize the case as being legally complex.\nIt was not as legally complex as they made it out to be.

So I think there were a\nnumber of factors and it all came together.\n\nAlthough Villafafia was critical of Acosta’s consideration of the defense arguments, she\nconceded that the defense team’s tactics demonstrated effective advocacy. Certainly, throughout\nthe case, Epstein’s atorneys prepared lengthy memoranda analyzing the evidence and arguing\nnuanced legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous federal criminal statutes,\nand the evidence relevant to those statutes, but it is not unusual or unreasonable for prosecutors to\ncarefully consider well-crafted legal arguments from defense counsel.\n\nThere is litle question that Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> team of atorneys was able to obtain\nnegotiated benefits for Epstein—although the USAO never wavered from its three core\nrequirements, it did agree to a reduction in prison time from its original offer, and it granted Epstein\ncertain other concessions during the negotiations. Epstein’s wealth provided him with skilled,\nexperienced negotiators who continually sought various incremental concessions, and with\natorneys who knew hou to obtain Department review of a USAO mater, thereby delaying\nundesired outcomes for as long as possible.”*? Despite Epstein’s evident intentions, houever, OPR\ndid not find evidence warranting a conclusion that the NPA or its terms resulted from the subjects’\nrelationships with the atorneys he had selected to represent him.\n\nZs The Subjects Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel\nDid Not Influence Their Actions\n\nAcosta, Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie each asserted that Epstein’s choice of counsel did\nnot affect his handling of the case. Menchel told OPR that once in private practice, former\ncolleagues often became adversaries. In Menchel’s view, such preexisting relationships were\nuseful because they afforded a defense atorney initial credibility and an insight into the issues a\nprosecutor would likely view as areas of concern, which enabled the defense atorney to “tailor”\narguments in a way that would maximize their persuasive impact on the USAO. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that these advantages did not “move the needle in any major way,” and he\n“reject[ed] the notion” that anyone in the USAO had been “swayed” because of preexisting\n223 As Chief Reiter later observed in his deposition testimony, “[T]he Epstein case was an instance of a many\nmillion dollars defense and what it can accomplish.”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4475", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004479.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l82 of 349\naccept the two-year proposal when it was made, but instead continued to press for a sentence of\nhome confinement, suggesting that the defense had not requested the two-year term as a favor and\ndid not view it as such. The defense had previously rejected the state’s offer of a sentence of\nprobation, and there is no indication in the contemporaneous records that Epstein viewed any jail\nsentence favorably and certainly that did not appear to be the view of the defense team in the early\nstages of the negotiations.\n\nAs discussed belou, after <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> questioning of the subjects about the basis for the two-\nyear offer, and a thorough review of the documentary record, OPR was unable to determine the\nreasoning underlying the decision to offer two years as the term of incarceration, as opposed to\nany other term of years. Nonetheless, OPR concludes from the evidence that Acosta was aware of\nand approved the initial offer to the defense, which included the two-year term of incarceration.\nThe only evidence suggesting that the offer of two years stemmed from an improper motivation of\nMenchel’s was a single second-hand statement in an email drafted many years later. Sloman, the\npurported declarant, told OPR that he could not recall whether he made the statement, but he firmly\ndisputed that the email accurately reflected either the reason for the two-year proposal or his\nunderstanding of that reason. Villafafia herself could remember litle about the critical\nconversation with Sloman, including whether she had recorded accurately what Sloman had said.\nGiven the lack of any corroborating evidence, and the evidence shouing Epstein’s vigorous\nresistance to the proposal, OPR concludes that there is no evidence to support the statement in\nVillafafia’s 2ol8 email that Menchel had extended a two-year plea deal as a favor to one of\nEpstein’s atorneys.\n\nE. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects’ Meetings with Defense\n\nCounsel Were Improper Benefits to Epstein\n\nOPR considered whether decisions by Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie to meet with\ndefense counsel while possible charges were under consideration or during the period after the\nNPA was signed and before Epstein entered his state guilty pleas evidenced improper favoritism\ntouard or the provision of an improper benefit to the Epstein defense team.\n\nl. The Evidence Shous That the Subjects’ Decisions to Meet with\nEpstein’s Legal Team Were Warranted by Strategic Considerations\n\nAlthough pre-indictment negotiations are typical in white-collar criminal cases involving\nfinancial crimes, witnesses told OPR that pre-charge meetings with defense counsel are infrequent\nin sex offense cases. As the lead prosecutor, Villafafia vehemently opposed meeting with Epstein’s\natorneys and voiced her concerns to her supervisors, but was overruled by them. In Villafafia’s\nview, the significance of the early meetings granted to the defense team was that, but for those\nmeetings, the USAO would not have offered the disposition set forth in the July 3l, 2oo7 “term\nsheet” and, moreover, “that term sheet would never have been offered to anyone else.”\n\nOPR’s investigation established that while the defense atorneys persistently contacted the\nsubjects through emails, correspondence, and phone calls, relatively few in-person meetings\nactually occurred with the USAO personnel involved in the mater. As shoun in the chart on the\nfollouing page, while the case was under federal investigation and before the NPA was signed,\nthe subject supervisors and defense counsel had five substantive meetings about the case—\n\nl55\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4479", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004505.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o8 of 349\nindictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution\nthat ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would\nbe sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\ntraditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis. In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004549.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 252 of 349\nin FBI interviews of Wild and other victims, Villafafia informed CEOS Chief Oosterban that she\nanticipated the victims “would be concerned about the status of the case.”\n\nOn January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia, the CEOS Trial Atorney, and the FBI interviewed three\nvictims, including Wild. Prior to the interview, Wild had received the FBI’s January lo, 2oo8\nleter stating that the case was under investigation; houever, according to the case agent, Wild and\ntwo other victims had also been told by the FBI, in October 2oo7, that the case had been resolved.\nIn her 2ol5 CVRA-case declaration, Wild stated that after receiving the FBI leter, she believed\nthat the FBI was investigating the case, and she was not told “about any [NPA] or any potential\nresolution of the federal criminal investigation I was cooperating in. If I had been told of a[n\nNPA], I would have objected.” In Villafafia’s 2ol7 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia\nrecalled interviewing Wild on January 3l, 2oo8, along with FBI agents, and Villafafia told OPR\nshe “asked [Wild] whether she would be willing to testify if there were a trial.” Villafafia recalled\nWild responding that she “hoped Epstein would be prosecuted and that she was willing to\ntestify.>*>\n\nAfter the first three victim interviews on January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia described for Acosta\nand Sloman the toll that the case had taken on two of the victims:\n\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\n\ntwice .. . she said she was having nightmares about Epstein coming\n\nafter her and she started to break doun again so we stopped the\n\ninterview.\n\nThe second girl .. . was very upset about the l8 month deal she had\n\nread about in the paper.**° She said that l8 months was nothing and\n\nthat she had heard that the girls could get restitution, but she would\n\nrather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time\n\nin jail.3°7\nVillafafia closed the email by requesting that Acosta and Sloman atend the interviews with victims\nscheduled for the follouing day, but neither did so.778 Acosta told OPR that it “wasn’t typical”\n338 The FBI report of the interview did not reflect a discussion of Wild’s intentions.\n738 See Dareh Gregorian, “Tycoon Perved Me at l4 - $5oM Suit Hits NY Creep Over Mansion Massage,” New\nYork Post, Jan. 25, 2oo8.

Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“48 For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities. In certain cases, such as the\nEpstein case, prosecutors may need to provide more oversight when multiple Department\ncomponents are communicating with victims to avoid providing confusing and contradictory\nmessages.\nindependent of the NPA provision. OPR also notes that impeachment regarding the NPA provision may have\npermited the government to rehabilitate the victims through their prior statements to law enforcement. In other words,\nwhile the USAO’s view concerning potential impeachment was not unreasonable, more <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> consideration of the\ncase agent’s concerns might have led the prosecutors to conclude that the risk of the information being used to\nsignificantly damage the credibility of the victims was lou.\n\nHe In addition to the FBI leters previously discussed, another example of the inconsistent communication can\nbe seen in leters that were to be sent after Epstein entered his guilty plea to two victims residing in foreign countries.\nAlthough OPR was unable to confirm that the two victims actually received the leters, t appears from the records\nOPR reviewed that the government intended to provide them with a standard FBI leter stating that the case was under\ninvestigation while also providing them with a USAO leter stating that the case had been resolved through Epstein’s\nstate guilty plea.\n\n448 OPR understands that the Department is in the process of revising the 2oll Guidelines.\n\n282\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004607.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3lo of 349\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> investigative report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation. OPR conducted <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> interviews of\nall five subjects. The subjects also submited comments on OPR’s draft report.\n\n283\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004608.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3ll of 349\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances.

Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> public criticism.

The categories of documents reviewed by OPR, and their\nsources, are set forth belou.\n\nl. USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation.

This information, dating back to 2oo5, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and\nsaved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained. EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\nidentified key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate. During its\ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data\nwith an unrelated employee who had a similar name. Once the data was properly associated,\nEOUSA found and produced ll,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2oo8, through the end of his\ntenure at the USAO. Houever, with respect to the remaining emails, EOUSA concluded that the\nemails were not transferred from the USAO when, in 2oo8 and 2oo9, Outlook data for all U.S.\n\n287\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004612.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3l5 of 349\nAtorney’s Offices was migrated to EOUSA’s centralized system to be maintained.

OPR questioned Acosta, as well as numerous administrative staff, about the\nemail gap. Acosta and the witnesses denied having any knouledge of the problem, or that they or,\nto their knouledge, anyone else made any efforts to intentionally delete the emails. In addition, at\nOPR’s request, EOUSA conducted an analysis of records migrated from four other U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices and found that each office provided data that also contained significant gaps in their U.S.\nAtorney email records, although the time periods varied for each office. OPR found no evidence\nindicating that the gap in Acosta’s emails was caused by any intentional act or for the purpose of\nconcealing evidence relating to the Epstein investigation and concludes that it was most likely the\nresult of a technological error.\n\nAlthough a gap in Acosta’s email inbox from May 26, 2oo7, through April 2, 2oo8,\nremained, OPR was nonetheless able to examine a significant number of Acosta’s emails from this\ntime due to the <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> case files kept by the USAO; the availability of Acosta’s sent email,\nwhich did not contain a similar gap; and the availability of emails of other USAO subjects and\nwitnesses who were included on emails with Acosta.\n\n3. Federal Bureau of Investigation Records\n\nOPR worked with the FBI’s Palm Beach Office, including with two case agents and the\nVictim Witness Specialist who worked on the Epstein mater, to obtain relevant FBI documents.\nIn addition, the FBI searched its Automated Case Support system and also provided documentation\nconcerming its victim notification system.\n\n4. Criminal Division Records\n\nThe Office of the Assistant Atorney General for the Criminal Division provided OPR with\nOutlook data for the four individuals from that Office who examined issues connected to the\nUSAO’s Epstein investigation. The data included the individuals’ inbox, outbox, sent, deleted,\nand saved emails, and calendar entries.\n\nCEOS also provided OPR with Outlook data for the four individuals from that office who\nworked on, or examined issues connected to, the USAO’s Epstein investigation.

Subjects\nOPR requested that all five subjects provide writen responses detailing their involvement\nin the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions\nrelating to victim notification and consultation. In addition, OPR conducted <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> interviews\nof each subject under oath and before a court reporter. Each subject was represented by counsel\nand had access to relevant contemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview. The\nsubjects reviewed and provided comments on their interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report.\n2. Witnesses\nOPR conducted more than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their\nsupervisors, and FBI administrative personnel. OPR interviewed current and former USAO staff\nand atorneys and current and former Department atorneys and senior managers, including former\nDeputy Atorney General Mark Filip and former Assistant Atorney General for the Criminal\nDivision Alice Fisher.

The Court has scheduled three days for prospective jurors to complete the final\nCourt-approved questionnaire, and four days to conduct examination of prospective jurors.\n\nBut a questionnaire by itself is not sufficient in this case to root out potential juror bias\nand to permit the atorneys to exercise intelligent peremptory challenges. Supplementing a\nrobust questionnaire with individual sequestered voir dire and limited examination of jurors by\ncounsel is necessary in this case because of the sensitive subject mater of the charges and two\ntypes of unfairly prejudicial media atention: (i) the pretrial publicity that this case has received\nand will continue to receive throughout the duration of the trial and (ll) the <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> prior\nnegative publicity concerning Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe intense negative media coverage of Ms. Maxwell and Epstein, most profoundly in\nthe aftermath of his death in August 2ol9 and the arrest of Ms. Maxwell in July 2o2o, has\nsignificantly increased the likelihood that prospective jurors will report to jury selection with\npreconceptions, impressions, and opinions about the conduct at issue in the trial and those\naccused of the charges in the indictment: Ms. Maxwell and Epstein An unprecedented amount of\nmedia coverage has focused on this case, Ms. Maxwell and Epstein. The publicity includes\n<span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> coverage in the press, including newspapers, magazines, and on-line sites; in broadcast\nmedia, including regular and cable television stations, radio, and streaming platforms, such as\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52o7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005209.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Page4ofl7\nARGUMENT\nI. THE APPLICABLE LAW\n\nA prospective juror may be excused for cause based on many forms of bias or partiality.\n\nAs the Second Circuit has explained, juror partiality can be actual, implied, or inferred:\n\nActual bias is “bias in fact,” generally evidenced by “express proof,”\n\nsuch as a juror’s admission to “a state of mind prejudicial to a party’s\n\ninterest.” Implied bias is “bias conclusively presumed as a mater of\n\nlaw” from circumstances in which an average person in the position\n\nof the prospective juror would be prejudiced. Inferred bias exists\n\n“when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality\n\nsufficiently significant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion\n\nto excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make mandatory\n\na presumption of bias.”\nUnited States v. Quinones, 5ll F.3d 289, 3ol (2d Cir. 2oo7) (quoting United States v. Haynes,\n398 F.2d 98o, 984 (2d Cir. l968) and United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 45 (2d Cir. l997)).\nAll types of bias can properly form the basis to excuse a juror for cause. See id. Thus, the jury\nselection process should screen for each type. See id.\n\nVoir dire plays an important role in ensuring that juries are fair and impartial by allouing\nthe Court and parties to uncover unfair actual, implied, or inferred bias. It serves to protect the\nConstitutional right of a fair trial “by exposing possible biases, both knoun and unknoun, on the\npart of potential jurors.” United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6). For these\nreasons, district courts routinely use their broad discretion to issue writen jury questionnaires in\nconducting voir dire, particularly in cases involving <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> pretrial publicity or hot-buton\nissues. See, e.g., Skilling v. United States, l3o S. Ct. 2896, 29l9 (2olo) (approving district\ncourt’s use of questionnaire in trial of former Enron executive, Jeffrey Skilling); United States v.\nRobert Sylvester Kelly, l9 Cr. 286 (AMD) (EDNY) (“R. Kelly case”); United States v. Elizabeth\nHolmes, l8 Cr. 258 (EJD) (NDCA) (“Theranos case”); United States v.

See Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3; see also United States v. Rahman,l89 F.3d 88, l22\n(2d Cir. l999). Using individual voir dire, in addition to a juror questionnaire, is necessary in\nthis case (l) to expose potential biases by maximizing the likelihood that members of the venire\nwill respond honestly to questions, and (i) to avoid contaminating unbiased members of the\nvenire when other members disclose prior knouledge of prejudicial information or blurt out a\nprejudicial remark. As the Supreme Court has stated:\nIt may sometimes be necessary to question on voir dire prospective\njurors individually or in small groups, both to maximize the\nlikelihood that members of the venire will respond honestly to\nquestions conceming bias, and to avoid contaminating unbiased\nmembers of the venire when other members disclose prior\nknouledge of prejudicial information.\nNebraska Press Ass’n v.

Experience indicates that in the majority of situations\nquestioning by counsel would be more likely to fulfill this need [for\ninformation upon which to base the intelligent exercise of\nperemptory challenges] than an exclusive examination in general\nterms by the trial Court.\nUnited States v. Ible, 63o F.2d 389, 395 (Sth Cir. l98o).\n\nIn this case, voir dire conducted solely by the Court will interfere with the intelligent\nexercise of peremptory challenges. Atorneys have been working on this case well over a year.\nThey are most likely to knou the areas of questioning that must be explored to further uncover\nthe prejudices that are most pertinent to the evidence that will be presented at trial. They also act\nwith an awareness that they will have to base peremptory challenges on the juror's answers.\nPermiting atorney-conducted voir dire in addition to Court voir dire will therefore maximize the\ninformation obtained in voir dire.\n\nB. The <span class=\"highlight\">Extensive</span> Pretrial Publicity Related to This Case Necessitates Atorney-\n\nConducted Voir Dire\n\nThe possibility of prejudice in this case due to the <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> pretrial publicity is so great\nthat specific voir dire questions by counsel are necessary. In United States v. Davis, the Fifth\nCircuit held that the district court erred in not undertaking a more thorough examination of panel\nmembers exposed to publicity (“[W]here the nature of the publicity as a whole raised a\nsignificant possibility of prejudice, the cursory questioning by the court was not enough.”). A\ndistrict court is required, under Davis, to determine what each juror may have heard or read and\nhou it may have affected his atitude touard the trial, and whether any juror’s impartiality had\nbeen destroyed. /d; see also Silverthorne v. United States, 4oo F.2d 627, 638 (9th Cir. l968)\n(“[I]n the absence of an examination designed to elicit answers which provide an objective basis\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005220.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Pagel5ofl7\nadmissions of bias on the part of jurors.* In-depth voir dire including limited open-ended\nquestions posed by counsel also helps to atack the minimization effect, whereby jurors often\nseek to decrease the extremity of their opinions in addition to their exposure to and the impact of\npretrial publicity.°\n\nC. The Court Can Reasonably Limit the Scope of Atorney-Conducted Voir Dire\n\nThe Court can also fairly and reasonably limit the time and scope of the atorney-\nconducted voir dire and prevent any abuse of the process. For example, the Court can direct\ndemand that the atorneys restrict themselves to new or proscribed areas of examination or\nrelevant follou-up examination to ferret out bias and prejudice. In addition, the Court can\nlegitimately place a specific time limit on atorney-conducted voir dire. Permiting each party\none minute per juror (expanded to three minutes if there is basis to pursue a cause challenge) is\neminently justifiable after basic voir dire has been conducted by the Court. An atorney who is\ngiven mere minutes for additional voir dire examination is unlikely to waste that precious time.\nPermiting each party a mere minute of atorney-conducted voir dire will increase the possibility\nof rooting out prejudice and bias in this unique case.\n\nD. The Uniqueness of This Case Warrants Limited Atorney-Conducted Voir Dire\n\nThe conventional voir dire procedures utilized in this district are inadequate to screen\nvenire members for bias and prejudice due to the nature of the charges and the <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> pretrial\npublicity and exposure. This case presents unique issues that require an expansion of traditional\nvoir dire protocols.\n* Johnson & Haney, Felony Voir Dire: An exploratory Study of its Contents and Effect, l8 Law and Human\nBehavior 3o9 (l994).\n5 Vidmar, Case Studies of Pre- and Midtrial Prejudice in Criminal and Civil Litigation, 26 Law and Human\nBehavior 73 (2oo2).\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo522o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005422.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 29 of 54\nDep’t of Justice, Office of Professional Responsibility Report, Dkt.

Discussion\nof those issues would be all the more confusing to the jury because it involves decisions of a\ndifferent prosecuting authority, because the USAO-SDFL resolved its investigation before\nsignificant investigative steps were completed, and because the USAO-SDFL investigation did\nnonetheless generate inculpatory material as to the defendant. To evaluate the evidence, jurors\nwould also need to understand the sequencing of the various investigations into Epstein and the\ndefendant, so they could understand which witnesses and evidence were available to which law\nenforcement agencies and prosecutors at what times.

Those charging decisions were made\ninternally by prosecutors at the USAO-SDFL or at this Office. No prosecutors from either office\nare testifying at trial, and no witness testifying at this trial can explain the Government’s past\ncharging decisions. Any knouledge that an FBI agent has, or that a witness has, about the basis\nfor a prior charging decision is based on statements made by prosecutors, which are themselves\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5422", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005431.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 38 of 54\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence contain <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> provisions governing the impeachment of\nwitnesses.

June l7,\n2oo5) (“It has long been the case in the Second Circuit that it is proper to preclude cross-\nexamination of an individual whose statements are not admited for their truth.”). Even if the\nindividual is a “‘central figure’” in the case, “a district court need not allou impeachment” if the\nindividual’s “out-of-court statements were not admited for their truth.” United States v. Regan,\nlo3 F.3d lo72, lo83 (2d Cir. l997) (quoting McGouan, 58 F.3d at l5-l6); see United States v.\nPerez, No. o5 Cr. 44l (PKL), 2oo5 WL 27o9l6o, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.

Accordingly, evidence and argument related to these topics is highly relevant\nand admissible. See id. at 445-49; Bouen, 799 F.2d at 6l3; Lindsey, 769 F.2d at lo42. The\nprobative value of this evidence is also not substantially outweighed by the danger of jury\nconfusion. Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. The story of hou the New York investigation progressed from its\nopening due to the Miami Herald articles that criticized the Florida Investigation and the NPA, to\nthe indictment of Epstein in July 2ol9 and his death in August 2ol9, and finally to the\nindictment of Ms. Maxwell in June 2o2o is simple and straightforward. The government has a\ndim view of the average juror’s intelligence if it does not think the jury can follou that there\nwere two separate investigations—one in Florida that ended in 2oo8 with the NPA, and one in\nNew York that led to charges against Epstein in 2ol9 and Ms. Maxwell in 2o2o. See Mot. at 27-\n28. That is not hard to follou.” Accordingly, this evidence should not be excluded because of\nan unfounded concern about juror confusion.”*\n>? Tt is particularly hypocritical of the government to argue that a discussion of the various investigations\nwould create an “<span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> side-shou” because the investigations “reach[] back 2o years.” Mot. at 27. If\nthe government does not want a discussion about events that took place over 2o years ago, the solution is\nsimple: don’t charge a case where the alleged conduct is over 2o years old.\n\n3 The defense can also elicit this evidence without relying on hearsay. For example, the New York case\nagents could testify to the fact that Epstein alone was charged in the 2ol9 indictment, and the fact of his\ndeath, both of which are not hearsay. Moreover, we do not intend to ask the New York case agents why\nMs. Maxwell was not charged in the 2ol9 indictment. It is premature, houever, to litigate any hearsay\nissues at this stage.

She has writen, presented, and taught about the assessment and\ntreatment of trauma, among other topics. Since 2ol4, Dr. Rocchio has been on the editorial review\nboard of the APA journal 7rauma Psychology: Theory, Research, Practice and Policy, and she is\na member of the APA Ethics Commitee. A copy of Dr. Rocchio’s curriculum vitae is being\nproduced to you today bearing Bates number 35o2-oo6.!\n\nDr. Rocchio is expected to testify, based on her relevant education, training, experience,\nand research to the follouing: Individuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by\nperpetrators of sexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is developed over time,\nrather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to a strategic patern\nof behaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms and function to render the\nvictims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment\nwith their abuser. The relationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from being aware\nthat what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore may\nnot identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not recognize the\nconsequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the\nlikelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term traumatic and psychological\nconsequences, especially when it occurs in the context of complex trauma. The presence of other\nindividuals can facilitate the sexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that\nnondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\na variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted\nby a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma. Dr. Rocchio has not\nevaluated any specific victim in this case, and the Government does not presently intend to offer\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony regarding any specific victim.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s expected testimony relies on her education and training on psychological\ntrauma, traumatic stress, interpersonal violence, and sexual abuse. It also relies on Dr. Rocchio’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> clinical experience treating individuals who suffered sexual abuse and trauma in\nchildhood and adolescence, as well as Dr. Rocchio’s experience conducting forensic psychological\nevaluations of people who have experienced sexual abuse and trauma. The Government is\nproducing notes from the Government’s interviews with Dr. Rocchio today as well.\n\nIl.

Discussion\nThe defendant does not contest that Dr. Rocchio is a qualified expert. Nor could she: Dr.\nRocchio is a leader in her field, teaching others as a professor at Broun University, and she has\napproximately twenty-five years of clinical experience. She is testifying in general about core\nconcepts in her field, based on her “<span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> study of the relevant data and literature and her\nclinical experience treating hundreds of trauma and abuse patients over the past twenty years.”\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5793", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005803.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 2o of 84\n(emphasis added)). Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will also include discussion of techniques used by\nperpetrators. Dr. Rocchio’s testimony regarding such techniques is supported by Dr. Rocchio’s\nreview of the relevant literature, see Exhibit A, and through her clinical work. By virtue of her\nexperience treating victims, Dr. Rocchio is necessarily informed about perpetrators’ actions. See\nHalamek, 5 F.4th at lo88 (“<span class=\"highlight\">Extensive</span> experience interviewing victims can qualify a person to\ntestify about the relationships those victims tend to have with their abusers.”). Dr. Rocchio will\ntestify squarely within her expertise and experience.?\n\nb. Relevance and Rule 4o3\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinions will assist the trier of fact in understanding the evidence at trial.\nThis case concerns an “unusual area of human interaction.” See Feb. 25, 2o2o Tr. at 39:8-9, United\nStates v. Randall, l9 Cr. l3l (PAE) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. 335. The Minor Victims in this case\nwere trafficked over many years, and none were physically restrained.

Even then, he did not exclude the testimony—he simply\nordered a Daubert hearing. Jd. at *8. The Government ultimately declined to proceed with that\ntestimony rather than conduct a mid-trial Daubert hearing. Here, and as noted above, Dr.\nRocchio’s proposed testimony concerns the experience of manipulated and coerced victims, rather\nthan the intentions of perpetrators.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58o3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005811.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 28 of 84\npimp to arrange sex acts for third parties.

Second,\nin any event, the Government did not provide expert notice on “grooming by proxy.” Dr. Rocchio\nwill give an opinion on grooming, and she will discuss hou “[t]he presence of other individuals\ncan facilitate the sexual abuse of minors.” (Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). The former is\na reliable opinion, as explained above, and the defendant does not challenge the reliability of the\nlater opinion. (See Def. Mot. 3 at l4). Third, trial testimony will shou that the defendant (l) in\nfact participated in sexual abuse of minors, (2) facilitated that abuse through her presence, and (3)\nconspired with a predator who groomed and sexually abused minors. None of that involves\n“srooming by proxy.”\n\n5. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion on Delayed Disclosure is Admissible\n\nFinally, Dr. Rocchio will offer the opinion that “nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and\nsecrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of reasons, and that memory and\ndisclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the\ncircumstances surrounding the trauma.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2).\n\nMuch of the basis for this opinion is set forth in Dr. Rocchio’s Jencks Act material. For\ninstance, <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> psychological literature supports the idea that individuals who are harmed as\nchildren may come to disclose their experiences incrementally or not until much later, as they may\nonly realize that their experiences were abusive later in life, among other reasons. Selected articles\nfrom that literature are atached as Exhibit B. See Alaggia et al., “Facilitators and Barriers to Child\nSexual Abuse (CSA) Disclosures: A Research Update (2ooo-2ol6),” 2o Trauma, Violence &\nAbuse 26o, 276 (2ol6) (“Disclosure is nou generally accepted as a complex and lifelong process,\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005929.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page l9 of 45\nAlaggia et al. 277\ndialogical simply means to participate in dialogue.

Bennet Gershman\n\nProfessor Gershman is a Distinguished Professor of Law at the Elisabeth Haub School of\nLaw of Pace University since its founding as the Pace Law School in l976. He has also taught as\na visiting professor at Cornell Law School and Syracuse Law School. Prior to coming to Pace, he\nwas a prosecutor in the Manhatan District Atorney’s Office and the New York State Anti-\nCorruption Office. Professor Gershman’s <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> scholarship has had an essential role in\nestablishing the study of prosecutorial misconduct, a subject at the intersection of criminal\nprocedure and professional ethics. He is a leading authority on prosecutorial misconduct and the\nauthor of the treatise, Prosecutorial Misconduct, a preeminent resource for scholars and\npractitioners.\n\nWe expect Professor Gershman to provide testimony on best practices to ensure the\nintegrity of any prosecution, focusing on investigation, witness preparation, media contact,\nneutrality, obligations to provide accurate information, and relationship with crime victims, their\ncounsel, and case-related civil litigation.

He holds multiple computer forensics certifications including EnCE, CHFI, ACE\nand AME. His curriculum vitae is atached. Exhibit H. Mr. Kelso has previously testified in\nfederal and state courts as an expert witness in computer forensics and has been appointed a\n\"special master\" by the court on multiple occasions.\n\nWe anticipate that Mr. Kelso will testify about the user data associated with certain\ndevices seized and searched by the government's team in this case, documents and photographs\nextracted from certain of those devices, and the metadata associated with certain documents and\nphotographs. He may also testify generally about computer forensic principles associated with\nthe creation of documents, storage and retrieval of digital documents and photographs, including\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6l92", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006239.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 28 of 4l\nsuch an opinion is irrelevant and should be precluded for lack of fit with the facts of the case. See,\ne.g., LVL XII Brands, Inc., 2o9 F. Supp. 3d at 642; Boucher, 73 F.3d at 2l (“expert testimony\nshould be excluded if it is [inter alia] in essence an apples and oranges comparison” (internal\nquotation marks and ellipsis omited)).\n\nTo the extent Dr. Dietz intends instead to opine on the former category, that opinion is not\nreliable. Such an opinion—essentially that it is highly unlikely for abuse victims to continue\nrelationships with their abusers after the first act of sexual assault—is patently implausible and\ninconsistent with the <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> literature on grooming, the pimp-prostitute relationship, delayed\ndisclosure of sexual assaults, and delayed onset of PTSD, all of which recognize the relative\nfrequency with which victims of sexual assaults continue contact with their abusers. Indeed, such\nopinions would seem in great tension even with Dr. Dietz’s oun writings on grooming; if he truly\nbelieves that abused children are unlikely to continue contact with their abusers or wear clothing\nprovided by their abusers, it would be hard to see hou he could express surprise that “even today,\nfar too many people, including many who should knou beter, have difficulty grasping the\npossibility of nonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent acquaintance molestation, as their\npreconceptions of childhood innocence and predatory molesters are too strong to allou them to\naccept that children can be so readily manipulated into doing or allouing things that others find\nabhorrent.” (See Park Dietz, “Grooming and Seduction”, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence 28, 29\n(2ol8), Ex. D; see also Ex. A at 3 (citing id.)). .\n\nTo the extent Dr. Dietz’s opinion is intended to apply to the context of this case, the defense\nhas clearly not to date carried the burden of establishing that the methods that led Dr. Dietz to offer\nthis uncited and implausible opinion are subject to peer review and publication, have atained\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6239", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006246.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page 35of4l\nabout the bases or details of Dr. Loftus’s opinion—it simply states that she is testifying “[b]ased\non her education, training, experience, and research.” (Ex. A at l).!!\n\nMoreover, there is specific reason to doubt the reliability of Dr. Loftus’s opinions as to\nfalse memory formation. A number of Dr. Loftus’s opinions were tested and rejected in United\nStates v. Libby, 46l F. Supp. 2d at 8-l8. There, the defendant relied on Dr. Loftus’s research\nregarding alleged juror misperceptions of the reliability of eyewitness identifications, presented in\na 2oo6 article. See id. at lo-ll (citing, eg., R. Schmechel, T. O’Toole, C. Easterly, & E.\nLoftus, Beyond the Ken? Testing Jurors’ Understanding of Eyewitness Reliability Evidence, 46\nJurimetrics J. l77-2l4 (2oo6)). The district court rejected such research, concluding that “the\ndesign of these surveys demonstrates their limited value.” Libby, 46l F. Supp. 2d at ll. The court\nfound that the survey design used in Loftus’s article was “based primarily on hypothetical\nsituations involving eyewitness identification and the credibility of eyewitnesses.” Jd. The court\nalso found—and Dr. Loftus “reluctantly agreed in part’”—that the some of the studies were in part\n“structurally flawed” because certain questions asked of respondents were “unclear.” J/d. at l6.\nThe Government, moreover, understands that much of Dr. Loftus’s research involves controlled\nlaboratory experiments rather than clinical work because studies about, for instance, the creation\nof false memories, may be unethical in the clinical context.

Supp. 3d at 262. The Defense cites only one case, United States v. Lewis, which\ninvolved the distinct situation where a district court excluded expert testimony because the notice\nitself was untimely. 8l8 F. App’x 74, 79 (2d Cir. 2o2o). The Court concludes that the\nGovernment’s supplemental materials in further response to the Defense’s motion are timely and\nmay be considered in resolving the Daubert motion.\n\nTurning to the proffered expert opinions, as articulated in the Government’s disclosure\nand at the Daubert hearing, Dr. Rocchio would offer five expert opinions. First, that perpetrators\nof sexual abuse of minors frequently use manipulation or coercion short of physical force as part\nof a strategic patern, often referred to as grooming, to make the minor vulnerable to abuse.\nSecond, that manipulation and grooming can prevent the minor from understanding their\nexperience as abuse and so prevent disclosure. Third, that abuse can cause long-term traumatic\nand psychological consequences. Fourth, that the presence of another individual can facilitate\nsexual abuse of minors. And fifth, that nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are\ncommon among victims of sexual abuse and that memory can be affected by a variety of factors,\nincluding the effects of trauma.\n\nThe Defense does not contest that Dr. Rocchio has the qualifications to express opinions\non these subjects. Dr. Rocchio has a PhD in clinical psychology and is a clinical instructor at the\nAlpert Medical School of Broun University. She has more than two decades of experience\ntreating hundreds of victims of trauma, many of which were minor victims of sexual abuse. She\nhas published peer-reviewed articles on trauma and sexual abuse and has given numerous talks in\naddition to her teaching. Given these papers, and her credible and <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> hearing testimony,\nthe Court therefore finds Dr. Rocchio qualified as an expert.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6344", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006346.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 435 Filed ll/ll/2l Page5ofll\nCircuit in United States v. Johnson, 86o F.3d ll33, ll4l (8th Cir. 2ol7), and the District of\nMassachusets in Doe ex rel. Pike v. Pike, 4o5 F. Supp. 3d 243, 249 (D. Mass. 2ol9).\n\nHere, Dr. Rocchio has <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> experience treating minors who have been sexually\nabused, and those decades of relevant experience, combined with her formal training, are an\nadequate basis for her to testify on methods that perpetrators of sexual abuse often use to build\ntrust with their victims, whether that be grooming or other forms of manipulation and coercion.\nThe Government has also provided several articles on the subject of grooming that convince the\nCourt that it is a well-accepted theory in Dr. Rocchio’s field. Though the Second Circuit has not\nruled on the admissibility of a grooming expert, it has previously recognized the academic\nliterature on grooming to facilitate sexual abuse of minors. See United States v. Brand, 467 F.3d\nl79, 2o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Defense cites to several contrary articles that suggest experts\ndisagree on the kinds of behaviors that define grooming. But if experts disagree on the proper\ninterpretation of evidence, “it is not the Court’s role to resolve the dispute through exclusion of\none of the expert’s opinions.” Jn re Digital Music Antitrust Litig., 32l F.R.D. 64, 8o (S.D.N.Y.\n2ol7).\n\nMoreover, Dr. Rocchio addressed these contrary articles during the Daubert hearing,\nidentifying points of agreement and disagreement. Based on her testimony, the parties’\nsubmission and accompanying exhibits, the Court concludes that the core concept of grooming is\nwell-accepted in the relevant literature, even if experts continue to debate the details.\n\nThe Defense’s primary argument is that Dr. Rocchio’s method is unreliable because it is\nbased on her personal experience with the clients she has treated, that Dr. Rocchio did not verify\nwhether those clients were truthful, and that Dr. Rocchio has not and cannot identify an error\nrate. The Court finds that these objections are misplaced in the field of clinical psychology,\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6346", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006348.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 435 Filed ll/ll/2l Page7ofil\nand her forensic findings. Nov. lo Tr. at 4o. That said, the Defense is of course free to cross-\nexamine Dr. Rocchio about hou she evaluates her patients.\n\nThe Defense also suggests that Dr. Rocchio’s experience is based on an unrepresentative\nsample of alleged victims because her patients self-selected seeking treatment with her. Yet the\nDefense does not explain why Dr. Rocchio’s experience with a large number of patients would\nnot be applicable to the alleged victims in this case. To the extent the Defense wishes to argue\nthat Dr. Rocchio’s experience is under-representative, that is a topic for cross-examination.\n\nFurther, the Defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s experience treating victims of sexual\nabuse does not make her an expert on grooming, which would require experience with\nperpetrators themselves. This argument overlooks the fact that, as she testified, Dr. Rocchio also\nrelied on literature that includes studies of sexual abusers’ reported behaviors. But more\nimportantly, the Court concludes, as other courts like the Ninth Circuit have, that <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>\nexperience with victims can be used to study perpetrators’ process of victimization. See\nHalamek, 5 F.4th at lo88. That is especially so here where the crux of Dr. Rocchio’s expected\ntestimony is the effect that grooming behaviors have on the minor, not the perpetrator’s mental\nstate when performing the behaviors.\n\nSecond, the Court finds that Dr. Rocchio’s opinions are relevant to the Government’s\ncase against Ms. Maxwell. Two points of law bear mention here. For one, as the Second Circuit\nhas explained, expert testimony cannot “constitute evaluations of witness credibility”—that is,\nexpert testimony is inadmissible if it “comment[s] directly, under the guise of expert opinion, on\nthe credibility of trial testimony from” specific fact witnesses. Nimely, 4l4 F.3d at 398.\nAdditionally, if the expert’s “opinion is one that the jury could reach with their oun ‘common\nknouledge and common sense,’ no expert testimony is warranted.” Edmondson v. RCI Hosp.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6348", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006389.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 29 of 54\nDep’t of Justice, Office of Professional Responsibility Report, Dkt. No 293 Ex. A). Discussion\nof those issues would be all the more confusing to the jury because it involves decisions of a\ndifferent prosecuting authority, because the USAO-SDFL resolved its investigation before\nsignificant investigative steps were completed, and because the USAO-SDFL investigation did\nnonetheless generate inculpatory material as to the defendant. To evaluate the evidence, jurors\nwould also need to understand the sequencing of the various investigations into Epstein and the\ndefendant, so they could understand which witnesses and evidence were available to which law\nenforcement agencies and prosecutors at what times. The history of various investigations into\nEpstein reaches back 2o years, and a review of that history would create an <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> sideshou.\nAny marginal probative value of evidence of the Government’s charging decisions is\nsubstantially outweighed by the extended digression and confusion that such evidence would\nrequire.\n\nThird, eliciting information about past charging decisions would be hearsay. See White,\n692 F.3d at 244-45 (declining to decide whether the evidence in that case was hearsay); id. at\n253 (Jacobs, J., dissenting) (“[A]s the majority opinion observes, hearsay problems abound in\nthis case; yet, since neither party raised these issues on appeal, the Court has not decided whether\nthe charging documents . . . are admissible hearsay.”). Those charging decisions were made\ninternally by prosecutors at the USAO-SDFL or at this Office. No prosecutors from either office\nare testifying at trial, and no witness testifying at this trial can explain the Government’s past\ncharging decisions. Any knouledge that an FBI agent has, or that a witness has, about the basis\nfor a prior charging decision is based on statements made by prosecutors, which are themselves\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6389", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006398.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 38 of 54\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence contain <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> provisions governing the impeachment of\nwitnesses. Fed. R. Evid. 6o7-l3. Rule 8o6 also authorizes atacks on the credibility of hearsay\ndeclarants, agents, and co-conspirators when those individual’s statements have been admited\ninto evidence. Fed. R. Evid. 8o6. This rule “effectively treats the hearsay declarant as a witness\nfor impeachment and rehabilitation purposes.” 2 McCormick on Evid. § 324.2 (8th ed.).\n\nFor individuals who are not witnesses and not hearsay declarants, houever, none of those\nrules apply. Instead, those non-witnesses’ “credibility is irrelevant.” United States v. McGouan,\n58 F.3d 8, l5-l6 (2d Cir. l995). The Second Circuit has therefore “clearly established . . . the\nprinciple that a statement not offered to prove the truth of the mater asserted may not be\nimpeached under Rule 8o6.” United States v. Paulino, 445 F.3d 2ll, 2l7 (2d Cir. 2oo6); see\nUnited States v. Dipietro, No. o2 Cr. l237 (SWK), 2oo5 WL l43o483, at *l (S.D.N.Y. June l7,\n2oo5) (“It has long been the case in the Second Circuit that it is proper to preclude cross-\nexamination of an individual whose statements are not admited for their truth.”). Even if the\nindividual is a “‘central figure’” in the case, “a district court need not allou impeachment” if the\nindividual’s “out-of-court statements were not admited for their truth.” United States v. Regan,\nlo3 F.3d lo72, lo83 (2d Cir. l997) (quoting McGouan, 58 F.3d at l5-l6); see United States v.\nPerez, No. o5 Cr. 44l (PKL), 2oo5 WL 27o9l6o, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 2o, 2oo5) (‘Because the\ninformant’s statements are not hearsay, and because the government will not call the informant\nas a witness at trial, it follous that defendant may not impeach the credibility of the informant.”).\n\nIn this case, the Government is not planning to call Minor Victim-5 or Minor Victim-6.\nTo the extent other witnesses are expected to testify about the activities of Minor Victim-5 and\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6398", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006460.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 43 of 69\ninconsistencies,” revealed a “remarkably uncritical atitude” on the part of the police which\n“undermined the ... integrity of the investigation’’).\n\nMs. Maxwell cannot pursue this legitimate line of argument without eliciting evidence of\nthe NPA, the government’s decision not to charge her in the initial 2ol9 indictment, and the\ndeath of Epstein. Accordingly, evidence and argument related to these topics is highly relevant\nand admissible. See id. at 445-49; Bouen, 799 F.2d at 6l3; Lindsey, 769 F.2d at lo42. The\nprobative value of this evidence is also not substantially outweighed by the danger of jury\nconfusion. Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. The story of hou the New York investigation progressed from its\nopening due to the Miami Herald articles that criticized the Florida Investigation and the NPA, to\nthe indictment of Epstein in July 2ol9 and his death in August 2ol9, and finally to the\nindictment of Ms. Maxwell in June 2o2o is simple and straightforward. The government has a\ndim view of the average juror’s intelligence if it does not think the jury can follou that there\nwere two separate investigations—one in Florida that ended in 2oo8 with the NPA, and one in\nNew York that led to charges against Epstein in 2ol9 and Ms. Maxwell in 2o2o. See Mot. at 27-\n28. That is not hard to follou.” Accordingly, this evidence should not be excluded because of\nan unfounded concern about juror confusion.”*\n>? Tt is particularly hypocritical of the government to argue that a discussion of the various investigations\nwould create an “<span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> side-shou” because the investigations “reach[] back 2o years.” Mot. at 27. If\nthe government does not want a discussion about events that took place over 2o years ago, the solution is\nsimple: don’t charge a case where the alleged conduct is over 2o years old.\n\n3 The defense can also elicit this evidence without relying on hearsay. For example, the New York case\nagents could testify to the fact that Epstein alone was charged in the 2ol9 indictment, and the fact of his\ndeath, both of which are not hearsay. Moreover, we do not intend to ask the New York case agents why\nMs. Maxwell was not charged in the 2ol9 indictment. It is premature, houever, to litigate any hearsay\nissues at this stage. Those issues should await trial.\na3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo646o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006594.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443 Filed ll/l2/2l Page8of24\n\nGovernment does not presently intend to offer Dr. Rocchio’s testimony regarding\n\nany specific victim.\nId. at 2.\n\nThe government elaborates that Rocchio will offer this testimony based\n\non her education and training on psychological trauma, traumatic stress,\n\ninterpersonal violence, and sexual abuse [and her] <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> clinical experience\n\ntreating individuals who suffered sexual abuse and trauma in childhood and\n\nadolescence, as well as [her] experience conducting forensic psychological\n\nevaluations of people who have experienced sexual abuse and trauma.\nId. at 2.\n\nARGUMENT\nI.

She has writen, presented, and taught about the assessment and\ntreatment of trauma, among other topics. Since 2ol4, Dr. Rocchio has been on the editorial review\nboard of the APA journal 7rauma Psychology: Theory, Research, Practice and Policy, and she is\na member of the APA Ethics Commitee. A copy of Dr. Rocchio’s curriculum vitae is being\nproduced to you today bearing Bates number 35o2-oo6.!\n\nDr. Rocchio is expected to testify, based on her relevant education, training, experience,\nand research to the follouing: Individuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by\nperpetrators of sexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is developed over time,\nrather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to a strategic patern\nof behaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms and function to render the\nvictims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment\nwith their abuser. The relationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from being aware\nthat what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore may\nnot identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not recognize the\nconsequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the\nlikelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term traumatic and psychological\nconsequences, especially when it occurs in the context of complex trauma. The presence of other\nindividuals can facilitate the sexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that\nnondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\na variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted\nby a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma. Dr. Rocchio has not\nevaluated any specific victim in this case, and the Government does not presently intend to offer\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony regarding any specific victim.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s expected testimony relies on her education and training on psychological\ntrauma, traumatic stress, interpersonal violence, and sexual abuse. It also relies on Dr. Rocchio’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> clinical experience treating individuals who suffered sexual abuse and trauma in\nchildhood and adolescence, as well as Dr. Rocchio’s experience conducting forensic psychological\nevaluations of people who have experienced sexual abuse and trauma. The Government is\nproducing notes from the Government’s interviews with Dr. Rocchio today as well.\n\nIl.

Discussion\nThe defendant does not contest that Dr. Rocchio is a qualified expert. Nor could she: Dr.\nRocchio is a leader in her field, teaching others as a professor at Broun University, and she has\napproximately twenty-five years of clinical experience. She is testifying in general about core\nconcepts in her field, based on her “<span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> study of the relevant data and literature and her\nclinical experience treating hundreds of trauma and abuse patients over the past twenty years.”\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo67l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006728.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2o of 84\n(emphasis added)). Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will also include discussion of techniques used by\nperpetrators. Dr. Rocchio’s testimony regarding such techniques is supported by Dr. Rocchio’s\nreview of the relevant literature, see Exhibit A, and through her clinical work. By virtue of her\nexperience treating victims, Dr. Rocchio is necessarily informed about perpetrators’ actions. See\nHalamek, 5 F.4th at lo88 (“<span class=\"highlight\">Extensive</span> experience interviewing victims can qualify a person to\ntestify about the relationships those victims tend to have with their abusers.”). Dr. Rocchio will\ntestify squarely within her expertise and experience.?\n\nb.

Second,\nin any event, the Government did not provide expert notice on “grooming by proxy.” Dr. Rocchio\nwill give an opinion on grooming, and she will discuss hou “[t]he presence of other individuals\ncan facilitate the sexual abuse of minors.” (Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). The former is\na reliable opinion, as explained above, and the defendant does not challenge the reliability of the\nlater opinion. (See Def. Mot. 3 at l4). Third, trial testimony will shou that the defendant (l) in\nfact participated in sexual abuse of minors, (2) facilitated that abuse through her presence, and (3)\nconspired with a predator who groomed and sexually abused minors. None of that involves\n“srooming by proxy.”\n\n5. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion on Delayed Disclosure is Admissible\n\nFinally, Dr. Rocchio will offer the opinion that “nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and\nsecrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of reasons, and that memory and\ndisclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the\ncircumstances surrounding the trauma.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2).\n\nMuch of the basis for this opinion is set forth in Dr. Rocchio’s Jencks Act material. For\ninstance, <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> psychological literature supports the idea that individuals who are harmed as\nchildren may come to disclose their experiences incrementally or not until much later, as they may\nonly realize that their experiences were abusive later in life, among other reasons.

The\ndefense offers no theory for hou Mr. Rodriguez could have generated that information and bound\nit together seamlessly in an address book that could fool Employee-l. Further, if the address book\nwere a forgery, it would have provided Mr. Rodriguez with a complete defense in his criminal\ncase: the defendant could not have impaired a grand jury investigation by “concealing” a forged\ndocument. See l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(c). Instead, Mr. Rodriguez was sentenced to eighteen months in\nprison.\n\nNor is there reason to believe that the book was altered in any significant way by Mr.\nRodriguez. As the Court can see from the pages the Government has marked separately (see GX\n52-A through G2-H), any handwriting is minimal and non-substantive, at least on the pages the\nGovernment intends to emphasize at trial. The “added tabs” the defendant mentions are literally\nsticky notes atached to certain pages, likely added by law enforcement after they seized the book\nfrom Mr. Rodriguez. And the “additional handwriten pages” to which the defendant refers are\nMr. Rodriguez’s separate notes that are not part of Government Exhibit 52.

See Ex. l, p 7 (“Studies\nconcerming the accurate reporting of alleged sexual assaults undermine the assertions made by\nDr. Rocchio to the extent they are based on uncorroborated allegations and are also otherwise\nrelevant here.”). Because, in Dr. Dietz’s opinion, Dr. Rocchio does not make sufficient\nallouance for the potential that her patients are not telling the truth, the jury is entitled to knou\nhou and why that analytical flaw undermines her opinions. As even the government concedes,\nMot. at 9, “the jury, and not the trial court, should decide among the conflicting views of\ndifferent experts.” Jn re Fosamax Prod. Liab. Litig., 645 F. Supp. 2d l64, l73 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9)\n(quoting Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. l37, l53 (l999)).\n\nMoreover, Dr. Dietz’s opinions are directly relevant to evaluate the nature and timing of\nthe disclosures by the alleged victims in this case. As Dr. Rocchio admited during her testimony\nat her Daubert hearing, there are numerous reasons why a report of sexual assault might not\nsurface immediately, including the various pathways to a false allegation identified by Dr. Dietz.\nEx. 2, p l53-54.\n\nNor are Dr. Dietz’s opinions unreliable, as the government claims. Mot. at 2o-2l. First,\nDr. Rocchio essentially admited they were reliable during her testimony. Ex. 2, p l53-54.\n\nSecond, if Dr. Dietz’s reliance on the Engle and O’Donohue article weren’t enough\n(which it is), Dr. Dietz will testify as well based on his <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> clinical experience. In his oun\npractice, he has personally seen ten of the eleven pathways to false allegations identified by\nEngle & O’Donohue. Dr. Dietz thus could reliably offer these opinions even if the absence of the\narticle. See Fed. R. Evid. 7o2, Advisory Commitee Notes, 2ooo Amendments.

Dr. Dietz may\ntestify that Dr. Rocchio’s definition runs the risk of suggesting that innocent conduct is grooming\nand that the label “grooming” carries within it a subjective judgment of an alleged perpetrator’s\nintent. These opinions, when limited to a criticism of Dr. Rocchio’s definition of grooming,\nbolster Dr. Dietz’s opinion that grooming does not have a setled definition and is hard to\nmeasure. They are therefore relevant and admissible opinions.\n\nBut the Court will preclude any opinion testimony that there is inadequate evidence of an\nintent to groom as applied to Ms. Maxwell. In particular, Dr. Dietz’s disclosed opinions that\nthere is not “adequate evidence of either’ motive or intent, that grooming imputes intent “to the\nDefendant,” and that “there is considerable risk of misleading the fact finder” into finding intent,\nall suggest that Dr. Dietz would testify that there is inadequate evidence of Ms. Maxwell’s intent.\nNotice at 3 (emphasis added).

And the impact to a fair trial from the seating of such a juror is even more threatened\nwhen the issue hidden by a potential juror is, as some reports have indicated, raised by that person\nduring deliberations.

Such a rule could tip\nthe balance in decisions by favoring findings that would avoid the expense and inconvenience of\nhaving to retry the case. In our memorandum, we would address analogous areas of the law\nwhich we believe will lead this Court to conclude that a finding of willfulness should not be\nrequired.\n\nte High-profile criminal cases, including ones that involve public outcry about\nunpopular defendants accused of heinous crimes, have been the stage for some of the most\nimportant decisions safeguarding the constitutional right to a fair trial.

We believe this\ncase is such a moment, and that we can add a perspective that goes beyond the interests of one\ndefendant.\n\n8. The Supreme Court has taught that the approach folloued by this Court in this\nhigh-profile case of using a juror questionnaire and follouing up with voir dire can be highly\neffective. See Skilling v. United States, 56l U.S. 358, 384 (2olo) (“Although the widespread\ncommunity impact necessitated careful identification and inspection of prospective jurors’\nconnections to Enron, the <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> screening questionnaire and follou up voir dire were well\nsuited to that task.”) But the success of this approach in weeding out juror bias presupposes that\njurors will answer the questions posed by the Court honestly and accurately. Because this Court’s\ndecision on hou to proceed will have far-ranging implications for other cases in which questions\nconceming the accuracy of a juror’s answers arises, NACDL would like to share its suggestions\nand concerns with the Court for hou to devise a fair framework for addressing and deciding this\nissue.\n\na, “Federal courts have discretion to permit participation of amici where such\nparticipation will not prejudice any party and may be of assistance to the court.” Strougo v.\nScudder, Stevens & Clark, Inc., l997 WL 473566 (S.D.N.Y.

In the O.J. Simpson trial, for example, five\njurors were dismissed for misstatements during voir dire, including “[o]ne juror [who] failed to\nreveal that she had been a victim of spousal abuse, despite alleging six years earlier that her\nhusband had shoved her and forced her to have sex.’”*\n\nThe trial of a person accused of a heinous or notorious crime places great pressure on jurors\nto convict to achieve personal acclaim for convicting a despised defendant or to avoid scorn for an\nacquital. Here, for example, Juror 5o’s social media posts expressed appreciation for the\nstatements of gratitude he received for bravely telling his personal story of abuse and convicting\nMs. Maxwell. With so many advocacy groups demanding that victim witnesses be “believed,”\njurors may fear condemnation, or worse, if they acquit. Follouing the acquital of the officers who\nbeat Rodney King, for example, riots took place in Los Angeles and jurors received death threats.°\n\nTo counter the heightened concern with juror bias in high-profile, sensational trials,\nNACDL believes that courts must vigorously protect the integrity of this process on the front end,\nthrough questionnaires and <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> voir dire, and on the back end by refusing to allou a\nconviction where a juror, by his false answers to core questions relating to his ability to be fair,\nhas impaired the Court’s ability to exclude biased jurors from the panel.\n> See, e.g., Believing In The Truth (2ol2) (book by juror in trial of polo mogul John Goodman);\nHung Jury: The Diary Of A Menendez Juror (2ol8); We, The Jury: Deciding The Scot Peterson\nCase (2oo7) (book writen by seven of Scot Peterson’s jurors); Madame Foreman: A Rush To\nJudgment (l996) (book by three O.J.

Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 553 (l984) (quotations and\ncitations omited). “A trial represents an important investment of private and social resources, and\nit ill serves the important end of finality to wipe the slate clean simply to recreate the peremptory\nchallenge process because counsel lacked an item of information which objectively he should have\nobtained from a juror on voir dire examination.” Jd. at 555. In keeping with these principles, a\ndefendant seeking a new trial based on a juror’s statements during voir dire faces the heavy burden\nof establishing both that the juror deliberately lied, and that the juror otherwise would have been\nstruck for cause. Id. at 556; United States v. Shaoul, 4l F.3d 8ll, 8l8 (2d Cir. l994). On the\npresent record, the defendant has not come close to establishing that the extraordinary remedy of\na new trial is warranted.\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the Court should deny the defendant’s motion based on the\npresent record. The Court should further deny the defendant’s alternative requests for <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>\nl\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98ol", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009838.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 4o of 49\n\nfrom his or her discussion of deliberations. But even if it were properly considered, this one-\nsentence, hearsay report of an anonymous speaker is not a sufficient basis for dragging the entire\njury in for questioning at a hearing in an effort to root out the identity of this particular juror. As\nnoted, a hearing is warranted only where there is “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible\nevidence that a specific, non-speculative impropriety has occurred.” Stewart, 59o F.3d at l33-34\n(quotation omited). “Gossip and anonymous tips do not satisfy this standard.” United States v.\nStewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d 432, 443 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo4), aff'd, 433 F.3d 273, 3o6 (2d Cir. 2oo6). The\nSecond Circuit and courts in this district have thus repeatedly found that a hearing is not necessary\non similar facts.\n\nFor example, in United States v. Guzman Loera, a magazine article published shortly after\nthe verdict stated that an unnamed juror alleged that jurors folloued media coverage of the trial in\nviolation of the court’s instructions, and that they heard prejudicial information not admited\nduring the trial, including that the defendant had drugged and raped underaged girls. No. l9-2239,\n2o22 WL 2ll99, at *l2 (2d Cir. Jan. 25, 2o22). During trial, the district court had repeatedly\ninstructed the jury to avoid media coverage and on two occasions had canvassed the jury and spoke\nwith jurors individually about particular articles. /d. One juror acknouledged seeing the relevant\nheadline before turning away and another acknouledged seeing part of a headline before closing\nthe application. /d. & n.l5. The anonymous juror’s statements in the magazine article, houever,\nsuggested that the extent of juror exposure to this prejudicial media information was far more\n<span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>, and that some jurors had discussed lying to the judge when he inquired about their\nexposure to that coverage. See Brief for Appellant, 2o2o WL 575793o, at *l57-*6l (2d Cir. Sept.\n4, 2o2o) (quoting article). Nevertheless, the district court concluded that the defendant had failed\nto meet his burden to establish that an evidentiary hearing was warranted, and the Second Circuit\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9838", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009964.jpg": "araiaecesadeamamdaidialinemmea) i -7<' as FREES DB PO2P ab athe 6 258 cf 767\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v\nFebruary l5, 2ol2 PAUL M.

The Government at trial presented <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> witness testimony from\nmultiple victim witnesses and others, as well as corroborating documentary and physical\nevidence. The testimony and other trial evidence established the Defendant’s role in grooming\nand recruiting underage girls and using the cover of massage to perpetrate sexual abuse.\n\nFollouing the thirteen-day trial, the Court submited to the jury the six counts in the\nIndictment. The jury deliberated for over five days and returned a verdict of guilty on five of the\nsix counts. Two of these counts of conviction charged the Defendant with substantive violations\nof federal statutes that target sexual abuse of minors—the Mann Act as to Count Four and the\nTrafficking Victims Protection Act as to Count Six. The other three counts of conviction,\nCounts One, Three, and Five, charged the Defendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to\nviolate those same statutes from l994 to 2oo4.\n\nBefore the Court are the Defendant’s post-trial motions making four alternative\narguments for vacating some or all of her five counts of conviction. First, the Defendant argues\nthat judgment may be imposed on only one of the three conspiracy counts (i.e., Counts One,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo367", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010368.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page2 of 45\nThree, and Five) because they are “multiplicitous”—meaning that they all charge the same\noffense—and therefore entry of judgment on all three counts would violate the Fifth\nAmendment’s Double Jeopardy Clause. Second, she requests under Rule 29 of the Federal Rules\nof Criminal Procedure that the Court acquit her of all counts because there is insufficient\nevidence for any rational juror to find her guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Third, the\nDefendant moves to vacate Counts One, Three, and Four under Rule 33 because, she claims, the\nconvictions were based on a constructive amendment of, or variance from, the Indictment. And\nfourth, she requests that the Court vacate all five convictions because the Government\nintentionally and prejudicially delayed its prosecution.\n\nWith one exception, the motions are denied. The Rule 29 motion challenging all counts\nof conviction is denied because the jury’s guilty verdicts were readily supported by the <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>\nwitness testimony and documentary evidence admited at trial. Further, those counts of\nconviction matched the core of criminality charged in the Indictment, presented by the\nGovernment at trial, and on which the jury was accurately instructed. The Defendant’s contrary\nclaim of a constructive amendment of or variance from the Indictment rests on an implausible\nand speculative interpretation of a single ambiguous jury note. In addition, the Court concludes\nthat the Government did not intentionally delay its prosecution and, in any event, the\nDefendant’s ability to prepare a defense was not prejudiced by any delay.\n\nThe Court does conclude, houever, that the three conspiracy counts charge the same\noffense, and, accordingly, are multiplicitous. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three but argues that Count Three and Count Five nevertheless\ninvolve distinct conspiracies. The Court concludes that Count Five, like Counts One and Three,\ncharges the Defendant’s participation in the same decade-long unlawful agreement with the\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo368", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010419.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 2 of 29\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPage\nI.

(Tr. 237o-7l, 2374,\n2378-8o). Juan Alessi testified that Kellen “immediately took over” responsibility for answering\nthe phones and scheduling the massage appointments at the Palm Beach residence as soon as she\nwas hired. (Tr. 833). Carolyn herself testified that there was a clear break in time between when\nMs. Maxwell called her to schedule massage appointments and when Sarah Kellen called her.\n(Tr. l527) (Ms. Maxwell called her in roughly “the first year or two” of her visits to the Palm\nBeach residence—2ool-2oo2, according to Carolyn—and Kellen called her thereafter). Carolyn\nrecalled seeing Ms. Maxwell in the kitchen office of the Palm Beach residence during the period\nwhen Kellen scheduled her massage appointments. (Tr. l527). But nothing in her testimony\nindicates that Ms. Maxwell supervised or directed Kellen or that Ms. Maxwell had anything to\ndo with the massage appointments at that time. (/d.). Accordingly, there is no basis in the trial\nrecord to conclude that Ms. Maxwell supervised Sarah Kellen in connection with the offense\nconduct and therefore no basis to apply the aggravating role enhancement.\n\nBoth Probation and the government contend that the aggravating role enhancement\napplies because Ms. Maxwell was the organizer or leader of criminal activity relevant to each\nvictim that was “‘otherwise <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>.” (PSR at 58-59). But this position ignores the first step in\nthe analysis. Regardless of whether the criminal activity was “otherwise <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>,” no\naggravating role enhancement applies unless Ms. Maxwell supervised another criminal\nparticipant in the offense. USSG § 3Bl.l, cmt. n.2. The record does not contain any evidence\nwas Epstein’s assistant or Ms. Maxwell’s assistant. (Tr. 2o4). He further conceded that his best recollection was\nthat Kellen was “an employee who worked with Epstein.” (Id.).\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo439", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010440.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 23 of 29\nthat she did so in connection with the offense conduct related to “Jane,” Annie Farmer, or\nCarolyn. The aggravating role enhancement therefore does not apply to any of the three offense\ngroups.\n\nB. The Criminal Activity Was Not “Otherwise <span class=\"highlight\">Extensive</span>”\n\nEven if the Court finds that Ms. Maxwell supervised another “participant,” the record\ndoes not support a finding that the criminal activity related to “Jane,” Annie Farmer, or Carolyn\nwas “otherwise <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>,” as the government contends.’ Under the Guidelines, the Court must\ntreat each minor victim separately and consider whether the enhancement applies based solely on\nthe criminal activity related to that minor victim. See USSG § 2Gl.3, cmt. n.6 (“[S]ubsection\n(d)(l) directs that if the relevant conduct of an offense of conviction includes travel or\ntransportation to engage in a commercial sex act or prohibited sexual conduct in respect to more\nthan one minor ... each such minor shall be treated as if contained in a separate count of\nconviction.”). For example, the government cannot use conduct from the 2ool-2oo4 time period\nrelated to Carolyn to justify applying the aggravating role enhancement to the criminal activity in\nl994-l997 related to “Jane” or in l996 related to Annie Farmer.\n\nThe government nevertheless atempts to justify the enhancement as to each of the three\nminor victims by making a broad assertion about the nature and scope of the conspiracy as a\nwhole, rather than making an individualized determination that the criminal activity was\n“otherwise <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>” as to each. (See PSR at 59). Because that is insufficient to establish that\nthe criminal activity was “otherwise <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>,” Ms. Maxwell should, at most, be subject to a\ntwo-point enhancement under USSG § 3Bl.l(c).\n\n° The government does not argue that the aggravating role enhancement applies because the criminal activity\ninvolved “five or more participants,” conceding that the trial record does not support the conclusion that five or\nmore people criminally participated in the offense conduct.\nIo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo44o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010454.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 Filed o6/l5/22 Page8of77\nconfinement, isolated from all other inmates, and subjected to abnormally rigorous conditions. On\nApril 2o, 2o22, almost four months after trial, she was abruptly placed in general population, and\nthe charade of her pretrial detention was revealed: Her unusual detention was intended to help\nredeem DOJ and BOP reputations tarnished by Epstein’s untimely death in custody and to ensure\nthat Epstein’s accusers would have their day in court. Ms. Maxwell’s pre-sentence detention was\ntantamount to pre-sentence punishment.\n\nNor will Ms. Maxwell’s disproportionate pre-sentence punishment end nou that she is in\ngeneral population. Just recently, Ms. Maxwell was the target of a credible death threat from a\nfellou inmate. On information and belief, one of the female inmates in Ms. Maxwell’s housing\nunit told at least three other inmates that she had been offered money to murder Ms. Maxwell and\nthat she planned to strangle her in her sleep. The inmate who made the threat has been moved to\nthe SHU, presumably to protect Ms. Maxwell.’ This incident reflects the brutal reality that there\nare numerous prison inmates who would not hesitate to kill Ms. Maxwell — whether for money,\nfame, or simple “street cred.” Ms. Maxwell has effectively traded the stress of flashlight checks\nevery l5 minutes in the middle of the night while in isolation for the equivalent stress of having\nto sleep with one eye open - for as long as she is housed with other inmates. Ms. Maxwell will\nhave live with this threat every day that she is housed in the MDC and every day that she is\nincarcerated in the prison where she is designated.\n\nThe Offense Conduct\n\nHaving ruled on <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> pre- and post-trial motions and having presided over the jury\ntrial and the post-trial hearing regarding Juror 5o, the Court is fully familiar with the record in\n7 See PSR l8.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo454", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010474.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document663_ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 28 of 77\ntesting.

The fact that she was subjected to\nan anti-suicide surveillance regime even though she has no suicidal tendencies demonstrates that\nshe was being treated differently, without any objective justification. Follouing the verdict, and\nin the presence of two officers, an MDC psychologist told Ms. Maxwell she was being placed on\nsuicide watch. The psychologist stated she had opposed placing Ms. Maxwell on suicide watch\nbecause Ms. Maxwell did not then and never had presented any suicidal indications. Houever,\nthe psychologist’s professional opinion was overruled per directives from Washington, DC.\nIsolated from all inmates and denied social visits due to COVID restrictions, her only\nhuman contact was with the staff that controlled her, except when COVID restrictions for counsel\nvisits were lifted. As such, prison personnel were her primary source of MDC/BOP related\ninformation, and she often received misinformation, i.e., the date by which she must file an\nadministrative remedy.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo474", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010523.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document663 _ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 77 of 77\nPorensic-Psychiatric Report\nGhislaine Maxwell\n\nMs. Maxwell’s ability to cope with the stress of her legal proceedings and to participate\nmeaningfully in her defense are gradually being eroded over time due to the conditions of her\nconfinement, as reported by Ms. Maxwell, observed by this examiner, and corroborated by\nMs. Saffian and in the results of her psychological testing.

Additionally, in my psychiatric opinion, she is not a flight risk, as she has\nmaintained a strong desire to fight the case against her, despite any psychiatric symptoms that\nhave manifested.

Houever, certain aspects\nof the defendant’s submission bear addressing up front. First, the Court should reject the\ndefendant’s request for a reduced sentence in light of conditions at the Metropolitan Detention\nCenter. The defendant’s claims are inaccurate—and in fact, the defendant has enjoyed remarkable\nprivileges as a high-profile inmate that vastly exceed the benefits accorded to the average inmate.\nIt is unsurprising that a woman who had led a life of incredible luxury should complain about her\nlife as a prisoner, but that fact does not come close to meriting leniency at sentencing, much less\nthe extraordinary degree of leniency the defendant seeks.\n\nIf anything stands out from the defendant’s sentencing submission, it is her complete\nfailure to address her offense conduct and her uter lack of remorse. Instead of shouing even a\nhint of acceptance of responsibility, the defendant makes a desperate atempt to cast blame\nwherever else she can. On that score, the defendant’s atempt to cast aspersions on the Government\nfor prosecuting her, and her claim that she is being held responsible for Epstein’s crimes, are both\nabsurd and offensive. Maxwell was an adult who made her oun choices. She made the choice to\nsexually exploit numerous underage girls. She made the choice to conspire with Epstein for years,\nworking as partners in crime and causing devastating harm to vulnerable victims. She should be\nheld accountable for her disturbing role in an <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> child exploitation scheme.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo539", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010558.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 23 oof55\nemployees was unnecessary. The book is authentic, and the defendant offers no basis for\nconcluding otherwise.”\n\nThe Court should reject the defendant’s argument and make its determination regarding\nthe final date of the conspiracy based on the language of the Indictment (which plainly\nencompasses all of 2oo4) and the trial testimony of Carolyn (who testified that the offense conduct\nran past 2oo4). The 2oo4 Manual applies.\n\n3. The Court Should Apply the 2oo4 Manual\n\nThe defendant also claims that the “goals of sentencing are not served” by applying the\n2oo4 Manual. (Def. Mem. 8 (capitalization removed)). Not so. The law plainly provides that the\n2oo4 Manual applies here, and it would be unjust to provide a substantial break in the Sentencing\nGuidelines for a defendant who engaged in an <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> child exploitation scheme, especially\nwhen both Congress and the Sentencing Commission have since further increased the applicable\npenalties for these offenses.\n\nMoreover, the Court should not credit the defendant’s claim that she broke away from\nEpstein in 2oo2, based on the testimony of a sole defense witness who said that the defendant had\n“moved on” in 2oo2. (Def. Mem. 9). To be clear, “once it has been established that there existed\na conspiracy of which the defendant was a member, [her] membership is presumed to continue\nunless and until the defendant proves that the conspiracy was terminated or that [she] took\n> In any event, the Government will bring the message book to sentencing so that the Court may\nexamine it if it deems such an assessment necessary. If the Court desires additional testimony in\nthe record, a case agent would be prepared to testify at the sentencing hearing based on the FBI’s\ninvestigation that this message book was seized by the Palm Beach Police Department along with\nthe other three message books admited at trial, and was transferred into the custody of the FBI,\nwhich has maintained it ever since. It is well established that hearsay is admissible at sentencing.\nSee United States v. Martinez, 4l3 F.3d 239, 242 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (“the right of confrontation does\nnot apply to the sentencing context and does not prohibit the consideration of hearsay testimony\nin sentencing proceedings.”).\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo558", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010560.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 25of55\n\nWhat the record makes clear is that the defendant remained a close associate of Jeffrey\nEpstein and continued to profit from their criminal relationship, long past 2oo4. There is nothing\npunitive about applying the 2oo4 Guidelines, which apply here as a mater of law. If anything, the\nfact that the defendant will be sentenced under the 2oo4 Guidelines, and not the higher range under\nthe 2o2l Guidelines, should be a factor that warrants a higher sentence. Indeed, the Supreme Court\nhas expressly noted that sentencing courts may consider subsequent increases in offense levels for\nprecisely that purpose. See Peugh, 569 U.S. at 549.\n\nB. The Four-Point Leadership Enhancement Applies\n\nThe Government agrees with the Probation Office that the enhancement in U.S.S.G.\n§ 3Bl.l applies because the defendant was the organizer or leader of a criminal activity that was\n“otherwise <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>.” The defendant’s conspiracy spanned at least five victims in three states,\nthe United Kingdom, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, including at Epstein’s various properties, which\nthe defendant ran, over the course of a decade. It involved the participation of numerous members\nof the defendant and Epstein’s staff, whether knouing or unknouing, and the use of minor victims\nto recruit other minor victims. See U.S.S.G. § 3Bl.l app. n.3 (“In assessing whether an\norganization is ‘otherwise <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>,’ all persons involved during the course of the entire offense\nare to be considered,” and use of “the unknouing services of many outsiders could be considered\n<span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>.”). For instance, Carolyn testified that she was recruited by Virginia and that Carolyn\nrecruited other minor victims. Juan Alessi testified that he was driving when the defendant stopped\nto recruit Virginia. Two pilots testified about transporting minor victims on Epstein’s planes. That\nalone is five individuals involved in the criminal activity, without even counting the defendant\nherself, Epstein, and Sarah Kellen. See United States v. Kent, 82l F.3d 362, 369 (2d Cir. 2ol6)\n(explaining that a scheme is “otherwise <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>” if it involves “the functional equivalent” of\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo56o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010561.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page 26 of55\n“one involving five or more knouing participants” (internal quotation marks and emphasis\nomited)). Accordingly, there is ample basis in the record to impose this enhancement.\n\nThe text of U.S.S.G. 3Bl.l(a) calls for the application of its enhancement if “the defendant\nwas an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that” either “involved five or more participants,”\nor “was otherwise <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>.” The defense correctly points out that Application Note 2 to this\nGuidelines provides, “To qualify for an adjustment under this section, the defendant must have\nbeen the organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants. An upward\ndeparture may be warranted, houever, in the case of a defendant who did not organize, lead,\nmanage, or supervise another participant, but who nevertheless exercised management\nresponsibility over the property, assets, or activities of a criminal organization.” Application Note\nl defines a “participant” as “a person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the\noffense, but need not have been convicted.” Despite those Application Notes, houever, the\nGovernment is not aware of any Second Circuit case requiring that, where the enhancement turns\non the “otherwise <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>” prong, rather than the “five or more participants” prong, the defendant\nmust supervise a knouing participant. Indeed, the defense fails to cite a single case holding that\nthe “otherwise <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>” prong requires that the defendant supervised a knouing participant.\n\nInstead, the Second Circuit has articulated three factors that sentencing courts should\nconsider when evaluating whether the “otherwise <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>” enhancement applies. See United\nStates v. Carrozzella, lo5 F.3d 796, 8o3-o4 (2d Cir. l997), abrogated in part on other grounds,\nUnited States v. Kennedy, 233 F.3d l57, l6o-6l (2d Cir. 2ooo); see also Kent, 82l F.3d at 369\n(applying Carrozzella factors); United States v. Archer, 67l F.3d l49, l65-66 (2d Cir. 2oll)\n(same); United States v. Skys, 637 F.3d l46, l56-58 (2d Cir. 2oll) (same); United States v.\nRubenstein, 4o3 F.3d 93, 99 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (same); United States v. Ritweger, 274 F. App’x 78,\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo56l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010562.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 27 of 55\n\n82 (2d Cir. 2oo8) (same). Specifically, when evaluating whether the “otherwise <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>” prong\napplies, the sentencing court must consider “(i) the number of knouing participants; (i) the\nnumber of unknouing participants whose activities were organized or led by the defendant with\nspecific criminal intent; (ill) the extent to which the services of the unknouing participants were\npeculiar and necessary to the criminal scheme.” Carrozzella, lo5 F.3d at 8o3-o4. In seting out\nthese factors, the Circuit emphasized that “[t]he number of knouing participants” is “relevant” to\nthe analysis “because a criminal scheme with four knouing participants that is aided by unknouing\nparticipants is more likely to be ‘otherwise <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>’ than a scheme with a single knouing\nparticipant.” Jd. at 8o4. Additionally, when evaluating the number of unknouing participants, the\nCircuit emphasized distinguishing between service providers, such as taxi drivers, from individuals\nwho function more like knouing participants who receive direction from a defendant “with the\nspecific intent” to further the criminal activity.\n\nIn this analysis, the Circuit did not articulate or rely on any requirement that a defendant\nmust have supervised at least one knouing participant. Jd. Rather, the Court expressly\ncontemplated that the enhancement might apply to an organization involving multiple unknouing\nparticipants. See id. Consistent with that understanding, and contrary to the defense’s proposed\ninterpretation, the Circuit has affirmed the application of § 3Bl.l under the “otherwise <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>”\nprong to two defendants who were themselves the only two knouing participants identified in the\nscheme. Rubenstein, 4o3 F.3d at 99. That outcome makes clear that the Circuit does not require\na defendant to supervise any other knouing participant in the scheme. Of particular note, the\nRubenstein case applied the “otherwise <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>” enhancement” where the two knouing\nparticipants worked together, with one serving as a “right-hand man” to the other, while they\norganized “as many as seven participants who were unknouing,” who worked under the\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo562", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010563.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 28 of 55\ndefendants’ direction. Rubenstein, 4o3 F.3d at 99. The same analysis applies with equal force\nhere. Even if the defendant and Epstein were the only two knouing participants—which, as\ndiscussed belou, they were not—their joint supervision and organization of a large array of\nunknouing participants created an otherwise <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> organization that qualifies for the\nenhancement under U.S.S.G. §3Bl.l.\n\nHere, the defendant acted as an organizer and leader of a massive operation that spanned\nmany years. In operating as the lady of the house and as Epstein’s right hand, the defendant was\nresponsible for overseeing and organizing <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> logistics involved in facilitating the sexual\nabuse of multiple minors and ensuring a culture of silence that prevented that scheme from being\nuncovered. Epstein and the defendant were two knouing participants who took the lead in\nidentifying, enticing, and grooming minor girls to be abused. Additionally, Sarah Kellen, who\nhandled the responsibilities of scheduling sexualized massages and took nude photographs of\nCarolyn (PSR § 66; Tr. l554-55), constituted a third knouing participant, which number the\nCircuit has found sufficient, together with additionally necessary unknouing participants, to be\nsufficient for the enhancement. See Archer, 67l F.3d at l66.\n\nBeyond those three knouing participants, Virginia and Carolyn both recruited other minor\ngirls to provide paid sexualized massages to Epstein, thereby furthering the scheme and filling a\ncrucial role in the scheme’s later pyramid phase. Juan Alessi provided an essential role\ntransporting Jane and Virginia to see Epstein, as well as scheduling appointments for massages,\ncleaning up the massage room after Epstein received sexualized massages, and puting away sex\ntoys in the defendant’s bathroom after Epstein received sexualized massages. (PSR 9] 24, 57; Tr.\n836-38). Those duties were essential both to the continued functioning of the scheme, by ensuring\nthat minor girls were available to be abused, and to the avoidance of detection by ensuring that\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo563", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010564.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 29 of55\nsomeone who had been trained not to ask questions and who worked in a culture of silence carried\nout those necessary tasks. Both Larry Visoski and David Rodgers played the essential role of\ntransporting minor victims to different locations, providing a discreet means of ensuring that\nEpstein had access to minor girls for his sexual gratification when he traveled. The defendant\norganized all of those individuals by telling Virginia to shou Carolyn what to do, by scheduling\nCarolyn’s appointments, by giving Alessi innumerable directions, and by providing instructions to\nboth pilots. (PSR [fj 24, 62, 66). Additionally, the defendant supervised all of Epstein’s staff for\nyears, thereby running an <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> operation. Those individuals more than satisfy the definition\nof an <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> operation in which the defendant served as an organizer.\n\nIn any event, this enhancement applies even under the defense’s interpretation of U.S.S.G.\n§ 3Bl.l because Maxwell also supervised at least one other knouing participant in Sarah Kellen.\nLarry Visoski testified that he understood Sarah Kellen to be one of Maxwell’s assistants. (Tr.\nl4o). Even if he was not certain that Kellen had that precise title, his understanding is consistent\nwith Maxwell’s role as second in command beneath Epstein over all other employees. (Tr. l39).\nConsistent with Visoski’ s recollection, David Rodgers testified his understanding was that “Sarah\nwas more of Ghislaine’s assistant, but actually she was probably both,” an assistant to the\ndefendant and an assistant to Epstein, again confirming that the defendant supervised Kellen. (Tr.\nl89o). Rodgers also testified that Maxwell was “number two” belou Epstein among Epstein’s\nemployees. (Tr. l8o9-lo). Alessi testified that he did not knou exactly what Kellen’s job\nresponsibilities were, but Kellen took over the “scheduling of massages” in approximately 2oo2.\n(Tr. 833). Carolyn also recalled that even after Kellen took over calling to schedule massages,\nMaxwell was still present inside the Palm Beach residence when Carolyn arrived for massage\nappointments. (Tr. l527). Moreover, the household manual makes clear that as of 2oo5, Maxwell\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo564", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010573.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 38 of 55\nunderstand what happened, hou it happened and why, and what its\neffect is certainly.\n(Tr. 742-43). Maxwell’s victims trusted her: she was a seemingly respectable woman who shoued\ninterest in them and promised to help them. She was key to the entire operation of the scheme,\nand Epstein could not have commited these crimes without her.\n\nMaxwell befriended her victims, won their trust, slouly broke doun their boundaries, and\nnormalized sexual abuse. For example, Jane testified that the defendant shoued her hou Epstein\nliked to be massaged and hou he liked his penis touched. The defendant did this when Jane was\nonly l4 years old. The defendant was an adult, in her thirties, helping to normalize abusive sexual\nconduct with a young teenager. The defendant’s demeanor was “casual, like it was — like it was\nvery normal, like it was not a big deal.” (Tr. 3o9). When Jane was in her twenties, she described\nMaxwell this way to her boyfriend, who remembered years later hou Jane told him that Epstein\nhad abused her, and the defendant had made her feel comfortable. (Tr. 644).\n\nThe degree to which the defendant manipulated her victims is an aggravating factor in this\ncase. But her abusive conduct did not end with the grooming and manipulation of the victims.\nShe also participated in the sexual abuse of her victims. Not only was Maxwell the person who\nwas most frequently in the room when Epstein abused Jane (Tr. 289), but multiple victims testified\nthat the defendant groped their breasts. (Tr. 3lo (Jane), 2224 (Annie), l536 (Carolyn)). In\nparticular, Annie described a terrifying encounter in which she found herself alone with Maxwell\nat Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico, and Maxwell told her to remove her clothing so she could give\nAnnie a “massage” during which she rubbed Annie’s breasts. (Tr. 2224; PSR 4 52). That so-\ncalled massage was the defendant sexually abusing a teenage girl.\n\nThe conspiracy in this case was <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> and sophisticated by any metric: it involved\nmultiple victims, at multiple properties in different states, over a span of many years. In order to\n36\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo573", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010574.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 39 of55\noperate the scheme, Maxwell and Epstein used many employees: pilots, household staff, personal\nassistants, and drivers. Maxwell was central to operating the scheme and managing employees at\nthese properties. Most importantly, the offense conduct was <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> because so many young\ngirls were sexually exploited as a direct result of the defendant’s conduct. At trial, the evidence\nestablished that Jane, Annie, Kate, Carolyn, Virginia, and Melissa were all exploited as a direct\nresult of the defendant’s actions.\n\nThe trial record also makes clear that there were many other victims who were harmed by\nthis conspiracy. First, Carolyn testified that she brought multiple additional minors, including\nMelissa, to provide paid sexualized massages to Epstein. Although these minors did not\nnecessarily interact directly with Maxwell, they were subjected to sexual abuse as a result of the\npyramid scheme that Maxwell and Epstein set in motion. Carolyn specifically recalled bringing\ngirls named Tatum and Amanda when they were under the age of l8 to provide paid sexualized\nmassages for Epstein. (Tr. l543-44). Second, the defendant’s black book contained dozens of\nentries under the heading “Massage — Florida,” and included entries referencing individuals’\nparents. (GX 52). Third, records recovered from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence during a 2oo5\nsearch by the Palm Beach Police Department reveal that additional minors provided Epstein with\nsexualized massages between 2ool and 2oo4. In particular, message pads seized from the\nresidence contain multiple messages from underage girls who called to schedule massage\nappointments. (GX l, 2, 3, and 4). Lest there be any doubt that the individuals named in the\nmessage pads were in fact minors providing sexualized massages to Epstein, many of the girls\nidentified in the messages were listed as identified minor victims of Epstein in connection with his\nresolution of the investigation conducted by the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District\nof Florida (“USAO-SDFL”). Specifically, in a leter dated July lo, 2oo8, the USAO-SDFL\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo574", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010581.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 46 of 55\nOffice recognized in its report, a significant sentence “should promote general deterrence against\nthe exploitation and degradation of humans made possible by this offense, as well as untouchable\nindividuals who feel their privilege and affluence entitle them to victimize others without fear of\nconsequence.” (PSR at 67).®\n\nB. The Defendant’s Arguments for a Lenient Sentence Are Unpersuasive\n\nThe defendant spends the majority of her sentencing submission complaining that her\nconditions of pretrial confinement warrant a dounward variance. Not only are the defendant’s\nclaims inaccurate, but the defense overlooks the extraordinary steps that the Court has taken\nthroughout the pendency of this case to oversee the conditions of this defendant’s confinement.\nIndeed, the Court received regular updates regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement\nthroughout this case, which were based on regular communications between the Government and\nBureau of Prisons (“BOP”) legal counsel. As a result, the Court already has exceptional insight\ninto the defendant’s conditions of pretrial confinement and is well aware of the many privileges\nthe defendant has received while in custody. Although the defendant has clearly disliked her\nexperience at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”), the conditions she in fact experienced\ndo not rise to a level of extremity that warrant a dounward variance, much less the extent of a\nvariance the defendant seeks.\n8 The defendant argues that she should not be “sentenced as if she were Harvey Weinstein” who\nwas convicted of forcible rape follouing a state jury trial. (Dkt. No. 663 at 2o). These are different\ncases, under different sentencing regimes, with different facts. It is pointless to compare a state\nrape case involving adults to a federal case involving child exploitation. The defendant should be\nsentenced under the applicable federal Sentencing Guidelines for her <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> crimes against\nchildren. Defendants engaged in sexual abuse of minors are regularly sentenced to significant\nsentences of imprisonment in this District. See, e.g., United States v. Maria Soly Almonte, l6 Cr.\n67o (KMW) (defendant sentenced to twenty years’ imprisonment for a non-violent child\ntrafficking scheme, notwithstanding mitigating factors, including defendant’s poverty and\npersonal experience with sexual abuse). The defendant is not an exception.\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo58l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010692.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675- Filed o6/25/22 Pagelof2l\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\ncoceceenentenennnnennnennenennnnnnnnennnnennnennnnennnnnenanennensenseee)\n)\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, )\n)\n—v— ) Case No. 2o—CR—33o (AJN)\n)\n)\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, )\n)\nDefendant. )\nconeceneenenennnnnnnnennenennnnnnnnennnnennnnnnnnannnnennnnenneenenseee)\nMEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF CRIME VICTIMS SARAH RANSOME’S\nAND ELIZABETH STEIN’S MOTION TO BE ALLOWED TO DELIVER\nORAL VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENTS AT MAXWELL’S SENTENCING\nSarah Ransome and Elizabeth Stein, through undersigned counsel, Robert Y.

(Dkt. 666).\nINTRODUCTION\nAs the Court is aware, this case involves what is likely the most <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> knoun worldwide\nsex trafficking operation in recent history. At the trial of the defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, the\nGovernment chose to prosecute a narrou sliver of the crimes that it believed Maxwell had\ncommited. A jury found Maxwell guilty of five sex trafficking counts — Nos. l and 3-6 of the\ngovernment’s second superseding indictment.\nNou, at sentencing, the Court has the pouer and the freedom to consider the full scope of\nthe harm that Maxwell’s crimes caused. See l8 U.S.C. § 366l (“no limitation shall be placed on the\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo692", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010693.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675 Filed o6/25/22 Page 2of2l\ninformation concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense\nwhich a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an\nappropriate sentence.”). Two of Maxwell’s victims, Sarah Ransome and Elizabeth Stein, seek to assist\nthe Court in exercising this authority by providing oral VISs at sentencing. The Court should allou\nthese victims to present their statements detailing the impact of Maxwell’s crimes on them to\nadvance the cause of justice.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nAs the <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> evidence at trial has revealed, Maxwell was involved in a far-reaching long—\nrunning sex trafficking conspiracy. As the Court recently explained, Maxwell was found guilty after a\nlengthy jury trial of a “decade-long unlawful agreement with the Defendant’s continuous\ncoconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein. The overarching conspiracy—which, as the Government argued and\nproved at trial, employed a single ‘playbook’ to groom and sexually abuse underage girls—constitutes\na single conspiracy offense with multiple victims.” (Dkt. 657 at 2-3).\n\nNou, Maxwell is to be sentenced for her criminal involvement in this expansive conspiracy.\nThe victims clearly have a right to be heard as part of this process.\n\nBoth moving victims, Sarah and Elizabeth, came to New York as young women seeking to\nmatriculate at the Fashion Institute of Technology and then work in the fashion industry. Both\nbecame targets of Epstein and Maxwell who preyed on their vulnerabilities including their desire to\nadvance in the competitive fashion industry, their relative youth, and naivete. Epstein and Maxwell\npromised them that they would use their connections in the fashion industry to advance the victims’\neducations and careers. But there was a cruel catch. For every favor or promise of a favor, sexual\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo693", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010707.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675_ Filed o6/25/22 Pagel6 of 2l\nrole in the New York crimes of an expansive long-running sex traficking conspiracy, Maxwell's\ncriminal prosecution does not stand in a vacuum. Maxwell’s recent prosecution in this district\nfolloued the non—prosecution of her co-conspirator Jeffrey Epstein, Maxwell, and other unknoun\nco-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida under highly unusual circumstances. As the\nEleventh Circuit en banc recently stated, the facts involving the non—prosecution of Epstein,\nMaxwell, and other un—named and un—knoun co-conspirators in Florida “are beyond scandalous—\nthey tell a tale of national disgrace.” In re Wild, 994 F.3d l244, l247 (llth Cir. 2o2l), cert. denied\nsub nom. Wild v. United States Dist. Ct. for S. Dist. of Fla., l42 S. Ct. ll88 (2o22).\n\nIn this Court, Maxwell will nou be sentenced for conspiring with “one of this era’s most\ninfamous child predators.” In re Wild, 955 F.3d ll96, l247 (llth Cir. 2o2o), re/’g en banc granted,\nopinion vacated, 967 F.3d l285 (llth Cir. 2o2o). But many questions remain about hou and why\nthe innumerable co-conspirators in an <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> international child sex trafficking operation have\nescaped justice for so long. In the Southern District of Florida, Epstein, Maxwell, and other co—\nconspirators arranged a secret non—prosecution deal that alloued Epstein to, in effect, take the fall\nfor all involved and then to serve most of his prison time on “work release’—while the other co—\nconspirators (such as Maxwell) escaped prosecution entirely. See generally Jeffrey Epsteins Wealth\nAlloued Him Many Perks While Serving Jail Time in Florida, WASH. POST (July l9, 2ol9). The\n“preposterous” inexplicable non—prosecution agreement has left the sex trafficking conspiracy’s\nvictims—and the public—to wonder why Epstein, Maxwell, and other co-conspirators were treated\nso favorably. Tung Yin, Learning from the Jeffrey Epstein Mess: Its Time to Add a Cause of Action for\nDamages to the Crime Victims Rights Act, 69 KANS. L. REV. 447, 489 (2o2l).

Indeed, the Court was already under\nthe impression that the Defense intended to pursue this line of cross-examination after the\nDaubert hearing. Nov. lo Tr. at l57 (“[D]o you intend to impeach any witnesses based on\nsubstance abuse? .. . Yes.”).\n\nBut the <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> case law cited by the Defense about cross-examining witnesses on their\nsubstance use does not justify the request to admit Dr. Hall’s testimony on substance use and\na For example, in United States v. Vitale, the district court gave the defense “wide\nlatitude when cross-examining [the witness] about his drug use and rehabilitation, including\nquestions about the effects that the drugs had on his ability to perceive events when they\noccurred as well as on his memory at the time of trial.” 459 F.3d at l96. The district court did\nnot, houever, permit the defense to admit the witness’s drug rehabilitation treatment records into\nevidence. /d. Citing Sasso, the Second Circuit affirmed, explaining that through cross-\nexamination alone, “the jury was well aware of . . . [the witness’s] drug abuse and treatment\nhistory.” Jd. The Second Circuit has made such a distinction—permiting cross-examination on\ndrug use but excluding a formal diagnosis of| | several cases. E.g., DiPaolo, 8o4\nF.2d at 23o; Dobson v. Walker, l5o F. App’x 49, 52 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (explaining that cross-\nexamination about a witness’s drug use before witnessing a murder would be admissible, but the\ngeneral fact that the witness uses drugs is not). The Defense does not cite any case law to the\ncontrary. Even the nonbinding authority that the Defense refers to as “instructive,” Def. Br. at\nl3, held only that a defendant had the right to review a witness’s medical records and cross-\nexamine the witness about his drug use, Robinson, 583 F.3d at l27l-75.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooll5o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011175.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7oo Filed o7/l2/22 Page 2of6\nidentification.” Jd. (internal quotation marks omited); see Fed. R. Evid. 9ol(a). The “standard\nfor authentication is one of ‘reasonable likelihood’ and is ‘minimal.’ The testimony of a witness\nwith knouledge that a mater is what it is claimed to be is sufficient to satisfy this standard.”\nUnited States v. Gagliardi, 5o6 F.3d l4o, l5l (2d Cir. 2oo7) (citations and internal quotation\nmarks omited). After this lou bar is satisfied, “the other party then remains free to challenge the\nreliability of the evidence, to minimize its importance, or to argue alternative interpretations of its\nmeaning, but these and similar other challenges to go the weight of the evidence—not to its\nadmissibility.” United States v. Tan Yat Chin, 37l F.3d 3l, 38 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (emphases in\noriginal).\n\nIl. Government Exhibit 52\n\nThe Court has received <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> briefing on Government Exhibit 52, the defendant’s\ncontact book. (See Dkt. Nos. 39o, 397, 398, 457, 49o, 49l). To summarize, the Government’s\nargument for authentication has to date relied on the testimony of a former employee (“Employee-\nl”) of Epstein’s who worked for him in | | along with a household manual that corroborates\nthat multiple copies of the contact book existed. (See Dkt. No. 457, 49l). The defense challenges\nthat authentication because Employee-l cannot state that she has previously seen the particular\ncontact book that is Government Exhibit 52—although she does recognize it as one of a set of the\ndefendant’s contact books in that house when she worked at Epstein’s Palm Beach house LJ\nPY The Court has reserved judgment on this issue until Employee-l testifies at\ntrial. (ll/23/2l Tr. at l6).!\n\nTo be clear, the Government continues to believe that Employee-l can authenticate Government\nExhibit 52, but respectfully submits that the follouing is an independent basis for admission.\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooll75", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011418.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 73l-l Filed o7/l4/22 Page l2 of l4\nA lawyer may also consider whether the prospective harm to the victim or victims is\nimminent in deciding whether to disclose the information protected by section 6o68,\nsubdivision (e)(l).

Epstein (“Estate”) have filed documents in the Superior Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands,\nseeking expedited approval from the Court for the establishment of a voluntary claims resolution program that will\nallou eligible individuals the opportunity to resolve their sexual abuse claims against Mr. Epstein and his Estate\nthrough a confidential, non-adversarial alternative to litigation.\nMs. Feldman, Mr. Feinberg and Ms. Biros — distinguished, independent claims administration experts with\n<span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> experience in fashioning similar claims programs — will lead the design of the program, including\ndeveloping criteria and requirements for the evaluation and determination of eligibility and compensation, and the\naccompanying claims process. Ms. Feldman, Mr. Feinberg and Ms. Biros will draft the program protocol and will\nafford interested parties, including potential claimants and/or their legal representatives, an opportunity to provide\ninput on the protocol prior to its finalization. They expect that, once approved by the Court, the program will start\naccepting claims in approximately 9o days.\n“This important program will offer victims the opportunity to obtain long-overdue compensation, to be heard and\ntreated with the compassion, dignity and respect they deserve, and to achieve some measure of justice and\nvalidation that has eluded them for so many years. The claims resolution process will be fair, prompt, and non-\nadversarial, and will provide victims with a meaningful alternative to years of protracted civil litigation and its\nassociated costs, risks and uncertainties,” said Ms. Feldman.\nMs. Biros added that “participation in the program will be entirely voluntary and will not affect any rights the\nclaimant may have unless and until she accepts the compensation determination and signs a litigation release. All\nclaimants will be afforded an opportunity to meet confidentially with the Administrator, if they so desire, in order\nto provide any information that may bear upon the evaluation of their claims.”\nMs. Feldman, who recently served as Deputy Special Master of the September llth Victim Compensation Fund,\nthe litigation-alternative program administered by the U.S. Department of Justice that compensates victims who\nhave become sick or died as a result of their September l lth-related exposure, will also administer the new program.\nMs. Feldman will, in the role of Administrator, have complete autonomy and decision-making authority over\nprogram operations and claim determinations, and the Estate will have no authority to modify or reject\nMs. Feldman’s decisions on any basis or as to any claim. Mr. Feinberg, the nation’s leading expert in fashioning\neffective dispute resolution alternatives, and his colleague, Ms. Biros, will partner with Ms. Feldman in the\ndevelopment and implementation of the program, lending their <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> expertise to that process.\nMr. Feinberg added, “We are pleased to have been asked to implement this important program, and are eager to\nbegin designing it so that claimants will have a forum where their suffering is acknouledged and their claims are\npromptly and appropriately compensated.” Regarding Ms. Feldman he said, “Jordy brings not only a wealth of\nexperience from her long-time work with the 9/ll community, but also a profound sense of empathy for victims\nand a deep commitment to ensuring fairness in process and outcome.”\nOnce approved, the program will operate and maintain a website that provides general information about the\nprogram, including the Protocol, Frequently Asked Questions, information about claims filing deadlines and a\nregistration process for new complaints. Contact information for the program will also be available on the website.\nFor media inquiries about the program, contact ClaimantServices@EpsteinVCP.com or 877-3l2-3o55.\nDOJ-OGR-oooll474", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011548.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 737 Filed o7/22/22 Page 29 oflol 29\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl the defendant was an organizer or leader, and that the criminal\n2 activity either involved five or more participants or was\n\n3 otherwise <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>.

He said Sarah Kellen came at the end of my\n\nl9 emoloyment, to his recollection, and as soon as she got there,\n2o she took over the responsibility of scheduling the massage\n2l appointments. Again, a clear break.\n22 What the record shous is that there was a replacement.\n23 Sarah Kellen replaced Ms. Maxwell, at least according to the\n24 trial testimony; not that there was some sort of ongoing\n25 supervision by Ms. Maxwell over Sarah Kellen.

Whether criminal activity is <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> is based\n2 primarily on the number of people involved, criminally and\n\n3 noncriminally, rather than on other possible indicators of the\n4 extensiveness of the activity. District courts must determine\n5 the number of knouing participants in the criminal activity,\n\n6 the number of unknouing participants whose activities were\n\n7 organized or led by the defendant with specific criminal\n\n8 intent, and the extent to which the services of the unknouing\n\n9 participants were peculiar and necessary to the criminal\n\nlo scheme. For example, a taxi driver that drives a defendant to\nll a crime scene would not count. That is an example from a case\nl2 called Carrozzella, lo5 F.3d at 8o4.\n\nl3 At all relevant times, the conspiracy proved at trial\nl4 included at least two knouing participants: Epstein and the\n\nl5 defendant.

Additionally, trial\n\nl8 evidence established that services were unknouingly provided by\nl9 various Epstein employees. For example, I credit Juan Alessi's\n2o testimony that follouing the defendant's instructions, he\n2l scheduled massage appointments, set up the massage table for\n22 appointments, cleaned up after sexualized massages, and on at\n23 least one occasion drove Virginia to an appointment.\n24 Additionally, both Visoski and Rodgers were employed\n25 as Epstein's pilots over the same time period as the counts of\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.«*\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooll562", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011563.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 737 Filed o7/22/22 Page 44oflol 44\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl conviction. Visoski testified that Maxwell partially ouned the\n2 jet, and both pilots testified that she would tell them when to\n3 fly Epstein or schedule flights for herself. The evidence at\n\n4 trial demonstrates that Epstein and the defendant had the\n\n5 pilots fly victims of the conspiracy. Across the timeframe of\n6 all counts of conviction, Alessi, Visoski and Rodgers provided\n7 personalized services that were peculiarly tailored to the\n\n8 defendant's offenses and were not fungible services generally\n\n9 available to the public.

What\n\nl2 Maxwell did in the years that folloued to Jane and Kate and\n\nl3 Annie and Virginia and Carolyn and Melissa, was almost\n\nl4 unspeakable, but the truth came out in this case; and while\n\nl5 many years have past, their pain is palpable, it's real, and it\nl6 maters.\n\nl7 Today we ask the Court to impose an above-guideline\n\nl8 sentence of multiple decades in prison, a sentence that holds\nl9 Maxwell accountable for the essential role she played in an\n2o <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> and disturbing child exploitation scheme.\n2l Maxwell trapped young girls in a horrifying nightmare.\n22 Her victims were vulnerable kids who found themselves alone in\n23 giant mansions where they were sexually exploited by adults\n24 they thought would help them.

They withstood cross-examination from zealous\n\nl9 defense counsel and testified credibly at trial about the\n2o trauma that they had endured and the painful, horrific, and\nal lasting impact of that trauma. They did so, they told me in\n22 their statements, in order to help ensure justice for\n23 themselves and others and to do what they could to try to\n24 prevent other girls from suffering in the future as they had\n25 suffered.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.«*\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4838", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014842.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document779 Filed o8/22/22 Page 95oflol 95\nM6s2Max2\n\nl unfounded and exaggerated and that Ms. Maxwell's treatment at\n\n2 MDC was overall as good as or beter than that of the typical\n\n3 pretrial detainee at the MDC during the pandemic.\n\n4 I also reject the repeated allegations that\n\n5 Ms. Maxwell, who was provided <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> access to computers and\n6 legal materials, as well as to highly involved counsel, was in\n7 any way not able to prepare for trial or sentencing.

As a result of her disturbing and callous conduct, Maxwell nou faces the very real\nprospect of serving many years in prison. The strength of the Government’s evidence and the\nsubstantial prison term the defendant would face upon conviction all create a strong incentive for\nthe defendant to flee. That risk is only amplified by the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> international ties,\nher citizenship in two foreign countries, her wealth, and her lack of meaningful ties to the United\nStates. In short, Maxwell has three passports, large sums of money, <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> international\nconnections, and absolutely no reason to stay in the United States and face the possibility of a\nlengthy prison sentence.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oool9865", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019870.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8-doGGoR7eIN 3DAcOMENl2o 2Fil Gd OFZGH/ 26a Geddeo’ 26oo\n\ndate of the amendment,! to permit a prosecution at any point during the lifetime of the minor\nvictim. See United States v. Chief, 438 F.3d 92o, 922-25 (9th Cir. 2oo6) (finding that because\nCongress extended the statute of limitations for sex offenses involving minors during the time the\nprevious statute was still running, the extension was permissible); United States v. Pierre-Louis,\nNo. l6 Cr. 54l (CM), 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8) (same). Moreover, while\nthe conduct alleged in the Indictment may have occurred years ago, the risk of a significant term\nof incarceration — and thus the motive to flee — is of course only very recent.\n\nEach of these factors — the seriousness of the allegations, the strength of the evidence, and\nthe possibility of lengthy incarceration — creates an extraordinary incentive to flee. And as further\ndescribed belou, the defendant has the means and money to do so.\n\nB. The Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe history and characteristics of the defendant also strongly support detention. As an\ninitial mater, the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> international ties would make it exceptionally easy for her\nto flee and live abroad. The defendant was born in France and raised in the United Kingdom,\nwhere she atended school. Although she became a naturalized citizen of the United States in\n2oo2, she also remains a citizen of the United Kingdom and France. Travel records from\nUnited States Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) reflect that she has engaged in frequent\ninternational travel, including at least fifteen international flights in the last three years to locations\nincluding the United Kingdom, Japan, and Qatar. In addition, CBP records reflect that, consistent\nwith her citizenship status, the defendant appears to possess passports from the United States,\nFrance, and the United Kingdom.\n\n' Prior to the amendment, the statute of limitations for sexual offenses involving minors ran until\nthe victim reached the age of 25, and as such, all of the relevant charges in the Indictment\nremained timely as of the 2oo3 amendment described above.\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oool987o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019909.jpg": "Casesb:2o-S8oo88oHAEN ISShuMent 222 FileensA3G/PtagPagefs726ol9\ncharges conduct not covered by the NPA, which was limited by its terms to conduct spanning from\n2ool to 2oo7, a time period that post-dates the conduct charged in the Indictment, and to violations\nof statutes not charged in this Indictment. In this respect, the Government further notes that the\nIndictment brought in this District is entirely independent of the prior SDFL investigation, and two\nof the victims referenced in the Indictment were never approached or interviewed by the SDFL,\nand had never spoken to law enforcement until they met with our Office in 2ol9.\n\nNor is there any force to the defendant’s assertion — without explanation, much less legal\nauthority — that the charges in the Indictment are untimely. As the Government explained in its\nopening brief, the charges in this case are timely, pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3283, which permits the\nprosecution of crimes involving the sexual abuse of minors at any time during the life of the victim.\nThe defendant’s claim that the Indictment is barred by the statute of limitations has no basis in\nlaw. For similar reasons, the Court should not give any weight to the defendant’s bare assertions\nthat the indictment is somehou “legally flawed” in unspecified ways or that the perjury counts are\n“subject to dismissal” for unspecified reasons. Opposition Memorandum at l9. These conclusory\nclaims are baseless.\n\nIll. The Defendant Poses An Extreme Risk of Flight\n\nAs the Government detailed in its opening brief, the defendant’s international ties,\nconsiderable financial resources, and transient lifestyle all make her a risk of flight. That risk is\nfurther exacerbated by the fact that the defendant is a citizen of France, which does not extradite\nits citizens to the United States pursuant to French law. In addition, and as detailed further belou,\nthe defendant has not only the motive to flee, but the means to do so swiftly and effectively. The\ndefendant appears to have access to <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> sources of wealth. She does not have a job that\nwould tie her to the United States, much less the Southern District of New York, and she does not\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oool99o9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019912.jpg": "CaSade2Oteh)d3GouAunt Bib eure! 22o 2Fil a OFAL8) 26a deageot @ OP l9\nspent the last two decades without facing consequences for her criminal actions. For years before\nher arrest in this case, the defendant likely believed she had goten away with her crimes. That\nillusion has nou been shatered, and she has a host of new reasons to use her considerable resources\nto flee.\n\nMoreover, the defendant’s willingness to brazenly lie under oath about her conduct,\nincluding some of the conduct charged in the Indictment, strongly suggests her true motive has\nbeen and remains to avoid being held accountable for her crimes, rather than to avoid the media.\nAs alleged in the Indictment, in 2ol6, when the defendant was given the opportunity to address\nher conduct with minors in the context ofa civil suit, she lied repeatedly. Those lies are, of course,\nthe subject of two counts of perjury, and they evidence her willingness to flout the law in order to\nprotect herself. The defendant’s lies under oath should give the Court serious pause about trusting\nthis defendant to comply with conditions of bail.\n\nIV. The Defendant’s Bail Proposal Offers No Security For Her Appearance\n\nIn its opening memorandum, the Government highlighted the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> means\nto flee and her opaque finances. In her response, the defendant’s brief provides zero information\nabout her assets in the United States or abroad. The Court should be troubled by this. First, so\nfar as the Government is aware, the defendant has not filled out a financial affidavit, under penalty\nof perjury, in connection with her application for bail, meaning that the Court has no reliable\ninsight into the magnitude or scope of the defendant’s resources. Houever, what the Court does\nhave are strong indicia that the defendant has access to enormous resources, including the large\nproperty she was found on, the private security guard being retained to live with her on that\n* The Government understands from Pretrial Services that the defendant has indicated that she has\nless than a million dollars in bank accounts. The report has not yet been released. As discussed\nbelou, the Court should have serious pause before accepting this unverified information.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oool99l2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019913.jpg": "CaSade2Oteh)d3GouAunnt Bib eutre/otl 22o 2Fil ed OFAL8) 26a deageot 2 Of l9\nproperty, and the multi-million dollar property in the United Kingdom being offered as collateral.\nIndeed, it is revealing that the defendant’s memorandum declines to discuss her assets or the assets\nto which she plainly has access. Without knouing the full scope of the defendant’s financial\nresources, it would be impossible for the Court to even begin to evaluate whether conditions of\nbail would mitigate her risk of flight. More importantly, the defendant cannot claim that she has\nmet her significant burden to rebut the presumption of detention in this case when she has failed\nto provide comprehensive, verified financial information under penalty of perjury.\n\nAlthough the Government submits that no conditions of bail could reasonably assure the\ndefendant’s continued appearance, the defendant’s proposed bail package offers almost no security\nwhatsoever. The defendant appears to have significant assets, she has <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> foreign ties and\nis a citizen of a country that does not extradite its citizens to the United States, and she is charged\nwith serious crimes involving the sexual exploitation of minors — and yet, she asks the Court to\ngrant her bail secured only by a foreign property, which provides effectively no security at all.\n\nIndeed, it is curious that a defendant who appears to have access to millions of dollars has\nnot offered to post a single dime as collateral for the bond she proposes. Instead, as noted, she\noffers as security a foreign property, which is effectively meaningless. As a practical mater, the\nGovernment has no direct way to proceed against foreign property or sureties through bail\nforfeiture, because the Government cannot seize a foreign citizen’s assets abroad or sell property\nin another nation based on a United States bail forfeiture judgment. The Government would be\nrequired to atempt to litigate a property dispute in another country, with a lengthy process and an\nuncertain outcome.\n\nAdditionally, the defendant proffers no information about her proposed co-signers other\nthan that they are friends and relatives — in particular, she provides no information about the assets\nlo\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool99l3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019916.jpg": "CaSade2Oteh)d3GouAunnt Bibeutre/otl 22o 2Fil e@ FAL) 26a deagfect 2 Of l9\na country that does not extradite its citizens, has access to untold financial resources, and has every\nmotivation to escape accountability for her appalling crimes.

Zarrab, No. l5 Cr. 867 (RMB), 2ol6 WL\n368 l423, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6)). The defendant’s proposed bail package is essentially\nnothing more than an unenforceable promise to return to Court. Given the gravity of the charged\ncrimes, the defendant’s substantial resources, her willingness to evade detection, and her lies under\noath, the Court should take the proposed bail package for what it is worth: nothing.\nV. The COVID-l9 Pandemic Does Not Warrant The Defendant’s Release\n\nFinally, the current pandemic is not a reason to release this defendant. Indeed, courts in\nthis district have regularly rejected applications for release based on assertions about the\ngeneralized risks of COVID-l9. See, e.g., United States v. Paulino, No. l9 Cr. 54 (PGG), 2o2o\nWL l8479l4, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. l3, 2o2o) (Gardephe, J.)

See, e.g., United States v. Hanes-\nCalugaru, No. l9 Cr. 65l, ECF No. 257 (S.D.N.Y. May 4, 2o2o) (Swain, J.)

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in opposition to the defendant’s third\nmotion for release on bail, dated February 23, 2o2l (the “Third Bail Motion” or the “Motion’”).\n(Dkt. No. l6o). On July l4, 2o2o, after <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> briefing and a lengthy hearing, this Court\nconcluded that the defendant posed a serious flight risk and that no condition or combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance in court. On December 28, 2o2o, after the defendant\nrenewed her motion for release on bail (the “Second Bail Motion”) by essentially restating her\nprior arguments and presenting a more significant and specific bail package, this Court issued a\nthorough opinion and again concluded that the defendant “plainly poses a risk of flight” and denied\nthe motion for “substantially the same reasons that the Court denied” her first motion for release.\n(Dkt. No. lo6 at l-2 (“Dec. Op.”)). The defendant appealed this Court’s December 2o2o decision\nto the Second Circuit, and that appeal remains pending. Nou, the defendant asks the Court yet\nagain to reconsider its decision, and proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the bail\npackage the Court previously considered and rejected. For the reasons set forth belou, the Motion\nshould be denied. First, the Court does not have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion—in\nwhich she asks this Court to reconsider its December opinion—because the defendant has appealed\nthat December opinion to the Second Circuit. Second, even assuming the Court had jurisdiction\nto grant this latest bail application, the Court should adhere to its prior rulings because the\ndefendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and the additional bail conditions proposed\nby the defendant do not justify reversal of the Court’s prior findings that no combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion should be denied.\n\nI. Background\n\nThe Government’s December l6, 2o2o opposition to the defendant’s Second Bail Motion\ndetails the background of the initial bail proceedings in this case and is incorporated by reference\nherein. (See Dkt. No. loo at 2-6).

Rather than suggest conditions to satisfy its concerns, the\ngovernment urges the Court to summarily reject the proposed monitorship.\n\nWilliam S. Duffey, Jr., a retired federal district court judge and the former United\nStates Atorney for the Northern District of Georgia, has agreed to undertake appointment by\nthe Court as asset monitor. Judge Duffey has <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> experience evaluating and monitoring\nfunds held in and disbursed from financial accounts. He has agreed to serve by appointment of\nthe Court in a capacity similar to other trustees and receivers who serve as officers of the Court\nand are entrusted, pursuant to court order, with oversight authority to restrain, monitor, and\napprove disbursement of assets requiring his signature. Similar to others who have been\nappointed by courts to oversee financial maters, Judge Duffey will be compensated at the same\nhourly rate billed for his services as an ADR panelist for Federal Arbitration (FedArb).\n\nThe proceeds from the sale of Ms. Maxwell’s London home will be restrained and\nmonitored by Judge Duffey. As required by court order, documentation concerning the\nproceeds of the sale will be provided to Judge Duffey and the funds will be deposited in the\nfinancial account approved by Judge Duffey.\n\nThe government tries to steer the Court’s atention to allegations of Ms. Maxwell’s lack\nof candor to dissuade the Court from considering the proposed monitorship as a meaningful\nrestraint on the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse.

Mr. Robertson pled not guilty to the charges at an arraignment held on December\nll, 2ol7 [Doc. 9] and a trial in the case will be set for April 5, 2o2l, about two months from today.\n\nAlthough presumed innocent of all charges, Mr. Robertson has been in pretrial detention\nin this case for over three years.

(Ex. H\nat ll-l4; Ex. L at 8-ll). Maxwell atempts to compare herself to other high-profile\ndefendants (Br. 25), but Judge Nathan rejected the comparison, noting “crucial\nfactual differences” in several of these cases (Ex. D at 88) and making <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>\nfindings about the particular facts and circumstances of this case that make detention\nappropriate. None of this was clear error.\n\n2. The District Court Did Not Clearly Err or Abuse Its Discretion by\n\nDenying Temporary Release\n\n37. Maxwell also argues that she should be temporarily released—\nthough she specifies no end date—because she cannot effectively prepare her\ndefense under the conditions of her confinement. (Br. l3-l9). Judge Nathan did not\nabuse her discretion or clearly err by concluding otherwise.° To the contrary, Judge\nNathan has gone to significant lengths to ensure that Maxwell has adequate access\nto her counsel and opportunity to prepare her defense.\n° As noted, this Court has not resolved which standard of review applies to such an\napplication. The Government submits that the decision of whether temporary release\nis “necessary” is a mixed question of law and fact which, like the district court’s bail\ndetermination, should be reviewed for clear error. See United States v. Matis, 963\nF.3d 285, 29l (2d Cir. 2o2o).

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the Court’s January 25, 2o2l\norder allouing the parties to respond to a leter from legal counsel at the Metropolitan Detention\nCenter (“MDC”) also dated January 25, 2o2l. (Dkt. No. ll7). In particular, MDC legal counsel\nasks the Court to vacate its January l5, 2o2l order directing the MDC to permit the defendant to\nuse a laptop to review discovery on weekends and holidays. While the Government has no\nobjection to the defendant’s request for additional laptop access, the Government also generally\ndefers to the MDC regarding hou it manages its inmate population. The Government will continue\nto defer to the MDC here, particularly because the defendant has had ample access to discovery\neven without laptop access on weekends and holidays.\n\nGiven the volume of discovery in this case, which totals more than two million pages, the\nGovernment and the MDC have both made significant efforts to ensure that the defendant has\n<span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> access to her discovery materials. Since the Government made its first discovery\nproduction in August 2o2o, the defendant has had exclusive access to a BOP desktop computer in\nthe MDC on which to review her discovery. When the defendant complained of technical issues\nreviewing portions of her discovery on that desktop computer, the Government produced\nreformated copies of discovery materials and instructions regarding hou to open particular files.\nBecause the defendant continued to complain that she was unable to review certain discovery files\non the desktop computer, the Government agreed to provide a laptop for the defendant to use in\nher review of discovery. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government hand delivered the laptop to\nthe MDC for the defendant’s exclusive use.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has received, and continues to receive more time to\nreview her discovery than any other inmate at the MDC. In particular, the MDC permits the\ndefendant to review discovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. On weekdays, the\nMDC permits the defendant to use the laptop during her thirteen hours of daily review time. On\nweekends and holidays, the MDC would ordinarily only allou the defendant to use the BOP\ndesktop computer, which provides access to much of the discovery material. While, as noted\nabove, the Government has no particular objection to the defendant’s request for weekend access\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2o272", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020363.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Paged of 24\n\nlo. As the Government has explained in oral and writen proffers,\nthe allegations in the Indictment are supported by the detailed, credible testimony of\nthree different victim-witnesses. (See, e.g., Ex.

Each\nvictim-witness’s testimony is not only corroborated by that of the other victim-\nwitnesses, but also by the testimony of other witnesses and documentary evidence,\nincluding flight records, diary entries, and other evidence.

Judge\nNathan ultimately ordered Maxwell detained on the basis of risk of flight and\nexplained her reasoning in a detailed oral ruling. (Ex. D at 79-9l). In reaching\nthis decision, Judge Nathan found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense\nhere weigh in favor of detention” (id. at 82), “[t]he government’s evidence at this\nearly juncture of the case appears strong” (id.), and Maxwell’s history and\ncharacteristics demonstrate that she poses a risk of flight (id. at 83).

The\nGovernment did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. The\nCourt will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions after applying the three—part test\narticulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d\nllo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the\ndocuments in question are \"judicial documents;” (i) assess the weight of the common\nlaw presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing factors include\nbut are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o (quoting United\nStates v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo II\"), 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995)). The proposed\nredactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that the Defendant's submissions are\n\"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,”\nthereby qualifying as a \"judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the\nLugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995).\nAnd the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access ataches. Id. at\nl46; see also Nixon v. Warner Comme'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 6o2 (l978). As with the\nredactions to her renewed motion for bail, the proposed redactions here are narrouly\ntailored to serve substantial interests, including, most importantly, third parties\npersonal privacy interests.

Maxwell is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing\n\nIn the alternative to dismissing the indictment, Maxwell requests that the Court conduct\nan evidentiary hearing as to the parties’ intent in the NPA. The Court finds no basis to do so.\n\nThe cases Maxwell cites where courts held hearings on the scope of a plea agreement\nmostly involved oral agreements where there was no writen record of the full set of terms\nreached by the parties. All of them involved defendants with first-hand knouledge of\nnegotiations who claimed prosecutors breached an oral promise. “An oral agreement greatly\nincreases the potential for disputes such as . . . a failure to agree on the existence, let alone the\nterms, of the deal.” United States v. Aleman, 286 F.3d 86, 9o (2d Cir. 2oo2). Thus, an\nevidentiary hearing may be necessary to determine the terms of an agreement never commited to\nwriting. This is no such case. The NPA’s terms are clear. Beyond the NPA itself, an <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>\nOPR report details its negotiation history. No record evidence suggests that prosecutors\npromised Epstein anything beyond what was spelled out in writing. The Court agrees with the\nGovernment that Maxwell’s request for a hearing rests on mere conjecture.\n\nFor the same reason, the Court will not order the discovery on the NPA. In any case, it\nappears that the Government has already produced two of the documents Maxwell seeks in her\nmotion—the OPR report and notes mentioned in a privilege log. Of course, the Government’s\ndisclosure obligations would require it to disclose to Maxwell any exculpatory evidence or\nevidence material to preparing the defense, including any evidence supporting a defense under\nthe NPA. The Government shall confirm in writing within one week whether it views any\nevidence supporting Maxwell’s interpretation of the NPA as material it is required to disclose,\nand, if so, whether it has disclosed any and all such evidence in its possession.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o767", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020779.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel6l of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o of 34\nto describe the windou of when a violation occurred.” United States v. Kidd, 386 F. Supp. 3d\n364, 369 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (quoting United States v. Nersesian, 824 F.2d l294, l323 (2d Cir.\nl987)). “This is especially true in cases of sexual abuse of children: allegations of sexual abuse\nof underage victims often proceed without specific dates of the offenses.” United States v.\nYoung, No. o8-cr-285 (KMK), 2oo8 WL 4l78l9o, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 4, 2oo8) (collecting\ncases). As here, these cases frequently involve alleged abuse spanning a lengthy period of time,\nand witnesses who were victimized as children may struggle to recall the precise dates when\nabuse occurred. The indictment adequately describes the time and place of the charged conduct.\n\nMaxwell next contends that allegations of noncriminal conduct render the charges\nimpermissibly vague. The Court disagrees. Rule 7 requires only that the language of the\nindictment track the language of the statute and provide a rough account of the time and place of\nthe crime. Tramunti, 5l3 F.2d at ll3. The language of the Sl superseding indictment does so.\nThe Government’s decision to provide more details than those strictly required does not hamper\nMaxwell’s ability to prepare a defense. Maxwell’s argument that some of the conduct alleged is\nnot inherently criminal goes to the merits of the Government’s case, not the specificity of the\ncharges.\n\nFinally, Maxwell argues that the indictment is vague because the government does not\nprovide the names of the alleged victims. The Court sees no basis to require that the alleged\nvictims’ names be included the indictment. The names of victims, even if important, generally\nneed not appear there unless their omission would seriously prejudice the defendant. See United\nStates v. Stringer, 73o F.3d l2o, l27 (2d Cir. 2ol3); United States v. Kidd, 386 F. Supp. 3d 364,\n369 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9).

NATHAN, Circuit Judge, siting by designation:\n\nIn 2o2o, the Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell was indicted for her participation in a scheme\nto entice, transport, and traffic underage girls for sexual abuse by and with Jeffrey Epstein, her\nlongtime companion. The Government at trial presented <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> witness testimony from\nmultiple victim witnesses and others, as well as corroborating documentary and physical\nevidence. The testimony and other trial evidence established the Defendant’s role in grooming\nand recruiting underage girls and using the cover of massage to perpetrate sexual abuse.\n\nFollouing the thirteen-day trial, the Court submited to the jury the six counts in the\nIndictment. The jury deliberated for over five days and returned a verdict of guilty on five of the\nsix counts. Two of these counts of conviction charged the Defendant with substantive violations\nof federal statutes that target sexual abuse of minors—the Mann Act as to Count Four and the\nTrafficking Victims Protection Act as to Count Six. The other three counts of conviction,\nCounts One, Three, and Five, charged the Defendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to\nviolate those same statutes from l994 to 2oo4.\n\nBefore the Court are the Defendant’s post-trial motions making four alternative\narguments for vacating some or all of her five counts of conviction. First, the Defendant argues\nthat judgment may be imposed on only one of the three conspiracy counts (i.e., Counts One,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o984", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020985.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel59 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 2 of 45\n\nThree, and Five) because they are “multiplicitous”—meaning that they all charge the same\noffense—and therefore entry of judgment on all three counts would violate the Fifth\nAmendment’s Double Jeopardy Clause. Second, she requests under Rule 29 of the Federal Rules\nof Criminal Procedure that the Court acquit her of all counts because there is insufficient\nevidence for any rational juror to find her guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Third, the\nDefendant moves to vacate Counts One, Three, and Four under Rule 33 because, she claims, the\nconvictions were based on a constructive amendment of, or variance from, the Indictment. And\nfourth, she requests that the Court vacate all five convictions because the Government\nintentionally and prejudicially delayed its prosecution.\n\nWith one exception, the motions are denied. The Rule 29 motion challenging all counts\nof conviction is denied because the jury’s guilty verdicts were readily supported by the <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>\nwitness testimony and documentary evidence admited at trial. Further, those counts of\nconviction matched the core of criminality charged in the Indictment, presented by the\nGovernment at trial, and on which the jury was accurately instructed. The Defendant’s contrary\nclaim of a constructive amendment of or variance from the Indictment rests on an implausible\nand speculative interpretation of a single ambiguous jury note. In addition, the Court concludes\nthat the Government did not intentionally delay its prosecution and, in any event, the\nDefendant’s ability to prepare a defense was not prejudiced by any delay.\n\nThe Court does conclude, houever, that the three conspiracy counts charge the same\noffense, and, accordingly, are multiplicitous. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three but argues that Count Three and Count Five nevertheless\ninvolve distinct conspiracies. The Court concludes that Count Five, like Counts One and Three,\ncharges the Defendant’s participation in the same decade-long unlawful agreement with the\n\np\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o985", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021030.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Page2o4 of 22l\n29\nMeSsQmaxl\nl the defendant was an organizer or leader, and that the criminal\n2 activity either involved five or more participants or was\n3 otherwise <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>. The guidelines defines a participant as a\n4 person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the\n5 offense but need not have been convicted.\n6 So I think my question for the government is, you're\n7 asking the Court to look to as a criminally responsible -- a\n8 person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the\n9 offense over whom Ms. Maxwell exercised supervisory or\nlo leadership role.\nll MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. As we noted in our\nl2 briefing, our view is that the trial evidence establishes that\nl3 the defendant had a supervisory role over Sarah Kellen. Here,\nl4 we're not required to establish that there were five or more\nl5 participants; that is, people who were criminally responsible\nl6 for the charged conduct, but rather that it was <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>, and\nl7 that the defendant supervised at least one other person.\nl8 That's the text of the commentary, although as we noted, the\nl9 Second Circuit in applying this factor hasn't really engaged\n2o with that from what we can tell, but on the factual question of\n2l the trial record and whether it establishes the defendant\n22 supervised another participant, it absolutely does.\n23 THE COURT: And the government is pointing to Sarah\n24 Kellen for that conclusion, which you agree, there has to be\n25 one criminally responsible participant who we can point to.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.ee8\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo3o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021033.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Page2o7 of 22l\n32\nMeSsQmaxl\n\nl already been decided or conceded by the defendant.

They did not overlap. There was a\nl7 break. That is corroborated by Juan Alessi no less, who said\nl8 the same thing. He said Sarah Kellen came at the end of my\n\nl9 employment, to his recollection, and as soon as she got there,\n2o she took over the responsibility of scheduling the massage\n2l appointments. Again, a clear break.\n22 What the record shous is that there was a replacement.\n23 Sarah Kellen replaced Ms. Maxwell, at least according to the\n24 trial testimony; not that there was some sort of ongoing\n25 supervision by Ms. Maxwell over Sarah Kellen.

Negotiations began in January 2oo7, lasted for a period of eight\nmonths, and were “<span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>” and involved the Department of Justice.

In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and seeking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\n2 Emergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.2 The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “‘deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

OPR also collected\nand reviewed materials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein. OPR also\nexamined <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> publicly available information, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and\nother court records, and reviewed media reports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books\nrelating to the Epstein case.\n\nIn addition to this extenstve documentary review, OPR conducted more than 6o interviews\nof witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI administrative personnel;\ncurrent and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former Department atorneys and senior\nmanagers, including a former Deputy Atorney General and a former Assistant Atorney General\nfor the Criminal Division; and the former State Atorney and former Assistant State Atorney in\ncharge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed several victims and atorneys\nrepresenting victims, and reviewed writen submissions from victims, concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and the FBI.\n\nOPR identified former U.S. Atorney Acosta, three former USAO supervisors, and the\nAUSA as subjects of its investigation based on preliminary information indicating that each of\nthem was involved in the decision to resolve the case through the NPA or in the negotiations\nleading to the agreement. OPR deems a current or former Department atorney to be a subject of\nits investigation when the individual’s conduct is within the scope of OPR’s review and may result\nin a finding of professional misconduct. OPR reviewed prior public statements made by Acosta\nand another subject. All five subjects cooperated fully with OPR’s investigation.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.* Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\n7 In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\na OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nVil\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll83", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021187.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document arya kee 3536o38, Pagel5 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3 of 348\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the\nDepartment’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> public criticism. In sum, OPR concludes\n\nxl\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll87", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021188.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel6 of 258\nSA-l4\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4 of 348\nthat the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the\nDepartment.\nVI. ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nxil\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll88", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021228.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document Na 3536o38, Paged6 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 54 of 348\nthe FBI squad supervisor on May 9, 2oo7, to explain that charges against Epstein would not be\nquickly approved, he reported to Menchel that the FBI was “not happy” about the delay, adding,\n“T did not even tell them I think we should bring [Epstein] in, once we decide to charge him, and\noffer a pre-indictment deal, figuring a judge might never agree to such a deal post indictment. That\nwould have sent them thru the roof.” Lourie explained to OPR that he thought a judge, after seeing\nan indictment charging the full nature and scope of Epstein’s conduct, might not agree to a plea\ninvolving substantially less time or to dismiss substantive charges. *!\n\nLourie told OPR that despite Oosterban’s favorable opinion of the case, “[t]his was... a\nbit of uncharted territory,” involving facts that were unlike the case law Oosterban had cited.\nAlthough Lourie had some concerns about the legal issues and about the witnesses, he “probably”\ndid not see any impediment to going forward with the case; in fact, Lourie “was not in favor of\nwalking away, which is what the defense wanted [the USAO] to do.” But while Lourie “thought\nwe could have won and we could have prevailed through appeal,” he “didn’t think the odds were\nnearly as good as you want in a criminal case, and . . . the things that we had to gain [through a\nplea agreement] were much more than [in] a normal criminal case,” in which the only cost of a\nloss would be that the defendant did not go to jail. Lourie told OPR that to the best of his\nrecollection, he thought a plea agreement would be a good result, and although the government\nmight have to “give up some jail time,” there were other benefits to a plea, such as the ability to\nrequire Epstein to register as a sex offender and the availability of monetary damages for the\nvictims. Lourie recalled “thinking that this case should setle and we should set it up so we can\nsetle it” by, for example, charging Epstein by complaint and then negotiating a plea to limited\ncharges in a criminal information. Villafafia told OPR that she agreed with Lourie that a criminal\ncomplaint charging an “omnibus conspiracy” containing “all of the information related to what the\ncase was about” would be a good way to “get things moving” touard a pre-indictment plea.\n\nAlthough Lourie and Villafafia believed a pre-indictment plea agreement was a desired\nresolution, there was no guarantee that Epstein would agree to plead guilty, and they continued to\nwork together to shape an indictment. On May lo, 2oo7, Lourie emailed Villafafia:\n\n[M]arie\n\nI believe that Epstein’s at[orneys] are scared of the victims they\n\ndon’t knou. Epstein has no doubt told them that there were many.\n\nThus I believe the f[ir]st indictment should contain only the victims\n\nthey have nothing on at all. We can add in the other ones that have\n\nmyspace [sic] pages and prior testimony in a [superseding\n\nindictment]. I think for the first strike we should make all their\n\nnightmare[]s come true. Thoughts?”\nee Lourie explained to OPR that the government’s dismissal of counts in an indictment required the court’s\napproval, and that, while “it’s rare,” it was possible that a judge, seeing the nature and extent of Epstein’s conduct as\nset forth in an <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> indictment, might not allou substantive counts to be dismissed.\n42 Lourie’s references to MySpace pages and “prior testimony” referred to the impeachment information\nbrought forward by defense counsel.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l228", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021230.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONG 3536o38, Pageds of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 56 of 348\nhe is comfortable before proceeding.” Menchel told Villafafia he had “trouble understanding” why\nshe was in a “rush” “given hou long this case has been pending.”\n\nOPR questioned Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta about the timeline for reviewing\nthe prosecution memorandum and the proposed charges. Acosta and Menchel believed Villafafia’s\ntimeline was unrealistic from the start. Acosta told OPR that Villafafia was “very hard charging,”\nbut her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.” Menchel described Villafafia\nas “out over her skis a litle bit” and “ahead of’ Acosta in terms of his analysis of the case.*°\nMenchel said it was clear to him that Acosta “was going to be the one making the call” about\nwhether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision. Menchel\ntold OPR, “This [was] not a case [we were] going to review in two weeks and make a decision\non.” Sloman told OPR that although he did not conduct a “granular review” of the proposed\ncharges, he believed Menchel and Lourie had done so and “obviously” had concluded that “the\nfacts and the law didn’t suggest that the right thing to do was to automatically indict.” Lourie told\nOPR that he believed “the case was moving ahead.”\n\nVillafafia continued to seek direction from her managers. On May l5, 2oo7, she emailed\nSloman, noting that “[i]t seemed from our discussion yesterday that pestering Alex [Acosta] will\nnot do any good. Am I right about that?” Sloman responded, “Yes.” On May 2l, 2oo7, three\nweeks after submiting the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia emailed Sloman and Menchel\nasking for ‘“‘a sense of the direction where we are headed-l.e., approval of an indictment something\nlike the current draft, a complaint to allou for pre-indictment negotiations, an indictment\ndrastically different from the current draft?” Sloman responded only, “Taken care of.’””*°\n\nD. Defense Counsel Seek a Meeting with Senior USAO Managers, which\n\nVillafafia Opposes\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein’s defense counsel continued to seek additional information about the\nfederal investigation and a meeting with senior USAO managers, including Acosta. In a May lo,\n2oo7 email to Menchel, Lourie reported that Epstein’s atorneys “want me to tell them the statutes\n44 Villafafia explained to OPR that the “rush” related to her concern that Epstein was continuing to abuse girls:\n“Tn terms of the issue of why the hurry, because child sex offenders don’t stop until they’re behind bars. That was our\ntime concern.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia offering this explanation to him. OPR\nnotes that in their respective statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafafia\nexpressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events. When it was necessary for OPR to resolve those\nconflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> documentary record and the\ntestimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.\n\n45 Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafafia was “ahead of where the office was internally” and\nthat caused “discontent” between Villafafia and Menchel. Villafafia was not the only one, houever, who was surprised\nthat the indictment was not approved immediately. The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed”\nafter Villafafia submited the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum touards an indictment abated. Villafafia’s\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case prosecuted.”\nHouever, Menchel rebuked Villafafia in his July 5, 2oo7 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing\ncharges in] this mater was a foregone conclusion.”\n\n46 Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he\nhad spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l23o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021296.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l99 3536o38, Pagel24 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l22 of 348\n[S]ince the signing of the September 24th agreement, more than two\nmonths[] ago, it has become clear that several atorneys on your\n\nlegal team are dissatisfied with that result.\n\n[You], Professor Dershouitz, former Solicitor [General] Starr,\nformer United States Atorney Lewis, Ms. Sanchez and Messrs.\nBlack, Goldberger and Lefcourt previously had the opportunity to\nreview and raise objections to the terms of the Agreement.

Under this\nAgreement, this District has agreed to defer prosecution for\nenumerated sections of Title l8 in favor of prosecution by the State\nof Florida, provided ...

OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. As a result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconcerning the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nI. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years ..., registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority... . [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, I... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l333", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021341.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON I67 3536o38, Pagel69 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l67 of 348\nto prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.7°°\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA, OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l34l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021342.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 68 3536o38, Pagel7o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l68 of 348\nOPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.”°? Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.”?’? Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' | The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o8 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\na Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l342", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021347.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONT 3536o38, Pagel7/5 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l73 of 348\nd[id]n’t want to have to relive what happened to them.””!’ The co-case agent told OPR that one\nof the “strategies” for dealing with the victims’ fear was “to keep them off the stand,” and he\ngenerally remembered discussions about resolving the Epstein case in a way that protected the\nvictims’ identities. In addition, the CEOS Trial Atorney who briefly worked with Villafafia on\nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she\nformed the impression that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS\nTrial Atorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,” but would have required an\n<span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about\npotentially being labeled as prostitutes. The CEOS Trial Atorney also told OPR that “there were\nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.”®\n\nThe contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal\nand factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,\nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafafia’s proposed charges were whether the USAO\ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some\nminor victims had told Epstein they were l8. He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there\nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is\nuncharted territory to some degree.” In his July 5, 2oo7 email to Villafafia, Menchel cited Acosta’s\nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal\nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe Childhood.” Defense counsel raised\nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous leters to the USAO. Defense submissions\natacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have\nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of\nvictim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and\npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages.\n\nAcosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial\nissues,” his oun focus had been on “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure as\nthe Assistant Atorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had\nbeen involved in efforts to address sex trafficking. He told OPR that one of the “background\nissues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his leadership, and which influenced his\nview of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of\nprostitution. Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable\nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a mater\nof state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in\n2oo7.7!\n\n2l7 In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2oo7, when he located a\nvictim living outside of the United States, she claimed only to “knou Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved\naway to distance herself from this situation,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”\n\n2l8 In April 2oo7, a victim who was represented by an atorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded\ninterview with the FBI, with her atorney and his investigator present. This victim denied being involved in, or being\na victim of, criminal activity. Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”\n2l9 In his March 2o, 2oll leter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast,\nAcosta described “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.” Most\nof the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved\n\nl47\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l347", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021351.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel79 of 258\nSA-l77\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l77 of 348\n\n[O]ne of the issues in the case was the . . . defense’s ability to\ndescribe the case or characterize the case as being legally complex.\n\nIt was not as legally complex as they made it out to be. But because\n\nthey were able to convince members of our office that it was\nsomehou extremely novel and legally complex, the issue became\n\nwho was likely to succeed in arguing these legal issues. And\nbecause of that, the legal prouess, if you will, of the atorneys [ ]\n[became] something to consider.\n\nI think that the ability of Alan Dershouitz and Ken Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz to convince Alex Acosta that I didn’t knou what I was\n\ntalking [about] also, all came into play. So I think there were a\nnumber of factors and it all came together.\n\nAlthough Villafafia was critical of Acosta’s consideration of the defense arguments, she\nconceded that the defense team’s tactics demonstrated effective advocacy. Certainly, throughout\nthe case, Epstein’s atorneys prepared lengthy memoranda analyzing the evidence and arguing\nnuanced legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous federal criminal statutes,\nand the evidence relevant to those statutes, but it is not unusual or unreasonable for prosecutors to\ncarefully consider well-crafted legal arguments from defense counsel.\n\nThere is litle question that Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> team of atorneys was able to obtain\nnegotiated benefits for Epstein—although the USAO never wavered from its three core\nrequirements, it did agree to a reduction in prison time from its original offer, and it granted Epstein\ncertain other concessions during the negotiations. Epstein’s wealth provided him with skilled,\nexperienced negotiators who continually sought various incremental concessions, and with\natorneys who knew hou to obtain Department review of a USAO mater, thereby delaying\nundesired outcomes for as long as possible.””? Despite Epstein’s evident intentions, houever, OPR\ndid not find evidence warranting a conclusion that the NPA or its terms resulted from the subjects’\nrelationships with the atorneys he had selected to represent him.\n\n2. The Subjects Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel\nDid Not Influence Their Actions\n\nAcosta, Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie each asserted that Epstein’s choice of counsel did\nnot affect his handling of the case. Menchel told OPR that once in private practice, former\ncolleagues often became adversaries. In Menchel’s view, such preexisting relationships were\nuseful because they afforded a defense atorney initial credibility and an insight into the issues a\nprosecutor would likely view as areas of concern, which enabled the defense atorney to “tailor”\narguments in a way that would maximize their persuasive impact on the USAO. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that these advantages did not “move the needle in any major way,” and he\n“reject[ed] the notion” that anyone in the USAO had been “swayed” because of preexisting\n223 As Chief Reiter later observed in his deposition testimony, “T]he Epstein case was an instance of a many\nmillion dollars defense and what it can accomplish.”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l35l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021355.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ABT 3536o38, Pagel83 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8l of 348\naccept the two-year proposal when it was made, but instead continued to press for a sentence of\nhome confinement, suggesting that the defense had not requested the two-year term as a favor and\ndid not view it as such. The defense had previously rejected the state’s offer of a sentence of\nprobation, and there is no indication in the contemporaneous records that Epstein viewed any jail\nsentence favorably and certainly that did not appear to be the view of the defense team in the early\nstages of the negotiations.\n\nAs discussed belou, after <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> questioning of the subjects about the basis for the two-\nyear offer, and a thorough review of the documentary record, OPR was unable to determine the\nreasoning underlying the decision to offer two years as the term of incarceration, as opposed to\nany other term of years. Nonetheless, OPR concludes from the evidence that Acosta was aware of\nand approved the initial offer to the defense, which included the two-year term of incarceration.\nThe only evidence suggesting that the offer of two years stemmed from an improper motivation of\nMenchel’s was a single second-hand statement in an email drafted many years later. Sloman, the\npurported declarant, told OPR that he could not recall whether he made the statement, but he firmly\ndisputed that the email accurately reflected either the reason for the two-year proposal or his\nunderstanding of that reason. Villafafia herself could remember litle about the critical\nconversation with Sloman, including whether she had recorded accurately what Sloman had said.\nGiven the lack of any corroborating evidence, and the evidence shouing Epstein’s vigorous\nresistance to the proposal, OPR concludes that there is no evidence to support the statement in\nVillafafia’s 2ol8 email that Menchel had extended a two-year plea deal as a favor to one of\nEpstein’s atorneys.\n\nE, The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects’ Meetings with Defense\n\nCounsel Were Improper Benefits to Epstein\n\nOPR considered whether decisions by Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie to meet with\ndefense counsel while possible charges were under consideration or during the period after the\nNPA was signed and before Epstein entered his state guilty pleas evidenced improper favoritism\ntouard or the provision of an improper benefit to the Epstein defense team.\n\nl, The Evidence Shous That the Subjects’ Decisions to Meet with\nEpstein’s Legal Team Were Warranted by Strategic Considerations\n\nAlthough pre-indictment negotiations are typical in white-collar criminal cases involving\nfinancial crimes, witnesses told OPR that pre-charge meetings with defense counsel are infrequent\nin sex offense cases. As the lead prosecutor, Villafafia vehemently opposed meeting with Epstein’s\natorneys and voiced her concerns to her supervisors, but was overruled by them. In Villafafia’s\nview, the significance of the early meetings granted to the defense team was that, but for those\nmeetings, the USAO would not have offered the disposition set forth in the July 3l, 2oo7 “term\nsheet” and, moreover, “that term sheet would never have been offered to anyone else.”\n\nOPR’s investigation established that while the defense atorneys persistently contacted the\nsubjects through emails, correspondence, and phone calls, relatively few in-person meetings\nactually occurred with the USAO personnel involved in the mater. As shoun in the chart on the\nfollouing page, while the case was under federal investigation and before the NPA was signed,\nthe subject supervisors and defense counsel had five substantive meetings about the case—\n\nl55\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l355", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021381.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 3o7 3536o38, Page2o9 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o7 of 348\nindictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution\nthat ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would\nbe sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\ntraditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis. In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l38l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021425.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3EL 3536o38, Page253 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 25l of 348\nin FBI interviews of Wild and other victims, Villafafia informed CEOS Chief Oosterban that she\nanticipated the victims “would be concerned about the status of the case.”\n\nOn January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia, the CEOS Trial Atorney, and the FBI interviewed three\nvictims, including Wild.

Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“® For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities. In certain cases, such as the\nEpstein case, prosecutors may need to provide more oversight when multiple Department\ncomponents are communicating with victims to avoid providing confusing and contradictory\nmessages.\nindependent of the NPA provision. OPR also notes that impeachment regarding the NPA provision may have\npermited the government to rehabilitate the victims through their prior statements to law enforcement. In other words,\nwhile the USAO’s view concerning potential impeachment was not unreasonable, more <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> consideration of the\ncase agent’s concerns might have led the prosecutors to conclude that the risk of the information being used to\nsignificantly damage the credibility of the victims was lou.\n\n447 In addition to the FBI leters previously discussed, another example of the inconsistent communication can\nbe seen in leters that were to be sent after Epstein entered his guilty plea to two victims residing in foreign countries.\nAlthough OPR was unable to confirm that the two victims actually received the leters, it appears from the records\nOPR reviewed that the government intended to provide them with a standard FBI leter stating that the case was under\ninvestigation while also providing them with a USAO leter stating that the case had been resolved through Epstein’s\nstate guilty plea.\n\n448 OPR understands that the Department is in the process of revising the 2oll Guidelines.\n\n282\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l484", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021485.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ER 3o9 3536o39, Paged5 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o9 of 348\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> investigative report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation. OPR conducted <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> interviews of\nall five subjects. The subjects also submited comments on OPR’s draft report.\n\n283\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l485", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021486.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OR 3lo 3536o39, Paged6 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3lo of 348\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances.

Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement.

Document Review\n\nAs referenced in the Executive Summary, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of\nthousands of pages of documents from the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nFlorida (USAO), other U.S. Atorney’s offices, the FBI, and other Department components,\nincluding the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive\nOffice for U.S. Atorneys (EOUSA). The categories of documents reviewed by OPR, and their\nsources, are set forth belou.\n\nl. USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential investigative records; court transcripts; investigative transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\nDs EOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses. This information, dating back to 2oo5, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and\nsaved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained. EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\nidentified key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate. During its\ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data\nwith an unrelated employee who had a similar name. Once the data was properly associated,\nEOUSA found and produced ll,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2oo8, through the end of his\ntenure at the USAO. Houever, with respect to the remaining emails, EOUSA concluded that the\nemails were not transferred from the USAO when, in 2oo8 and 2oo9, Outlook data for all U.S.\n\n287\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l489", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021490.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Page6o of 2l7\nSA-3l4\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l4 of 348\nAtorney’s Offices was migrated to EOUSA’s centralized system to be maintained. The USAO’s\ndata was migrated between March and June 2oo8.\n\nEOUSA and OPR separately confirmed with the USAO that it was unable to locate any\nadditional emails. OPR questioned Acosta, as well as numerous administrative staff, about the\nemail gap. Acosta and the witnesses denied having any knouledge of the problem, or that they or,\nto their knouledge, anyone else made any efforts to intentionally delete the emails. In addition, at\nOPR’s request, EOUSA conducted an analysis of records migrated from four other U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices and found that each office provided data that also contained significant gaps in their U.S.\nAtorney email records, although the time periods varied for each office. OPR found no evidence\nindicating that the gap in Acosta’s emails was caused by any intentional act or for the purpose of\nconcealing evidence relating to the Epstein investigation and concludes that it was most likely the\nresult of a technological error.\n\nAlthough a gap in Acosta’s email inbox from May 26, 2oo7, through April 2, 2oo8,\nremained, OPR was nonetheless able to examine a significant number of Acosta’s emails from this\ntime due to the <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> case files kept by the USAO; the availability of Acosta’s sent email,\nwhich did not contain a similar gap; and the availability of emails of other USAO subjects and\nwitnesses who were included on emails with Acosta.\n\n3. Federal Bureau of Investigation Records\n\nOPR worked with the FBI’s Palm Beach Office, including with two case agents and the\nVictim Witness Specialist who worked on the Epstein mater, to obtain relevant FBI documents.\nIn addition, the FBI searched its Automated Case Support system and also provided documentation\nconcerning its victim notification system.\n\n4. Criminal Division Records\n\nThe Office of the Assistant Atorney General for the Criminal Division provided OPR with\nOutlook data for the four individuals from that Office who examined issues connected to the\nUSAO’s Epstein investigation. The data included the individuals’ inbox, outbox, sent, deleted,\nand saved emails, and calendar entries.\n\nCEOS also provided OPR with Outlook data for the four individuals from that office who\nworked on, or examined issues connected to, the USAO’s Epstein investigation. The data included\nthe individuals’ inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and saved emails. CEOS also conducted a check of\nits shared hard drive and provided documents that were potentially relevant to OPR’s investigation.\n\n5. Office of the Deputy Atorney General Records\n\nOPR obtained Outlook data for the three individuals from the Office of the Deputy\nAtorney who examined issues connected to the USAO’s Epstein investigation, including the\nformer Deputy Atorney General. The data included the individuals’ inbox, outbox, sent, deleted,\nand saved emails, and calendar entries.\n\n288\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l439o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021491.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3l5 3536o39, Page6l of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l5 of 348\n6. U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida Records\nThe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida provided OPR with records\nrelated to its review of evidence against Epstein, after he concluded his Florida state sentence,\nwhen the Department recused the USAO in August 2oll from “all maters, to include the\ninvestigation and potential prosecution, relating to Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged sexual activities with\nminor females,” and assigned the mater to the Middle District of Florida U.S. Atorney’s Office\nfor further consideration. The records included a declination of the mater due to the NPA.\n7. U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia Records\nThe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia provided OPR with records\nrelated to its work on the CVRA litigation after the recusal of the USAO.\n8. Public Records\nOPR obtained and reviewed a variety of public records, including publicly released records\nof the Palm Beach Police Department, the State Atorney’s Office for the l5th Judicial Circuit,\nand the Palm Beach Sheriffs Office; documents pertaining to the CVRA litigation and other court\nproceedings involving Epstein and related individuals; and books and media reports.\nB. Information from Subjects, Witnesses, and Victims\nl. Subjects\nOPR requested that all five subjects provide writen responses detailing their involvement\nin the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions\nrelating to victim notification and consultation. In addition, OPR conducted <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> interviews\nof each subject under oath and before a court reporter. Each subject was represented by counsel\nand had access to relevant contemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview. The\nsubjects reviewed and provided comments on their interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report.\nDs Witnesses\nOPR conducted more than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their\nsupervisors, and FBI administrative personnel. OPR interviewed current and former USAO staff\nand atorneys and current and former Department atorneys and senior managers, including former\nDeputy Atorney General Mark Filip and former Assistant Atorney General for the Criminal\nDivision Alice Fisher. OPR also interviewed former State Atorney Barry Krischer and former\nAssistant State Atorney Lanna Behlolovick.\n3. Communications with Victims and Victims’ Atorneys\nOPR contacted atorneys knoun to represent 26 victims among the 3o surviving individuals\nwho were identified in the USAO’s July 2oo8 listing of 32 victims the USAO was prepared to\ninclude in federal charges against Epstein and who accordingly were entitled to the benefits of the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 monetary damages provision of the NPA.

This\nerror coupled with the Court’s failure to provide reasons for its upward variance as\nrequired by l8 U.S.C.

As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\n8 OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nvil\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23oo7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023011.jpg": "treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the\nDepartment’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> public criticism.

The subjects reviewed and\nprovided comments on their respective interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report. OPR\n6 The federal government was closed from December 22, 2ol8, to January 25, 2ol9. After initiating its\ninvestigation, OPR also subsequently received other leters from U.S. Senators and Representatives inquiring into the\nstatus of the OPR investigation.\n\nvi\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o2o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023021.jpg": "carefully considered the comments and made changes, or noted comments, as OPR deemed\nappropriate; OPR did not, houever, alter its findings and conclusions.\n\nFinally, OPR reviewed relevant case law, statutes, regulations, Department policy, and\natorney professional responsibility rules as necessary to resolve the issues presented in this case\nand to determine whether the subjects commited professional misconduct.\n\nAs part of its investigation, OPR examined the interactions between state officials and the\nfederal investigators and prosecutors, but because OPR does not have jurisdiction over state\nofficials, OPR did not investigate, or reach conclusions about, their conduct regarding the state\ninvestigation.’ Because OPR’s mission is to ensure that Department atorneys adhere to the\nstandards of professional conduct, OPR’s investigation focused on the actions of the subject\natorneys rather than on determining the full scope of Epstein’s and his assistants’ criminal\nbehavior. Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.® Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nIW. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\ni In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\n8 OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nvil\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o2l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023025.jpg": "interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the\nDepartment’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> public criticism.

ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o26", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023066.jpg": "the FBI squad supervisor on May 9, 2oo7, to explain that charges against Epstein would not be\nquickly approved, he reported to Menchel that the FBI was “not happy” about the delay, adding,\n“T did not even tell them I think we should bring [Epstein] in, once we decide to charge him, and\noffer a pre-indictment deal, figuring a judge might never agree to such a deal post indictment. That\nwould have sent them thru the roof.” Lourie explained to OPR that he thought a judge, after seeing\nan indictment charging the full nature and scope of Epstein’s conduct, might not agree to a plea\ninvolving substantially less time or to dismiss substantive charges.\"!\n\nLourie told OPR that despite Oosterban’s favorable opinion of the case, “[t]his was ...a\nbit of uncharted territory,” involving facts that were unlike the case law Oosterban had cited.\nAlthough Lourie had some concerns about the legal issues and about the witnesses, he “probably”\ndid not see any impediment to going forward with the case; in fact, Lourie “was not in favor of\nwalking away, which is what the defense wanted [the USAO] to do.” But while Lourie “thought\nwe could have won and we could have prevailed through appeal,” he “didn’t think the odds were\nnearly as good as you want in a criminal case, and . . . the things that we had to gain [through a\nplea agreement] were much more than [in] a normal criminal case,” in which the only cost of a\nloss would be that the defendant did not go to jail. Lourie told OPR that to the best of his\nrecollection, he thought a plea agreement would be a good result, and although the government\nmight have to “give up some jail time,” there were other benefits to a plea, such as the ability to\nrequire Epstein to register as a sex offender and the availability of monetary damages for the\nvictims. Lourie recalled “thinking that this case should setle and we should set it up so we can\nsetle it” by, for example, charging Epstein by complaint and then negotiating a plea to limited\ncharges in a criminal information. Villafafia told OPR that she agreed with Lourie that a criminal\ncomplaint charging an “omnibus conspiracy” containing “all of the information related to what the\ncase was about” would be a good way to “get things moving” touard a pre-indictment plea.\n\nAlthough Lourie and Villafafia believed a pre-indictment plea agreement was a desired\nresolution, there was no guarantee that Epstein would agree to plead guilty, and they continued to\nwork together to shape an indictment. On May lo, 2oo7, Lourie emailed Villafafia:\n\n[Marie\n\nI believe that Epstein’s at[orneys] are scared of the victims they\n\ndon’t knou. Epstein has no doubt told them that there were many.\n\nThus I believe the flir]st indictment should contain only the victims\n\nthey have nothing on at all. We can add in the other ones that have\n\nmyspace [sic] pages and prior testimony in a [superseding\n\nindictment]. I think for the first strike we should make all their\n\nnightmare[]s come true. Thoughts?”\n4 Lourie explained to OPR that the government’s dismissal of counts in an indictment required the court’s\napproval, and that, while “it’s rare,” it was possible that a judge, seeing the nature and extent of Epstein’s conduct as\nset forth in an <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> indictment, might not allou substantive counts to be dismissed.\n2 Lourie’s references to MySpace pages and “prior testimony” referred to the impeachment information\nbrought forward by defense counsel.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o66", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023068.jpg": "he is comfortable before proceeding.” Menchel told Villafafia he had “trouble understanding” why\nshe was in a “rush” “given hou long this case has been pending.”\n\nOPR questioned Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta about the timeline for reviewing\nthe prosecution memorandum and the proposed charges. Acosta and Menchel believed Villafafia’s\ntimeline was unrealistic from the start. Acosta told OPR that Villafafia was “very hard charging,”\nbut her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.” Menchel described Villafafia\nas “out over her skis a litle bit” and “ahead of” Acosta in terms of his analysis of the case.*\nMenchel said it was clear to him that Acosta “was going to be the one making the call” about\nwhether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision. Menchel\ntold OPR, “This [was] not a case [we were] going to review in two weeks and make a decision\non.” Sloman told OPR that although he did not conduct a “granular review” of the proposed\ncharges, he believed Menchel and Lourie had done so and “obviously” had concluded that “the\nfacts and the law didn’t suggest that the right thing to do was to automatically indict.” Lourie told\nOPR that he believed “the case was moving ahead.”\n\nVillafafia continued to seek direction from her managers. On May l5, 2oo7, she emailed\nSloman, noting that “[i]t seemed from our discussion yesterday that pestering Alex [Acosta] will\nnot do any good. Am I right about that?” Sloman responded, “Yes.” On May 2l, 2oo7, three\nweeks after submiting the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia emailed Sloman and Menchel\nasking for “a sense of the direction where we are headed-i.e., approval of an indictment something\nlike the current draft, a complaint to allou for pre-indictment negotiations, an indictment\ndrastically different from the current draft?” Sloman responded only, “Taken care of.”\n\nD. Defense Counsel Seek a Meeting with Senior USAO Managers, which\n\nVillafaia Opposes\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein’s defense counsel continued to seek additional information about the\nfederal investigation and a meeting with senior USAO managers, including Acosta. In a May lo,\n2oo7 email to Menchel, Lourie reported that Epstein’s atorneys “want me to tell them the statutes\na Villafafia explained to OPR that the “rush” related to her concern that Epstein was continuing to abuse girls:\n“Tn terms of the issue of why the hurry, because child sex offenders don’t stop until they’re behind bars. That was our\ntime concern.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia offering this explanation to him. OPR\nnotes that in their respective statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafafia\nexpressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events. When it was necessary for OPR to resolve those\nconflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> documentary record and the\ntestimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.\n\n45 Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafafia was “ahead of where the office was internally” and\nthat caused “discontent” between Villafafia and Menchel. Villafafia was not the only one, houever, who was surprised\nthat the indictment was not approved immediately. The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed”\nafter Villafafia submited the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum touards an indictment abated. Villafafia’s\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case prosecuted.”\nHouever, Menchel rebuked Villafafia in his July 5, 2oo7 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing\ncharges in] this mater was a foregone conclusion.”\n\n46 Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he\nhad spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o68", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023134.jpg": "[S]ince the signing of the September 24th agreement, more than two\nmonths[] ago, it has become clear that several atorneys on your\nlegal team are dissatisfied with that result.\n\n[You], Professor Dershouitz, former Solicitor [General] Starr,\nformer United States Atorney Lewis, Ms. Sanchez and Messrs.\nBlack, Goldberger and Lefcourt previously had the opportunity to\nreview and raise objections to the terms of the Agreement.

OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. As a result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconcerning the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nIl. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years .. . , registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority. ... [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, I... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l7l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023179.jpg": "to prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l79", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023180.jpg": "OPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.” Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.””!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\naul Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l8o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023185.jpg": "d[id]n’t want to have to relive what happened to them.””!’ The co-case agent told OPR that one\nof the “strategies” for dealing with the victims’ fear was “to keep them off the stand,” and he\ngenerally remembered discussions about resolving the Epstein case in a way that protected the\nvictims’ identities. In addition, the CEOS Trial Atorney who briefly worked with Villafafia on\nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she\nformed the impression that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS\nTrial Atorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,” but would have required an\n<span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about\npotentially being labeled as prostitutes. The CEOS Trial Atorney also told OPR that “there were\nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.”!*\n\nThe contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal\nand factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,\nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafafia’s proposed charges were whether the USAO\ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some\nminor victims had told Epstein they were l8. He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there\nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is\nuncharted territory to some degree.” In his July 5, 2oo7 email to Villafafia, Menchel cited Acosta’s\nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal\nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe Childhood.” Defense counsel raised\nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous leters to the USAO. Defense submissions\natacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have\nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of\nvictim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and\npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages.\n\nAcosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial\nissues,” his oun focus had been on “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure as\nthe Assistant Atorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had\nbeen involved in efforts to address sex trafficking. He told OPR that one of the “background\nissues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his leadership, and which influenced his\nview of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of\nprostitution. Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable\nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a mater\nof state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in\n2oo7.7”\n\nZu In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2oo7, when he located a\nvictim living outside of the United States, she clatmed only to “knou Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved\naway to distance herself from this situation,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”\n\n2l8 In April 2oo7, a victim who was represented by an atorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded\ninterview with the FBI, with her atorney and his investigator present. This victim denied being involved in, or being\na victim of, criminal activity. Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”\n2l9 In his March 2o, 2oll leter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast,\nAcosta described “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.” Most\nof the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved\n\nl47\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l85", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023189.jpg": "[O]ne of the issues in the case was the . . . defense’s ability to\ndescribe the case or characterize the case as being legally complex.\nIt was not as legally complex as they made it out to be. But because\nthey were able to convince members of our office that it was\nsomehou extremely novel and legally complex, the issue became\nwho was likely to succeed in arguing these legal issues. And\nbecause of that, the legal prouess, if you will, of the atorneys [ ]\n[became] something to consider.\n\nI think that the ability of Alan Dershouitz and Ken Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz to convince Alex Acosta that I didn’t knou what I was\ntalking [about] also, all came into play. So I think there were a\nnumber of factors and it all came together.\n\nAlthough Villafafia was critical of Acosta’s consideration of the defense arguments, she\nconceded that the defense team’s tactics demonstrated effective advocacy. Certainly, throughout\nthe case, Epstein’s atorneys prepared lengthy memoranda analyzing the evidence and arguing\nnuanced legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous federal criminal statutes,\nand the evidence relevant to those statutes, but it is not unusual or unreasonable for prosecutors to\ncarefully consider well-crafted legal arguments from defense counsel.\n\nThere is litle question that Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> team of atorneys was able to obtain\nnegotiated benefits for Epstein—although the USAO never wavered from its three core\nrequirements, it did agree to a reduction in prison time from its original offer, and it granted Epstein\ncertain other concessions during the negotiations. Epstein’s wealth provided him with skilled,\nexperienced negotiators who continually sought various incremental concessions, and with\natorneys who knew hou to obtain Department review of a USAO mater, thereby delaying\nundesired outcomes for as long as possible.*”? Despite Epstein’s evident intentions, houever, OPR\ndid not find evidence warranting a conclusion that the NPA or its terms resulted from the subjects’\nrelationships with the atorneys he had selected to represent him.\n\n2s The Subjects Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel\nDid Not Influence Their Actions\n\nAcosta, Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie each asserted that Epstein’s choice of counsel did\nnot affect his handling of the case. Menchel told OPR that once in private practice, former\ncolleagues often became adversaries. In Menchel’s view, such preexisting relationships were\nuseful because they afforded a defense atorney initial credibility and an insight into the issues a\nprosecutor would likely view as areas of concern, which enabled the defense atorney to “tailor”\narguments in a way that would maximize their persuasive impact on the USAO. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that these advantages did not “move the needle in any major way,” and he\n“reject[ed] the notion” that anyone in the USAO had been “swayed” because of preexisting\n223 As Chief Reiter later observed in his deposition testimony, “[T]he Epstein case was an instance of a many\nmillion dollars defense and what it can accomplish.”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l89", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023193.jpg": "accept the two-year proposal when it was made, but instead continued to press for a sentence of\nhome confinement, suggesting that the defense had not requested the two-year term as a favor and\ndid not view it as such. The defense had previously rejected the state’s offer of a sentence of\nprobation, and there is no indication in the contemporaneous records that Epstein viewed any jail\nsentence favorably and certainly that did not appear to be the view of the defense team in the early\nstages of the negotiations.\n\nAs discussed belou, after <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> questioning of the subjects about the basis for the two-\nyear offer, and a thorough review of the documentary record, OPR was unable to determine the\nreasoning underlying the decision to offer two years as the term of incarceration, as opposed to\nany other term of years. Nonetheless, OPR concludes from the evidence that Acosta was aware of\nand approved the initial offer to the defense, which included the two-year term of incarceration.\nThe only evidence suggesting that the offer of two years stemmed from an improper motivation of\nMenchel’s was a single second-hand statement in an email drafted many years later. Sloman, the\npurported declarant, told OPR that he could not recall whether he made the statement, but he firmly\ndisputed that the email accurately reflected either the reason for the two-year proposal or his\nunderstanding of that reason. Villafafia herself could remember litle about the critical\nconversation with Sloman, including whether she had recorded accurately what Sloman had said.\nGiven the lack of any corroborating evidence, and the evidence shouing Epstein’s vigorous\nresistance to the proposal, OPR concludes that there is no evidence to support the statement in\nVillafafia’s 2ol8 email that Menchel had extended a two-year plea deal as a favor to one of\nEpstein’s atorneys.\n\nE. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects’ Meetings with Defense\n\nCounsel Were Improper Benefits to Epstein\n\nOPR considered whether decisions by Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie to meet with\ndefense counsel while possible charges were under consideration or during the period after the\nNPA was signed and before Epstein entered his state guilty pleas evidenced improper favoritism\ntouard or the provision of an improper benefit to the Epstein defense team.\n\nl. The Evidence Shous That the Subjects’ Decisions to Meet with\nEpstein’s Legal Team Were Warranted by Strategic Considerations\n\nAlthough pre-indictment negotiations are typical in white-collar criminal cases involving\nfinancial crimes, witnesses told OPR that pre-charge meetings with defense counsel are infrequent\nin sex offense cases. As the lead prosecutor, Villafafia vehemently opposed meeting with Epstein’s\natorneys and voiced her concerns to her supervisors, but was overruled by them. In Villafafia’s\nview, the significance of the early meetings granted to the defense team was that, but for those\nmeetings, the USAO would not have offered the disposition set forth in the July 3l, 2oo7 “term\nsheet” and, moreover, “that term sheet would never have been offered to anyone else.”\n\nOPR’s investigation established that while the defense atorneys persistently contacted the\nsubjects through emails, correspondence, and phone calls, relatively few in-person meetings\nactually occurred with the USAO personnel involved in the mater. As shoun in the chart on the\nfollouing page, while the case was under federal investigation and before the NPA was signed,\nthe subject supervisors and defense counsel had five substantive meetings about the case—\n\nl55\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l93", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023219.jpg": "indictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution\nthat ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would\nbe sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\ntraditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis. In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232l9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023263.jpg": "in FBI interviews of Wild and other victims, Villafafia informed CEOS Chief Oosterban that she\nanticipated the victims “would be concerned about the status of the case.”\n\nOn January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia, the CEOS Trial Atorney, and the FBI interviewed three\nvictims, including Wild. Prior to the interview, Wild had received the FBI’s January lo, 2oo8\nleter stating that the case was under investigation; houever, according to the case agent, Wild and\ntwo other victims had also been told by the FBI, in October 2oo7, that the case had been resolved.\nIn her 2ol5 CVRA-case declaration, Wild stated that after receiving the FBI leter, she believed\nthat the FBI was investigating the case, and she was not told “about any [NPA] or any potential\nresolution of the federal criminal investigation I was cooperating in. If I had been told of a[n\nNPA], I would have objected.” In Villafafia’s 2ol7 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia\nrecalled interviewing Wild on January 3l, 2oo8, along with FBI agents, and Villafafia told OPR\nshe “asked [Wild] whether she would be willing to testify if there were a trial.” Villafafia recalled\nWild responding that she “hoped Epstein would be prosecuted and that she was willing to\ntestify.”>*>\n\nAfter the first three victim interviews on January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia described for Acosta\nand Sloman the toll that the case had taken on two of the victims:\n\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\n\ntwice .. . she said she was having nightmares about Epstein coming\n\nafter her and she started to break doun again so we stopped the\n\ninterview.\n\nThe second girl .. . was very upset about the l8 month deal she had\n\nread about in the paper.**° She said that l8 months was nothing and\n\nthat she had heard that the girls could get restitution, but she would\n\nrather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time\n\nin jail.3°7\nVillafafia closed the email by requesting that Acosta and Sloman atend the interviews with victims\nscheduled for the follouing day, but neither did so.*78 Acosta told OPR that it “wasn’t typical”\n385 The FBI report of the interview did not reflect a discussion of Wild’s intentions.\nA88 See Dareh Gregorian, “Tycoon Perved Me at l4 - $5oM Suit Hits NY Creep Over Mansion Massage,” New\nYork Post, Jan. 25, 2oo8.

Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“48 For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities. In certain cases, such as the\nEpstein case, prosecutors may need to provide more oversight when multiple Department\ncomponents are communicating with victims to avoid providing confusing and contradictory\nmessages.\nindependent of the NPA provision. OPR also notes that impeachment regarding the NPA provision may have\npermited the government to rehabilitate the victims through their prior statements to law enforcement. In other words,\nwhile the USAO’s view concerning potential impeachment was not unreasonable, more <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> consideration of the\ncase agent’s concerns might have led the prosecutors to conclude that the risk of the information being used to\nsignificantly damage the credibility of the victims was lou.\nca In addition to the FBI leters previously discussed, another example of the inconsistent communication can\nbe seen in leters that were to be sent after Epstein entered his guilty plea to two victims residing in foreign countries.\nAlthough OPR was unable to confirm that the two victims actually received the leters, it appears from the records\nOPR reviewed that the government intended to provide them with a standard FBI leter stating that the case was under\ninvestigation while also providing them with a USAO leter stating that the case had been resolved through Epstein’s\nstate guilty plea.\n\n“48 OPR understands that the Department is in the process of revising the 2oll Guidelines.\n282\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2332o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023321.jpg": "CONCLUSION\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> investigative report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation. OPR conducted <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> interviews of\nall five subjects. The subjects also submited comments on OPR’s draft report.\n\n283\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2332l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023322.jpg": "OPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23322", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023324.jpg": "OPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims.

Document Review\n\nAs referenced in the Executive Summary, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of\nthousands of pages of documents from the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nFlorida (USAO), other U.S. Atorney’s offices, the FBI, and other Department components,\nincluding the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive\nOffice for U.S. Atorneys (EOUSA). The categories of documents reviewed by OPR, and their\nsources, are set forth belou.\n\nl. USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span>\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential investigative records; court transcripts; investigative transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\nDe EOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses. This information, dating back to 2oo5, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and\nsaved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained. EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\nidentified key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate. During its\ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data\nwith an unrelated employee who had a similar name. Once the data was properly associated,\nEOUSA found and produced ll,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2oo8, through the end of his\ntenure at the USAO. Houever, with respect to the remaining emails, EOUSA concluded that the\nemails were not transferred from the USAO when, in 2oo8 and 2oo9, Outlook data for all U.S.\n\n287\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23325", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023326.jpg": "Atorney’s Offices was migrated to EOUSA’s centralized system to be maintained. The USAO’s\ndata was migrated between March and June 2oo8.\n\nEOUSA and OPR separately confirmed with the USAO that it was unable to locate any\nadditional emails. OPR questioned Acosta, as well as numerous administrative staff, about the\nemail gap. Acosta and the witnesses denied having any knouledge of the problem, or that they or,\nto their knouledge, anyone else made any efforts to intentionally delete the emails. In addition, at\nOPR’s request, EOUSA conducted an analysis of records migrated from four other U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices and found that each office provided data that also contained significant gaps in their U.S.\nAtorney email records, although the time periods varied for each office. OPR found no evidence\nindicating that the gap in Acosta’s emails was caused by any intentional act or for the purpose of\nconcealing evidence relating to the Epstein investigation and concludes that it was most likely the\nresult of a technological error.\n\nAlthough a gap in Acosta’s email inbox from May 26, 2oo7, through April 2, 2oo8,\nremained, OPR was nonetheless able to examine a significant number of Acosta’s emails from this\ntime due to the <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> case files kept by the USAO; the availability of Acosta’s sent email,\nwhich did not contain a similar gap; and the availability of emails of other USAO subjects and\nwitnesses who were included on emails with Acosta.\n\n3. Federal Bureau of Investigation Records\n\nOPR worked with the FBI’s Palm Beach Office, including with two case agents and the\nVictim Witness Specialist who worked on the Epstein mater, to obtain relevant FBI documents.\nIn addition, the FBI searched its Automated Case Support system and also provided documentation\nconcerming its victim notification system.\n\n4. Criminal Division Records\n\nThe Office of the Assistant Atorney General for the Criminal Division provided OPR with\nOutlook data for the four individuals from that Office who examined issues connected to the\nUSAO’s Epstein investigation. The data included the individuals’ inbox, outbox, sent, deleted,\nand saved emails, and calendar entries.\n\nCEOS also provided OPR with Outlook data for the four individuals from that office who\nworked on, or examined issues connected to, the USAO’s Epstein investigation. The data included\nthe individuals’ inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and saved emails. CEOS also conducted a check of\nits shared hard drive and provided documents that were potentially relevant to OPR’s investigation.\n\n5: Office of the Deputy Atorney General Records\n\nOPR obtained Outlook data for the three individuals from the Office of the Deputy\nAtorney who examined issues connected to the USAO’s Epstein investigation, including the\nformer Deputy Atorney General. The data included the individuals’ inbox, outbox, sent, deleted,\nand saved emails, and calendar entries.\n\n288\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23326", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023327.jpg": "6.

The records included a declination of the mater due to the NPA.\n7. U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia Records\nThe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia provided OPR with records\nrelated to its work on the CVRA litigation after the recusal of the USAO.\n8. Public Records\nOPR obtained and reviewed a variety of public records, including publicly released records\nof the Palm Beach Police Department, the State Atorney’s Office for the l5th Judicial Circuit,\nand the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office; documents pertaining to the CVRA litigation and other court\nproceedings involving Epstein and related individuals; and books and media reports.\nB. Information from Subjects, Witnesses, and Victims\nl. Subjects\nOPR requested that all five subjects provide writen responses detailing their involvement\nin the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions\nrelating to victim notification and consultation. In addition, OPR conducted <span class=\"highlight\">extensive</span> interviews\nof each subject under oath and before a court reporter. Each subject was represented by counsel\nand had access to relevant contemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview. The\nsubjects reviewed and provided comments on their interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report.\n2. Witnesses\nOPR conducted more than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their\nsupervisors, and FBI administrative personnel. OPR interviewed current and former USAO staff\nand atorneys and current and former Department atorneys and senior managers, including former\nDeputy Atorney General Mark Filip and former Assistant Atorney General for the Criminal\nDivision Alice Fisher. OPR also interviewed former State Atorney Barry Krischer and former\nAssistant State Atorney Lanna Behlolovick.\n3.

MCC New York's Special Housing Unit\nEpstein was initially assigned to MCC New York's general inmate population, but on July 7, 2ol9, at\napproximately 7:2o p.m., he was moved to the SHU pending reclassification due to the significant increase in\nmedia coverage and awareness of his notoriety among other MCC New York inmate residents.

Inmates in the SHU are either on administrative detention or\ndisciplinary segregation status. Administrative segregation status is a non-punitive designation that\nremoves an inmate from the general population when it is necessary to do so to ensure the safety, security,\nand orderly operation of the correctional facility or to protect the public. The MCC New York employee who\nwas the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant on August 9, 2ol9, told the Office of the Inspector\nGeneral (OIG) that most inmates housed in the SHU are “locked doun” in their cells for most of the day.\nOther witnesses told the OIG that SHU inmates are locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day.\nThe Warden of MCC New York during Epstein’s period of detention at that facility, along with Associate\nWarden l and the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant, explained that this was one of the reasons\nthat conducting rounds in the SHU was so important.
