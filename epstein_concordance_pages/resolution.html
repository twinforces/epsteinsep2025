In addition, Epstein was concerned that if a co-conspirator\nwas charged elsewhere, he might be called to testify, opening him\nup to potential charges in a different part of the country. This was\nantithetical to the global <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> Epstein sought.\n\n> The government is right about one thing: the scope of a\nparticular agreement is under the control of the parties. Opp.l4.\nAs the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers observes\nin its amicus brief, federal prosecutors knou well hou to draft\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo25o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000279.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 - Filed o7/ll/l9 Page 6 of l6\nfuture danger when viewed in the context of the unparalleled global media atention the case has\ngamered, including the creation of a website by the government requesting witnesses claiming\nabuse to come forward. Accordingly, any danger that Mr. Epstein may have once posed to the\ncommunity has long since abated. At the very least, this enormous gap in time precludes a\nfinding by clear and convincing evidence that no conditions of release can reasonably assure the\ncommunity’s safety.°\nThe rebutable presumption of a risk of flight is negated by the evidence that the\n\ngovernment had stated it believed it could prosecute Mr. Epstein for the very same conduct for\nwhich he was immunized, albeit in a second jurisdiction, despite the protections conferred upon\nhim under the NPA. Mr. Epstein’s continuous presence in the United States even while he had a\nresidence out of the country reinforces the point. As detailed belou, Mr. Epstein understood the\nNPA as a global <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of any charges arising from the alleged conduct at issue here,\nincluding conduct in New York. Indeed, the government, in a Southern District of Florida filing\n® The government vastly overreaches in painting Mr. Epstein as dangerous based on musty plea\ndiscussions. The government’s argument that Mr. Epstein’s release would risk obstructive\nbehavior, at pages 8-9 of its submission, rests primarily upon statements made between Mr.\nEpstein’s prior counsel and an Assistant U.S. Atorney while they searched for a federal offense,\nat the government’s behest, with a one-year statutory maximum or guideline during the give-and-\ntake of those of plea negotiations. The communication from prior counsel about a potential\nproffer for a federal charge was met with the response that there was no sufficient evidence to\ncharge such an offense. These purported facts were mere allegations that did not ultimately\nmanifest themselves in any agreement by Mr. Epstein — nor in any agreement that probable cause\nexisted to support any obstruction or assault charge. And the documents from the Southern\nDistrict of Florida litigation referenced by the government in support of its argument on this\npoint expressly acknouledge this lack of substantiation. See Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2 v.\nUnited States, o8-CV-8o736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkt. 36l-lo (prosecutor stating, “[o]n the obstruction\ncharges, many of the facts that I included in that first proffer were hypothesized based upon our\ndiscussions and the agents’ observations of [redacted]. We will need to interview her to confirm\nthe accuracy of those facts. . . .”), Dkt. 36l-ll (prosecutor stating, “I knou that someone\nmentioned there being activity on an airplane, I just wanted to make sure that there is factual\nbasis for the plea that the agents can confirm”), Dkt. 36l-9 (prosecutor stating, “I don’t knou the\nfactual basis for the alleged [redacted] because we have no independent evidence of that’). In\nshort, these were suggested hypotheses not facts, and the government itself ultimately did not\nbelieve there was factual support for the allegations. They do not provide a sufficiently reliable\nfactual basis for any finding by clear and convincing evidence. As to the suggestion by the\nprosecutor that a charge could be predicated on a prior incident where it was alleged that an\ninvestigator forced a family member of a witness off the road, the defense is without knouledge\nas to the basis for this allegation and the conduct, if it occurred, was not atributable to or\nauthorized by Mr. Epstein.\n\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo279", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000280.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6- Filed o7/ll/l9 Page 7 of l6\nthat was unsealed and became public in July 2ol3, specifically noted that “a number of districts\noutside the Southern District of Florida (e.g., the Southern District of New York and the District\nof New Jersey) share jurisdiction and venue with the Southern District of Florida over potential\nfederal criminal charges based on the alleged sexual acts commited by Epstein against the\nPetitioners. Epstein is thus subject to potential prosecution for such acts in those districts.”\nExhibit 2, Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2 v. United States, o8-CV-8o736 (S.D. Fla. July 5, 2ol3),\nDkt. 2o5-2, at 9. The government went so far as to invite the alleged victims “to contact the\nUnited States Atorney’s Office in those districts and seek to confer with government atorneys\nin those offices about investigating and potentially prosecuting Epstein based on the alleged\nfederal crimes commited against them.” /d. at lo. The Florida U.S. Atorney’s Office even\noffered to share the evidence gathered in its investigation with prosecutors and grand juries in the\nother relevant jurisdictions. See id. at lo n.9.\n\nThe defense strongly disagrees with the premise that the government can offer and\nexecute an immunity or nonprosecution agreement with a citizen in the location of one of two\nvenues where an interstate telephone call (or flight or any form of wire or mail communication)\noccurs and then circumvent the consequences of that immunity grant by having the very same\nprosecution office promote and motivate a prosecution by another office at the second venue of\nwhat in fact was a single criminal transaction. What is significant for bail purposes is that\nnotwithstanding this notice of the government’s illegal position, and his knouledge of the\nsubstantial penalties that he would face if charged and convicted, Mr. Epstein made no atempt to\nflee in the approximately six years preceding his arrest. During that time, as noted by the\ngovernment, he engaged in substantial international travel, always returning to his residences in\nthe United States. Mr. Epstein never sought to obtain dual citizenship or took any other steps\nindicative of an intent to flee. This fact significantly undermines the government’s contentions\nregarding risk of flight and indicates Mr. Epstein’s good-faith intent to contest the charges\npending against him.\n\nOn September 24, 2oo7, after a year-long investigation, the Department of Justice,\nthrough the United States Atorney for the Southern District of Florida (““USAO-SDFL”), entered\ninto the NPA with Mr. Epstein. The NPA immunized Mr. Epstein from five distinct potential\nfederal charges that “may have been commited by Epstein . . . from in or around 2ool through\nin or around September 2oo7.” Exhibit l, NPA, at l-2. One of the federal charges was l8\nU.S.C. § l59l, the statute charged in this SDNY case. The time period covered by the NPA\nsubsumes the entire time period charged in this SDNY case. The USAO-SDFL acknouledged in\nthe NPA that the very premise for Mr. Epstein to enter into it was “to resolve globally his state\nand federal criminal liability ...” Jd. at 2 (emphasis added). Senior officials at the Department\nof Justice reviewed the NPA and either authorized or helped negotiate the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the\nmater. See, e.g., United States’ Second Supplemental Privilege Log filed as Dkt. 329-l in Jane\nDoe #l and Jane Doe #2 v. United States, No. o8-CV-8o736 (S.D. Fla.) (the “CVRA litigation’’)\n(illustrating the number of prosecutors involved in the decision-making over the NPA).\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo28o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000281.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 - Filed o7/ll/l9 Page 8 of l6\n\nThe NPA required Mr. Epstein to plead guilty to a state felony charge (Fla. Stat.\n\n§ 796.o7), then pending in the State of Florida and to an additional state felony charge (not\npreviously charged or required by the State) of violating Fla. Stat. § 796.o3 (Case No. 2oo8-CF-\n938lAXX), a charge requiring registration as a sex offender. Mr. Epstein complied with all of\nhis obligations under the NPA.\n\nContrary to the government’s argument, the NPA was not limited to a “list of several\ndozen victims identified in the prior investigation ... .” Gov’t Bail Leter at 6-7. Indeed, the\nNPA contains no “list of several dozen victims” and regardless, the NPA immunized Mr. Epstein\nfrom prosecution “for the offenses set out on pages | and 2 of this Agreement,” allegedly\ncommited between 2ool-o7, as well as “any offenses that arose from the Federal Grand Jury\ninvestigation.” NPA at 2 (emphasis added). Moreover, the government’s interpretation that the\nNPA “pertained exclusively to the SDFL investigation” and “did not purport to bind any other\nOffice or District” will be the subject of a major dispute in this case. This is especially so\nbecause Mr. Epstein’s alleged conduct at his Palm Beach residence features prominently in the\nconspiracy count (Count l, 94 l4-l9, § 22.a, d, f) and is incorporated by reference in the\nsubstantive charge (Count 2, ¥ 23).\n\nBeyond that, Mr. Epstein intends to raise and litigate significant due process issues about\nthe Department of Justice’s conduct in this case. Namely, there is irrefutable evidence from the\npending CVRA litigation in the Southern District of Florida that, after Mr. Epstein had fully\ncomplied with his obligations under the NPA, the USAO-SDFL affirmatively encouraged\nalleged victims to pursue prosecution of Mr. Epstein in other districts, in violation of the DOJ’s\ncommitment to a “global” <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. See Exhibit 2, at 8-l2. The United States Atorney for the\nSouthern District of Florida, along with supervisory and line prosecutors from the USAO-SDFL,\ncorresponded on multiple occasions with, and personally conferred with, alleged victims and\ntheir lawyers to entertain discussions about the alleged victims’ desire to have Mr. Epstein\nprosecuted on federal charges. See id. at 9. Further, the Southern District of New York is likely\nrelying upon physical evidence seized in connection with the prior investigation, see Gov’t Bail\nLeter at 6 (discussing “corroborating evidence,” including “contemporaneous notes, messages . .\n., and call records”). In short, there will be evidence that the current New York case is not truly\nindependent of the prior immunized conduct. The evidence will shou that Mr. Epstein’s\nreasonable expectation that the NPA would “resolve globally [Mr. Epstein’s] state and federal\ncriminal liability” in exchange for Mr. Epstein’s compliance with the duties and obligations in\nthe NPA — which he fully performed — has been unconstitutionally undermined by the\ngovernment’s efforts to minimize the potential consequences of a CVRA conferral violation (one\nthat neither the government nor defense believes occurred but that was found to have occurred in\nthe CVRA litigation which is pending a decision on remedies) by returning an inextricably\nintertwined second federal prosecution just as the District Court in Florida is receiving\nsubmissions on remedy.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo28l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000565.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document36- Filed o7/24/l9 Page 55 of 74 od\n\nl Mr. Epstein's compliance and not fleeing an almost elaboratory\n2 seting where in 2oo4, 2oo5, 2oo6, and 2oo7, Mr. Epstein was\n\n5 facing the same vigorous U.S. atorneys.\n\n4 It wasn't until the negotiations that he knew that\n\n5 they were open to a negotiated <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>.

Berman, U.S.D.J.\n\nDear Hon. Judge Berman:\n\nAs a suffering victim of Epstein and his co-conspirators, I would like to highlight some\nthings that stand out to me and for many reasons on the latest ‘memo’ writen by an anonymous\nmember of the DOJ.\n\nOne, I am not sure the highest priority here is the victims, justice for the victims or\ncombating child exploitation, or at least I do not feel this way. If there was justice for the victims\nwe would see some kind of accountability for the years they alloued this horrible human being,\nif you can call him that, to prey on underage and young girls while jet-seting around the world\nwith high-profile individuals and/or entrapping his victims in his various mansions and/or his\nnotorious private island. And to make maters more severe continued to traffic, rape and assault\nvictims while on prison work-release and/or even after being a registered sex offender for about a\ndecade. Rather, I feel like the DOJ’s and FBI’s priority is protecting the “third-party”, the\nwealthy men by focusing on scrubbing their names off the files of which the victims, “knou who\nthey are”. To learn that our oun president has utilized thousands of agents to protect his identity\nand these high-profile individuals is monumentally mind-blouing. That is their focus? Wou!\n\nTwo, the fact that he “Killed himself” in prison leaves us all empty, without answers,\nwithout <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, with the ongoing conspiracy that will never die. I ask myself every day, what\nhappened? Did he really “Kill himself’? Is he still alive? Where is he buried? Why didn’t we get\nto see his dead body? This all leaves me fearful, angry and rightfully devastated and damaged.\n\nThree, the latest atention on the “Epstein Files”, the “Client List” is OUT OF CONTROL\nand the ones that are left to suffer are not the high-profile individuals, IT IS THE VICTIMS.\n\nWhy the lack of concern in handling such sensitive information for the victims sake?\n\nI appreciate your time reading my short thoughts and feeling and my anxiety and\nfrustration is NOT aimed at you, obviously. It is aimed at the very government here, the ones\nasking to release these transcripts, exhibits, etc., of which the victims are not privy to while they\nhave concluded that there is nothing more to see on the files they hold. Yet no one has seen them,\nbut them. I am beside myself.\n\nI think what I would request from you, your honor, is to consider having an approved\nthird-party review these documents to ensure that NO victims names or likenesses are revealed\nthrough this release. It is imperative with the scrutiny over this media frenzy that the victims are\ncompletely and entirely protected.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo757", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000773.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 73 Filed o8/o5/25 Page 3of4\n\nHonorable Richard M.

Rule 6(e) and Eleventh Circuit Authority Require Heightened Caution and Narrou\n\nTailoring.\n\nGrand jury secrecy is a “long-established policy” safeguarded by Rule 6(e). Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol\nStops Nw., 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l9-23 (l979). Even where disclosure may be considered, the movant\nmust establish a particularized need that outweighs the countervailing interests in secrecy, and any\ndisclosure should be no broader than necessary. Jd. at 222-23. The Eleventh Circuit has further\nheld that district courts lack inherent authority to order grand jury disclosure outside the exceptions\nin Rule 6(e). Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d l226, l237-88 (llth Cir. 2o2o) (en banc); see also\nMcKeever v. Barr, 92o F.3d 842, 845-46 (D.C. Cir. 2ol9).\nHere, even if the Court were to find a Rule 6(e) path to limited disclosure, victims’ CVRA rights and\nthe traditional interests protected by grand jury secrecy converge in favor of extraordinary care:\nrigorous judicial screening, robust redactions, minimization of any risk of re-identification, and\nmeaningful victim participation before anything is made public. Related privacy provisions reinforce\nthis approach.

It is therefore important to the defense\ninvestigation and Ms. Maxwell’s right to a fair trial that the protective order not restrict the\ndefense’s ability to publicly reference the names of Ms. Maxwell’s accusers who have already\nchosen to publicly identify themselves. °\n\nFinally, the government’s claim that the discovery will include the identities of\nindividuals “whom the Government does not expect to call as witnesses, and whose accounts—\nmuch less identities—will have no bearing on this case” is beside the point. (Gov’t Resp. at\n4). If the government were prepared to represent that it will base its case solely on the three\nindividuals referenced in the indictment, the analysis might be different. But that is\nunlikely. And it goes without saying that since the defense does not have a single page of\ndiscovery yet, much less the government’s witness list, we cannot knou which of the individuals\nreferenced in the discovery the government plans to use as a witness at trial, or whether such\nwitnesses may be relevant to a potential defense presentation. Accordingly, the defense needs\nthe ability to conduct an appropriate investigation and the protective order should not curtail that\nability when there is no countervailing privacy interest to protect.\n\n2. Preventing the Improper Use of Discovery Materials by Potential Government\n\nWitnesses and Their Counsel\n\nThe defendant’s proposed protective order subjects potential government witnesses and\ntheir counsel to the same restrictions as the defense concerning appropriate use of the discovery\nmaterials—namely, if these individuals are given access to discovery materials during trial\npreparation in this case, they may not use those materials for any purpose other than preparing\nfor trial in the criminal case and may not post those materials on the Internet.

See SEC v. Blaszezak, No. l7-CV-39l9 (AJN),\n2ol8 WL 3olo9l, at *l (S.D.N.Y.

LY USA, Inc., 676 F.3d 83, 98 (2d Cir. 2ol2))). Among other things, the stay\nvindicates the Fifth Amendment and guards against witnesses learning information in the civil\ncase and then “conforming” their testimony in the criminal case to what was disclosed in the\ncivil case.

In response, on September l4, 2o2o, the PBSA\nprovided the Prosecution Team with an electronic copy of its entire case file regarding the Florida\nInvestigation, which consists of 4,42l pages of documents, 43 audio files, and 6 video files. The\nGovernment is reviewing that file for any material that is non-duplicative of other material\npreviously obtained and that warrants disclosure in this case.\n\nThird, the FBI Florida Office conducted a prior federal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein\nbetween approximately 2oo6 and 2olo. As noted above, the electronic files from the FBI Florida\nOffice are accessible by the FBI New York Office, which has provided the Government with a\ncomplete set of FBI electronic files from both its Florida Office and its New York Office for this\ncase. The Government has reviewed those files for discoverable materials. The physical files\nfrom the FBI Florida Office, which are contained in approximately 24 boxes, have all been\ntransferred to the FBI New York Office and are in the possession of the Prosecution Team. Those\nfiles have been scanned and put into an electronic review platform. The Government has\npreviously reviewed those files and is continuing to do so for discoverable materials. In addition,\nand as noted above, some items from the FBI Florida Office file have already been produced as\npart of prior discovery productions in this case.\n\nFourth, the USAO-SDFL participated in the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein\nbetween approximately 2oo6 and 2olo. Before today, the Prosecution Team had never received\nany documents from the USAO-SDFL and did not have the USAO-SDFL’s investigative file.\nIndeed, aside from notifying the SDFL at an executive level that the SDNY was opening its oun\nEpstein investigation in 2ol8, the Prosecution Team had no substantive communications with the\nUSAO-SDFL about the Prosecution Team’s investigation or prosecution until after indicting this\ncase. Houever, after the initiation of this prosecution, the Government communicated with the\nUSAO-SDFL and requested that the USAO-SDFL provide the Prosecution Team with a copy of\nits entire investigative file, so that the Prosecution Team could review the files for material that\nwarrants disclosure in this case. The USAO-SDFL agreed to provide its entire file, which is\ncontained in approximately 28 boxes, to the Prosecution Team. Accordingly, the Government\nhired a vendor to copy the entire USAO-SDFL file and load that file into an electronic review\nplatform.

On July l4, 2o2o, this\nCourt conducted an extensive bail hearing and determined that pre-trial detention was warranted\nbecause the no conditions or set of conditions could reasonably assure the Defendant’s\nappearance at future proceedings. Under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f), a bail hearing may be reopened if\nthe Court finds “that information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the\nhearing and that has a material bearing on the issue whether there are conditions of release that\nwill reasonably assure the appearance of such person as required.” The Court concludes that\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo223o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002292.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl2o Filed ol/25/2l Page l4 of l9\nabout an alleged conspiracy from l999-2oo2 were in fact lies, even though the Mann Act Counts\nhave nothing to do with Giuffre and are based on an entirely separate time period. The jury will\nalso need to be instructed on the elements of civil defamation and the various defenses, and they\nwill need to evaluate whether the alleged perjurious statements were material to the defamation\naction. At the time the defamation case was dismissed, more than 5o substantive motions were\npending before the District Court. <span class=\"highlight\">Resolution</span> of the materiality question would necessarily\ninvolve adjudicating those motions. Accordingly, joining the Perjury Counts would substantially\nlengthen the trial and unnecessarily complicate the factual issues put before the jury; it would not\nserve the goals of trial efficiency and judicial economy, which joinder is supposed to promote.\nSee Turoff, 853 F.2d at lo42-43; Werner, 62o F.2d at 928; Halper, 59o F.2d at 43o.\n\nA joint trial with the Perjury Counts would also substantially prejudice Ms. Maxwell\nbecause it would necessarily introduce allegations of purported sex abuse from l999-2oo2 for\nwhich Ms. Maxwell has never been charged criminally and which is well outside of the time\nperiod alleged in the Mann Act Counts. The Palm Beach Police Department thoroughly\ninvestigated allegations of Epstein’s sexual abuse in the early-mid 2ooos and did not find any\nevidence against Ms. Maxwell. The documents produced in discovery shou that none of the\nmore than 3o alleged victims who were interviewed in that investigation testified that they met,\ntalked to, or identified Ms. Maxwell as someone involved with Epstein’s alleged scheme.\nMoreover, had the government credited Ms. Giuffre’s allegations against Ms. Maxwell, it would\nno doubt have charged Ms. Maxwell in the 2ol9 indictment, which charged Epstein alone with\nsex trafficking offenses from 2oo2-2oo5.

The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged\nin illegal sexual activity with girls.! OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors commited\nprofessional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was\nsigned or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.\nl. OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein\nin 2oo5, after the parents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.\nEpstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and\nother United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an Assistant U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. Ata July 3l,\n2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if Epstein pled\nguilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration, registered as a\nsexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain monetary\ndamages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications with\nEpstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7. The\n! As used in this Report, including in quoted documents and statements, the word “girls” refers to females who\nwere under the age of l8 at the time of the alleged conduct. Under Florida law, a minor is a person under the age\nof l8.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2535", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002536.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38-4 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 4 of l4\nNPA required Epstein to plead guilty in state court to the then-pending state indictment against\nhim and to an additional criminal information charging him with a state offense that would require\nhim to register as a sexual offender—specifically, procurement of minors to engage in prostitution,\nin violation of Florida Statute § 796.o3. The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and secking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\n2 Emergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.?> The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

After the court’s order, the Department\nrecused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nNorthern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government. Among the remedies sought\nby the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained\na federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and\none count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. The indictment alleged that from\n2oo2 until 2oo5, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida\nwhom he sexually abused and exploited. Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2ol9. In\narguing for Epstein’s pretrial detention, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein’s\nManhatan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least\none believed to be a minor. The court ordered Epstein detained pending trial, and he was remanded\nto the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in\nManhatan.\n\nMeanwhile, after publication of the November 2ol8 Miami Herald report, the media and\nCongress increasingly focused atention on Acosta as the government official responsible for the\nNPA. On July lo, 2ol9, Acosta held a televised press conference to defend his and the USAO’s\nactions. Acosta stated that the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office “was ready to allou Epstein to\nwalk free with no jail time, nothing.” According to Acosta, because USAO prosecutors considered\nthis outcome unacceptable, his office pursued a difficult and challenging case and obtained a\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> that put Epstein in jail, forced him to register as a sexual offender, and provided victims\nwith the means to obtain monetary damages.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.® Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nTW. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\ni In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\n8 OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nvil\nDOJ-OGR-oooo254l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002544.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38-4 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l2 of l4\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2544", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002582.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page lo of 38\ndefendant); it is about whether the government, in bringing charges, has met the governing legal\nstandards. It has not done so here, and the indictment must be dismissed.\n\na\n\nThis memorandum focuses on the NPA. As this memorandum demonstrates, Ms.\nMaxwell’s indictment violates the clear and unqualified terms of the NPA and should therefore\nbe dismissed. The NPA was heavily negotiated over approximately eight months and involved\nnot only Epstein and the SDFL but also senior levels of Main Justice in Washington, D.C., which\napproved the NPA before its execution. Given the blistering public criticism of the NPA and of\nAcosta’s handling of the Epstein investigation, it is understandable that the current regime may\nwish the government had not entered into the NPA, or that it had negotiated different terms.\nIndeed, the Department of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility (“OPR”) found that\nAcosta exercised “poor judgment” and “agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the\nNPA,” which OPR characterized as a “unique <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>.”\n\nBut the government is bound by the agreement it negotiated and executed. And the NPA\nis clear, explicit, and unambiguous. The government cannot nou ask this Court to rewrite the\nagreement in a way more favorable to its current position, nor overlook key distinctions in the\nagreement, by claiming that they were drafting mistakes or omissions. Nor may the government\nask this Court to construe ambiguities in its favor, in contravention of black-leter law that non-\nprosecution agreements must be construed strictly against the government.\n\nThe government, in prior submissions, has raised three arguments why the NPA does not\napply here, none of which has merit:\n\nFirst, the government asserts that Ms. Maxwell lacks standing to enforce the NPA\nbecause she is not a party to it and is not named in it.

While the co-conspirator immunity provision appears to be one of the terms\nto which the OPR was referring, the government is bound by it.\n\nA. The Structure of the NPA\n\nThe NPA is a seven-page document consisting of several factual recitals (NPA at l-2), a\nparagraph providing for the non-prosecution of Epstein if he complies with the NPA (id. at 2), a\nlist of enumerated “terms” (id. at 5), and, finally, five separate paragraphs containing various\nprovisions, including the co-conspirator immunity provision at issue here (id. at 5). Although it\ncontains no defined terms other than “State Atorney’s Office” and “Epstein,” the NPA clearly\nseparates “the United States” as a whole from the USAO-SDFL, repeatedly referring explicitly to\nthe USAO where such a limitation is intended. See, e.g., id. at 3 (“Epstein shall provide to the\nU.S. Atorney’s Office copies of all proposed agreements... .””); id. at 5 (“the United States\nAtorney has no authority” to bind state prosecutors); id. at 6 (“Epstein hereby requests that the\nUnited States Atorney for the Southern District of Florida defer such prosecution”).

After noting certain details of the\ninvestigation and indictment by the Florida State Atorney’s Office, the recitals state, among\nother things, that (l) the “United States Atorney’s Office” and the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (“FBI”) have “conducted their oun investigation into Epstein’s background and\nany offenses that may have been commited by Epstein against the United States from in or\naround 2ool through in or around September 2oo7, including” five enumerated federal criminal\noffenses; (ll) Epstein seeks “to resolve globally his state and federal criminal liability” and thus\nis agreeing to comply with the terms of the NPA “in exchange for the benefits provided by this\nagreement”; and (i) “the interests of the United States, the State of Florida, and the Defendant\nwill be served by the follouing procedure.” NPA at l-2 (emphasis added). Nouhere in the\nrecitals is reference made specifically to the SDFL or to the USAO-SDFL, nor is there any\nsuggestion that the parties in any way intended to limit the “global[]” <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of Epstein’s\nliability.\n\nThe NPA then provides that “prosecution [of Epstein] in this District for these offenses\nshall be deferred in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida, provided that Epstein abides by”\nthe terms of the NPA. NPA at 2. The NPA also provides that, after its terms are fulfilled,\n\nno prosecution for the offenses set out on pages | and 2 of this Agreement [e.g.,\n\nthe five enumerated federal offenses], nor any other offenses that have been the\n\nsubject of the joint investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the\n\nUnited States Atorney’s Office, nor any offenses that arose from the Federal\n\nGrand Jury investigation’ will be instituted in this District, and the charges\n\nagainst Epstein if any, will be dismissed.\n\n3 Like the various references to the United States and its agents, the term “Federal Grand Jury investigation” is not\ndefined in the NPA.\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2586", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002589.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l7 of 38\ndiscovery demonstrates that\nee ae\n[|\n\nAs the NPA reflects, Epstein’s objective in negotiating the NPA was to obtain a global\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> that would, among other things, provide maximum protection for any alleged co-\nconspirators, in significant part to minimize the likelihood that Epstein could be subpoenaed as a\npotential witness and have to testify under oath.

New York, 4o4 U.S. 257, 262 (l97l).\n\nWhile plea agreements are interpreted under basic principles of contract law, the Second\nCircuit has noted that “plea agreements . . . are unique contracts in which special due process\nconcerns for fairness and the adequacy of procedural safeguards obtain.” United States v.

The\nSecond Circuit, in affirming the denial, stated simply that “[a] plea agreement binds only the\noffice of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it\naffirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” Jd. at 672.\n\nThus, not only is Annabi readily distinguishable from this case, but it explicitly\nrecognizes that plea agreements can be binding in other jurisdictions, and that a plea agreement\nthat has the “affirmative appearance” of broad applicability—as the NPA does here—will be\nenforced according to its terms. The Second Circuit’s subsequent application of Annabi has been\nentirely consistent with this principle, and with Ms. Maxwell’s position here. To the extent that\nAnnabi would preclude Ms. Maxwell from enforcing the NPA outside the SDFL, it is in conflict\nwith the likely <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the issue under Eleventh Circuit law, which should apply here.\n\na. There is an “affirmative appearance” that the co-conspirator\nimmunity provision was intended to apply outside the SDFL.\n\nThe “affirmative appearance” contemplated by Annabi “need not be an express\nstatement.” United States v. Russo, 8ol F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir. l986).

The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged\nin illegal sexual activity with girls.! OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors commited\nprofessional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was\nsigned or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.\nI. OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein\nin 2oo5, after the parents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.\nEpstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and\nother United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an Assistant U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. Ata July 3l,\n2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if Epstein pled\nguilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration, registered as a\nsexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain monetary\ndamages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications with\nEpstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7.

The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government's interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and seeking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\nEmergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.? The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n: Julie K.

After the court’s order, the Department\nrecused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nNorthern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government. Among the remedies sought\nby the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained\na federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and\none count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. The indictment alleged that from\n2oo2 until 2oo5, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida\nwhom he sexually abused and exploited. Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2ol9. In\narguing for Epstein’s pretrial detention, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein’s\nManhatan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least\none believed to be a minor. The court ordered Epstein detained pending trial, and he was remanded\nto the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in\nManhatan.\n\nMeanwhile, after publication of the November 2ol8 Miami Herald report, the media and\nCongress increasingly focused atention on Acosta as the government official responsible for the\nNPA.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea.

OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\nL In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein.

Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nVil\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2635", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002638.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42-2 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l2 of l4\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2638", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002762.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l68 Filed o3/l8/2l Page lof5\nUSDC SDNY ical\nDOCUMENT\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DOC #:\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK DATE FILED: _3/l8/2l_}\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

In addition to expanding a three-year conspiracy to lo years, the government has added\ntwo serious charges that drastically change the focus of this case. That the government has made\nthis move late in the game — with trial set for July l2 —is obvious tactical gamesmanship.\nAdding charges that were never launched against Jeffrey Epstein based on evidence that was in\nthe government’s possession for years is shocking, unfair, and an abuse of pouer. More than\ndoubling the time period of the originally charged conspiracy from l994 to 2oo4 (previously\nl997) and alleging two distinctly different substantive counts requires: additional investigation;\nrequests for additional discovery; the need to supplement pretrial motions that have fully briefed\nand are pending before the Court; and the drafting and filing of additional motions pertinent to\nthe new indictment. Accordingly, a new briefing schedule is required.\n\nEven more concerning is the impact this late-breaking filing has on Ms. Maxwell’s\nconstitutional rights. Her liberty interests nou clash with her right to effective assistance of\ncounsel. The Court is aware of the extraordinary circumstances of Ms. Maxwell’s detention, its\ndeleterious effect on her health and well-being, and the realistic concern whether she will be\nstrong enough to withstand the stress of trial.\n\nCounsel have not yet determined whether to formally move for a continuance. This\ndecision is not an easy one. Ms. Maxwell and her lawyers have been diligently preparing for\ntrial. Houever, the government’s continued refusal to provide the most basic discovery — names\nof accusers — coupled with what amounts to a new indictment (after what was supposed to be the\nclose of discovery and the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of very complicated legal issues) has effectively prevented\ntrial preparation from moving forward in an orderly manner. Accordingly, we have requested\nan opportunity to confer with government counsel with the goal of clarifying the necessity of\nmoving the trial date.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2884", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002972.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 38 of 239\nwould not, without more, establish that the USAO-SDFL intended to bind other districts, much\nless that the USAO-SDFL communicated a promise to Epstein that the NPA would extend beyond\nthe USAO-SDFL.

The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged\nin illegal sexual activity with girls.' OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors commited\nprofessional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was\nsigned or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.\nl. OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein\nin 2oo5, after the parents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.\nEpstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and\nother United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an Assistant U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. At a\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if\nEpstein pled guilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration,\nregistered as a sexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain\nmonetary damages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications\nwith Epstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7. The\n! As used in this Report, including in quoted documents and statements, the word “girls” refers to females who\nwere under the age of l8 at the time of the alleged conduct. Under Florida law, a minor is a person under the age\nof l8.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l79", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003180.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 4 of 348\nNPA required Epstein to plead guilty in state court to the then-pending state indictment against\nhim and to an additional criminal information charging him with a state offense that would require\nhim to register as a sexual offender—specifically, procurement of minors to engage in prostitution,\nin violation of Florida Statute § 796.o3. The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and secking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\n2 Emergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.* The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

After the court’s order, the Department\nrecused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nNorthern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government. Among the remedies sought\nby the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained\na federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and\none count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. The indictment alleged that from\n2oo2 until 2oo5, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida\nwhom he sexually abused and exploited. Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2ol9. In\narguing for Epstein’s pretrial detention, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein’s\nManhatan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least\none believed to be a minor. The court ordered Epstein detained pending trial, and he was remanded\nto the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in\nManhatan.\n\nMeanwhile, after publication of the November 2ol8 Miami Herald report, the media and\nCongress increasingly focused atention on Acosta as the government official responsible for the\nNPA. On July lo, 2ol9, Acosta held a televised press conference to defend his and the USAO’s\nactions. Acosta stated that the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office “was ready to allou Epstein to\nwalk free with no jail time, nothing.” According to Acosta, because USAO prosecutors considered\nthis outcome unacceptable, his office pursued a difficult and challenging case and obtained a\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> that put Epstein in jail, forced him to register as a sexual offender, and provided victims\nwith the means to obtain monetary damages.

Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3l88", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003192.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6 of 348\nlil.

Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home,\nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a\ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments. The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, ““Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.”\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\n8 Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n? In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003229.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 53 of 348\nrecalled generally having conversations with Sloman and Menchel about the Epstein case, but he\ncould not recall with specificity when those conversations took place or the details of the\ndiscussions.\n\nSloman told OPR that because of his broad responsibilities as FAUSA, he left it to\nMenchel, as a highly experienced trial atorney and the Criminal Division Chief, to work directly\nwith Acosta, and Sloman recalled that it was Menchel and Lourie who conducted a “granular\nreview” of the charging package. Acosta confirmed to OPR that Sloman and Menchel “were a\nteam” who became involved in issues as needed, and if Sloman perceived that Menchel was taking\nthe lead on the Epstein mater, Sloman may have deferred to Menchel.\n\nG. May — June 2oo7: Miami Managers Consider the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nand Proposed Charges\n\nWhen she submited the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia intended to file charges by\nMay l5, 2oo7, and the FBI planned to arrest Epstein immediately thereafter. Villafafia, houever,\nhad not obtained authorization to indict on that schedule. The managers in Miami wanted time to\nanalyze the lengthy prosecution memorandum and consider the potential charges and charging\nstrategy. Just a few days after he received the prosecution memorandum, and after learning that\nthe FBI was planning a press conference for May l5, Sloman advised Villafafia that “[t]his Office\nhas not approved the indictment. Therefore, please do not commit us to anything at this time.’°%\n\nOn May lo, 2oo7, with Menchel’s concurrence, Lourie sent a copy of Villafafia’s\nprosecution memorandum to CEOS Chief Andrew Oosterban, who in turn sent it to his deputy\nand another CEOS atorney, asking them to assess the legal issues involved in the case and\ndescribing it as a “highly sensitive” case involving “a high profile, very rich defendant.”*’ After\nCEOS reviewed the materials, Oosterban responded to Lourie with an email stating that the\nmemorandum was “exhaustive” and “well done” and noting that Villafafia “‘has correctly focused\non the issues as we see them.” He summarized CEOS’s analysis of the application of key facts to\nthe statutes she proposed charging, concurring in Villafafia’s assessments but noting that further\nresearch was needed to determine whether certain statutes required proof of a defendant’s\nknouledge of victims’ ages. Oosterban offered to assign a CEOS atorney to work with Villafafia\non the case. Lourie forwarded Oosterban’s email to Menchel and Villafafia.\n\nMeanwhile, contemporaneous emails shou that Lourie, at least, was already considering\nan early <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the case through a pre-indictment plea agreement.*” After Lourie spoke with\n38 Lourie later reported to Menchel that the FBI had “wanted to arrest [Epstein] in [the] Virgin Islands during a\nbeauty pageant ... where he is a judge.” The case agent recalled that she and her co-case agent were disappointed\nwith the decision, and that the Supervisory Special Agent was “extremely upset” about it. After the federal\ninvestigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2oo6, Epstein largely stayed\naway from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.\n\na Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterban was an AUSA at the USAO for about ten years and was good\nfriends with Lourie.\n4o In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it “may\nundermine our arguments for pretrial detention.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening\na bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3229", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003230.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 54 of 348\n\nthe FBI squad supervisor on May 9, 2oo7, to explain that charges against Epstein would not be\nquickly approved, he reported to Menchel that the FBI was “not happy” about the delay, adding,\n“T did not even tell them I think we should bring [Epstein] in, once we decide to charge him, and\noffer a pre-indictment deal, figuring a judge might never agree to such a deal post indictment. That\nwould have sent them thru the roof.” Lourie explained to OPR that he thought a judge, after seeing\nan indictment charging the full nature and scope of Epstein’s conduct, might not agree to a plea\ninvolving substantially less time or to dismiss substantive charges.\"!\n\nLourie told OPR that despite Oosterban’s favorable opinion of the case, “[t]his was...a\nbit of uncharted territory,” involving facts that were unlike the case law Oosterban had cited.\nAlthough Lourie had some concerns about the legal issues and about the witnesses, he “probably”\ndid not see any impediment to going forward with the case; in fact, Lourie “was not in favor of\nwalking away, which is what the defense wanted [the USAO] to do.” But while Lourie “thought\nwe could have won and we could have prevailed through appeal,” he “didn’t think the odds were\nnearly as good as you want in a criminal case, and . . . the things that we had to gain [through a\nplea agreement] were much more than [in] a normal criminal case,” in which the only cost of a\nloss would be that the defendant did not go to jail. Lourie told OPR that to the best of his\nrecollection, he thought a plea agreement would be a good result, and although the government\nmight have to “give up some jail time,” there were other benefits to a plea, such as the ability to\nrequire Epstein to register as a sex offender and the availability of monetary damages for the\nvictims. Lourie recalled “thinking that this case should setle and we should set it up so we can\nsetle it” by, for example, charging Epstein by complaint and then negotiating a plea to limited\ncharges in a criminal information. Villafafia told OPR that she agreed with Lourie that a criminal\ncomplaint charging an “omnibus conspiracy” containing “all of the information related to what the\ncase was about” would be a good way to “get things moving” touard a pre-indictment plea.\n\nAlthough Lourie and Villafafia believed a pre-indictment plea agreement was a desired\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, there was no guarantee that Epstein would agree to plead guilty, and they continued to\nwork together to shape an indictment. On May lo, 2oo7, Lourie emailed Villafafia:\n\n[Marie\n\nI believe that Epstein’s at[orneys] are scared of the victims they\n\ndon’t knou. Epstein has no doubt told them that there were many.\n\nThus I believe the flir]st indictment should contain only the victims\n\nthey have nothing on at all. We can add in the other ones that have\n\nmyspace [sic] pages and prior testimony in a [superseding\n\nindictment]. I think for the first strike we should make all their\n\nnightmare[]s come true. Thoughts?”\n4 Lourie explained to OPR that the government’s dismissal of counts in an indictment required the court’s\napproval, and that, while “it’s rare,” it was possible that a judge, seeing the nature and extent of Epstein’s conduct as\nset forth in an extensive indictment, might not allou substantive counts to be dismissed.\n2 Lourie’s references to MySpace pages and “prior testimony” referred to the impeachment information\nbrought forward by defense counsel.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo323o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003231.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 55 of 348\n\nLourie folloued up his email to Villafafia with one to Menchel, in which Lourie reiterated\nthe potential benefits of a pre-indictment plea, explaining that he and Villafafia believed “the best\nthing to do is charge Epstein by complaint, assuming we decide to charge him. ... The\n[sentencing] guidelines will be in the 2o year range, so we would need to plead him to one or two\nconspiracies to cap him and there is no telling if a judge would go for that once we indict.””\nMenchel responded that he and Acosta would read the prosecution memorandum and “[w]e can\ndiscuss after that.”\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia sent Lourie an email, which Lourie forwarded to Menchel,\nexplaining that a “conservative calculation” of Epstein’s potential sentencing exposure under the\nU.S. Sentencing Guidelines would be l68 to 2lo months, and that in her view, the facts warranted\nan upward departure from that range. Villafafia told OPR that although Lourie proposed some\nchanges to the draft indictment, at that point no one had told her that the evidence was insufficient\nto support the proposed charges or that the office did not want to go forward with the case.\n\nIn an email to Acosta and Menchel on May ll, 2oo7, Lourie recommended charging\nEpstein by complaint and seeking a pre-indictment plea:\n\nMy current thoughts are that we should charge him. Not sure that I\nagree with the charging strategy as it is nou, but at this point I think\nwe only need to get on the same page as to whether the statutes cover\nthe conduct and whether the conduct is the type we should charge.\nI think the answer to both is yes, although there is some risk on some\nof the statutes as this is uncharted territory to some degree. We can\ndecide later what the [charging document] should look like precisely\nand which victims should be charged.\n\nI also think if we choose to go forward, we should start with a\ncomplaint, arrest him, detain him . . . and then try to see if he wants\na pre-indictment <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. That would give us more control [over]\na plea than if we indict him and need the court’s approval to dismiss\ncounts. We will need to cap him with conspiracy counts to make a\nplea atractive and the court could give us a hard time with that if we\ntry to dismiss indicted counts.\n\nAlthough her supervisors were communicating among themselves about the case, Villafafia\nwas unaware of those discussions and was frustrated that she was not receiving more feedback.\nShe continued preparing to charge Epstein. Two weeks after submiting the prosecution\nmemorandum, on May l4, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Lourie and Menchel by email that Epstein\nwas flying to New Jersey from the Virgin Islands, and she asked whether she could file charges\nthe next day. Menchel responded that “[y]ou will not have approval to go forward tomorrou,”\nand explained that Acosta “has your [prosecution] memo,” but was at an out-of-toun conference,\nadding, “This is obviously a very significant case and [A]lex wants to take his time making sure\n43 Lourie told OPR that he was referring to one or two counts of conspiracy under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, the general\n“omnibus” federal conspiracy statute that carries a maximum sentence of five years.\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR- oooo323l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003238.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 62 of 348\ndamages.°>> During a two-month period, the subject atorneys were involved to varying degrees in\nconverting the broad outline into specific terms, resulting in the NPA signed by Epstein on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both\nthe larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of\nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the\nfacts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> or the NPA.\n\nIn the follouing account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous\ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR\nquestioned each of the subjects about hou the decision was reached to pursue a state <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>,\nand OPR includes belou the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA. June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea <span class=\"highlight\">Resolution</span>, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> shortly thereafter.”>° In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal investigation that could\n» State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw enforcement and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities. The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry\nis administered by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n56 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3238", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003239.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 63 of 348\ninclude concurrent time.” The email primarily concerned other issues, and Villafafia did not\nexplain what the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> she had in mind would entail.*’ Villafafia requested to be advised,\n“Ti]f anyone has communicated anything to Epstein’s atorneys that is contrary to this.” Villafafia,\nwho was aware that Menchel and Lourie had been in direct contact with defense counsel about the\ncase, explained to OPR that she made this request because “people were communicating with the\ndefense atorneys,” and she suspected that those communications may have included discussions\nabout a possible plea.\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s email, Menchel notified Villafafia that he had told Sanchez “a\nstate plea [with] jail time and sex offender status may satisfy the [U.S. Atorney],” but Sanchez\nhad responded that it “was a non-starter for them.”°* During his OPR interview, Menchel had no\nindependent recollection of his conversation with Sanchez and did not remember why the defense\ndeemed the proposal a “non-starter.”. Houever, Menchel explained that he would not have made\nthe proposal to Sanchez without Acosta’s knouledge. He also pointed out that in numerous emails\nbefore the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, he repeatedly noted that Acosta was still deciding what he\nwanted to do with the Epstein case. Acosta agreed, telling OPR that although he did not remember\na specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, Menchel would not have\ndiscussed a potential <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> with Sanchez “without having discussed it with me.”\n\nl. Acosta’s Explanation for His Decision to Pursue a State-based\n<span class=\"highlight\">Resolution</span>\n\nSubsequent events shoued that the decision to resolve the case through state charges was\npivotal, and OPR extensively questioned Acosta about his reasoning. In his OPR interview, Acosta\nexplained the various factors that influenced his decision to pursue a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. Acosta\nsaid that although he, Sloman, and Menchel “believed the victims” and “believed [Epstein] did\nwhat he did,” they were concerned “about some of the legal issues . . . and some of the issues in\nterms of testimony.”°’ Acosta also recalled discussions with his “senior team” about hou the\nvictims would “do on the stand.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “from the earliest point” in the investigation, he considered whether,\nbecause the state had indicted the case, the USAO should pursue it.\n\na Villafafia explained to OPR that she intended to recommend a plea to a federal conspiracy charge and a\nsubstantive charge, “consistent with the Ashcroft Memo, which would be the most readily provable offense,” with “a\nrecommendation that the sentence on the federal charges run concurrent with the state sentence, or that [Epstein]\nwould receive credit for time in state custody touards his federal release date.” See n.65 for an explanation of the\nAshcroft Memo.\n\nm8 Villafafia was then in trial and on July 4, 2oo7, likely before reading Menchel’s email, Villafafia responded\nto defense counsel regarding the demand for records and also noted, “If you would like to discuss the possibility of a\nfederal <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> . . . that could run concurrently with any state <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, please leave a message on my voicemail.”\n9 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Sloman stated he had no involvement in assessing the Epstein case or\ndeciding hou to resolve it, and that OPR should not identify him as among the people upon whom Acosta relied in\nreaching the two-year-state-plea <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> through the NPA. Houever, Sloman also told OPR that he had litle\nrecollection of the Epstein case, while Acosta specifically recalled having discussed the case with both Sloman and\nMenchel.\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3239", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003241.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 65 of 348\nI do think it’s important to look back on this, and try to be in the\nshoes of the thought process in 2oo6 and ’o7 when trafficking\nprosecutions were fairly new, when . . . more so than today, some\njurors may have looked at this as prostitution, and . . . [a] judge’s\ntolerance for victim shaming may have . . . caused more hesitation\non the part of victims... .©\nFinally, Acosta told OPR that a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> offered more flexibility in fashioning\na sentence, because he believed prosecutors would have difficulty persuading a federal district\ncourt in the Southern District of Florida to approve a federal plea for a stipulated binding sentence\nthat differed from the otherwise applicable federal sentencing guidelines range. **\nIn summarizing his thinking at the time, Acosta told OPR,\nThe way the mater came to the office was, the state wasn’t doing\nenough. It didn’t provide for prison time. It didn’t provide for\nregistration, and then you had the restitution issue. There were legal\nissues ... . There were witness issues. And... we could go to trial\n...and we may or may not prevail. Alternatively, we could look at\na pre-indictment <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, and at various points, the office went\nback and forth between a federal pre-indictment <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, and a\nstate pre-indictment <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>.\nAcosta told OPR that, in the end, “there was a preference for deferring to the state” because, in\npart, the facts of the Epstein case at the time appeared to constitute solicitation or prostitution\nrather than trafficking, and a federal prosecution would be “uncharted territory.” Acosta explained\nthat he did not view it as problematic to defer <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the case to the state, although as the\nEpstein case played out, the federal role became “more intrusive” than he had anticipated, because\nthe defense tried to get the state to “circumvent and undermine” the outcome.\nAtorney’s Office could have proceeded against Epstein by way of an information, but decided to go into the grand\njury because the State Atorney’s Office “didn’t like the case” and wanted “political cover” for declining the case or\nproceeding on a lesser charge.\n3 Menchel told OPR, houever, that the federal judges in West Palm Beach were highly regarded and were\ngenerally viewed as “pro-prosecution.”\not Acosta said that “dismissing a number of counts and then doing a [R]ule ll is not something that [South\nFlorida federal district] judges tend to do.” Other subjects also told OPR that the federal judges in the Southern District\nof Florida were generally considered averse to pleas that bound them on sentencing, commonly referred to as “Rule\nll(c) pleas.”\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) allous the parties to agree on a specific sentence as part of\na plea agreement. The court is required to impose that sentence if the court accepts the plea agreement; if the court\ndoes not accept the agreed upon plea and sentence, the agreement is void. Villafafia told OPR that Rule ll(c) pleas\nwere “uncommon” in the Southern District of Florida, as the “judges do not like to be told . . . what sentence to\nimpose.” Menchel similarly told OPR that the USAO viewed federal judges in the Southern District of Florida as\naverse to Rule ll(c) pleas, although Menchel had negotiated such pleas. Villafafia told OPR that she had never offered\na Rule ll(c) plea in any of her cases and had no experience with such pleas.\n39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo324l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003242.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 66 of 348\nMenchel could not recall who initially suggested a state plea, but noted to OPR that his\n\noun “emails . .. make clear that this course of action was ultimately decided by Alex Acosta.” He\nreferenced, among others, his May l4, 2oo7 email to Villafafia informing her that Acosta was\ndeciding hou he wanted to handle the case. Menchel surmised that a state <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> accomplished\ntwo things that Acosta viewed as important: first, it resolved any Petite policy concerns, and\nsecond, it afforded more flexibility in sentencing than a federal plea would have alloued. Menchel\ntold OPR that the state plea proposal did not reflect any minimization of Epstein’s conduct and\nthat any state plea would have been to an offense that required sexual offender registration. He\ntold OPR, “I don’t think anybody sat around and said, you knou, it’s not that big a deal. That was\nnot the reaction that I think anybody had from the federal side of this case.” Rather, Menchel said,\n“The concern was if we charge him [as proposed], there’s going to be a trial.”\n\nDe July 2oo7: Villafaia and Menchel Disagree about the Proposed State\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Resolution</span>\nVillafafia told OPR that she was angry when she received Menchel’s July email explaining\n\nthat he had proposed to Sanchez resolving the federal investigation through a state plea. In\nVillafafia’s view, the proposed state <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> “didn’t make any sense” and “did not correspond”\nto Department policy requiring that a plea offer reflect “the most serious readily provable\noffense.”® In her view, a plea to a state charge “obviously” would not satisfy this policy. Villafafia\nalso told OPR that in her view, the USAM required the USAO to confer with the investigative\nagency about plea negotiations, and Villafafia did not believe the FBI would be in favor of a state\nplea. Villafafia also believed the CVRA required atorneys for the government to confer with\nvictims before making a plea offer, but the victims had not been consulted about this proposal.\nVillafafia told OPR she had met with some of the victims during the course of the investigation\nwho had negative impressions of the State Atorney’s Office, and she believed that “sending them\nback to the State Atorney’s Office was not something” those victims would support.\n& This policy was set forth in a September 22, 2oo3 memorandum from then Atorney General John Ashcroft\nregarding “Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and Sentencing”\n(knoun as the “Ashcroft Memo”), which provided, in pertinent part:\n\n[I]n all federal criminal cases, federal prosecutors must charge and pursue the\n\nmost serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts\n\nof the case, except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, United States\n\nAtorney, or designated supervisory atorney in the limited circumstances\n\ndescribed belou. The most serious offense or offenses are those that generate the\n\nmost substantial sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, unless a mandatory\n\nminimum sentence or count requiring a consecutive sentence would generate a\n\nlonger sentence. A charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor has a good\n\nfaith doubt, for legal or evidentiary reasons, as to the Government’s ability readily\n\nto prove a charge at trial. Thus, charges should not be filed simply to exert\n\nleverage to induce a plea. Once filed, the most serious readily provable charges\n\nmay not be dismissed except to the extent permited [elsewhere in this\n\nMemorandum].\nSee also Chapter Two, Part Two, Section II.B.l.\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3242", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003243.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 67 of 348\n\nIn light of these concerns, Villafafia emailed Menchel, expressing her strong disagreement\nwith the process:\n\n[I]t is inappropriate for you to enter into plea negotiations without\nconsulting with me or the investigative agencies, and it is more\ninappropriate to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE [Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement], the victims, and me. These plea negotiations violate\nthe Ashcroft memo, the U.S. Atorney[s’] Manual, and all of the\nvarious iterations of the victims’ rights legislation. Strategically,\nyou have started the plea negotiations as though we are in a position\nof weakness, anxious to make the case go away, by telling the\ndefense that we will demand no federal conviction. We left the\nmeeting on June 26th in a stronger position than when we entered,\nand your statement that a state <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> would satisfy us takes\naway that advantage. If you make it seem like the U.S. Atorney\ndoesn’t have faith in our investigation, Epstein has no incentive to\nmake a deal.\n\nSecond, your discussion makes it appear that my investigation is for\n“shou” only and completely undermines my ability to deal with\nEpstein’s atorneys directly. ...\n\nI would like to make a presentation to the U.S. Atorney, Jeff\n[Sloman], Andy [Lourie], and you with our side of the investigation\nand a revised indictment. The presentation will address the points\nraised by Epstein’s counsel and will convince you all of the strength\nof the case.\n\nIn the meantime, please direct all communications from Epstein’s\ncounsel to me.\n\nMenchel told OPR he realized Villafafia was “very anxious” to file charges in the case.\nVillafafia had put a “tremendous” amount of effort into the investigation, and Menchel “was not\nunsympathetic at all to her desires” to pursue a federal case. Houever, as Menchel told OPR,\nVillafafia’s supervisors, including Acosta, were “trying to be a litle bit more dispassionate,” and\nher urgency was “not respectful” of Acosta’s position. Menchel viewed the tone of Villafafia’s\nemail as “highly unacceptable,” and her understanding of applicable law and policy incorrect. In\nparticular, Menchel pointed out that although the Ashcroft Memo requires prosecutors to charge\nthe “most readily provable offense,” there is nevertheless room for “flexibility,” and that the U.S.\nAtorney has discretion—directly or through a designated supervisor such as Menchel—to waive\nthe policy.\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3243", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003248.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 72 of 348\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n2 In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

Acosta Decides on a <span class=\"highlight\">Resolution</span> That Includes a Two-Year Term of\nIncarceration\n\nThe next critical step in the development of the NPA was the decision to propose a two-\nyear term of imprisonment. Although presented to the defense as the “minimum” the USAO would\naccept, in actuality the two-year proposal became only the starting point for the negotiations, with\nthe result that the defense continued to chip away at it as the negotiations continued. The\ncontemporaneous emails make no mention of any rationale for the decision to propose two years\nas the government’s beginning negotiating position, and nobody with whom OPR spoke was able\nto recall hou the decision was made. As discussed belou, Acosta did offer OPR an explanation,\nbut OPR was unable to find contemporaneous evidence supporting it.”°\n\nWhile the defense was communicating its objections to the federal investigation to\nVillafafia, Lourie, Menchel, and Sloman, Villafafia continued moving touard filing charges. On\nJuly l9, 2oo7, the day after receiving Oosterban’s email supporting a potential prosecution,\nVillafafia emailed Lourie and Menchel seeking approval to take further investigative steps\nregarding three of Epstein’s assistants. Houever, Menchel directed Villafafia to “hold off... until\nwe decide what course of action we are going to take on [E]pstein which should happen next\nweek.” Menchel told OPR that he did not specifically recall why he asked Villafafia to wait, but\nhe assumed it was because Acosta was deciding what course of action to take on the case.\n\nOn Monday, July 23, 2oo7, Menchel submited a resignation notice to Acosta, stating that\nhe would be leaving the USAO effective August 6, 2oo7.77\n\nl. The July 26, 2oo7 Meeting in Miami\n\nEarly on the morning of Thursday, July 26, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Menchel that she was\npreparing a new draft indictment containing revisions he had suggested, including removal of all\nbut three of the “travel counts” and “a large number of [the] overt acts,” and the addition of overt\nacts and counts relating to two additional victims; she would not, houever, have the revised\nindictment ready in time “for our discussion today” at their 2:oo p.m. meeting. Menchel told OPR\nthat the fact that he had both proposed revisions to the indictment and also directed Villafafia to\ndelay the investigative steps involving the assistants indicated that he was “trying to do something”\nwith the case, but was waiting for Acosta to decide the “underlying issue” of whether to proceed\nwith federal charges.\n\nAcosta made that decision on or before July 26, 2oo7. On that afternoon, Villafafia met in\nMiami with Menchel. She told OPR that Sloman, as well as the FBI case agents and their\nsupervisors, were also present, with Lourie participating by telephone. Villafafia told OPR that\nshe expected that the meeting, requested by Menchel, would address the direction of the\ninvestigation. Houever, Villafafia told OPR that after everyone had assembled, Menchel entered\nthe room and stated that Acosta “has decided to offer a two-year state deal.” According to\nSee Section IV.D.2 in this Part.\na As early as May 4, 2oo7, Menchel had informed Acosta that he was intending to leave the USAO to enter\nprivate practice.\n\n48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo325o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003251.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 75 of 348\nVillafafia, Menchel left the meeting after almost no discussion, leaving Villafafia “shocked and\nstunned.”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall the July 26, 2oo7 meeting. Nonetheless, he\nstrongly disputed Villafafia’s description of events, asserting that it would have been “directly at\nodds with his management style” to convene such a meeting, announce Acosta’s decision, and\nleave without discussion. Acosta told OPR that he had “decided and endorsed this <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> at\nsome point,” but he did not recall being aware that Menchel was going to announce the decision\nat the July 26 meeting; in addition, although Acosta did not recall the circumstances of Menchel’s\nrelaying of that decision, he said it “would have been consistent with” his decision for Menchel to\ndo so. Neither Sloman nor Lourie recalled the meeting. The FBI case agent recalled atending a\nmeeting at the USAO in Miami with her co-case agent and supervisors, together with Villafafia,\nLourie (by telephone), Menchel, and Sloman, at which they discussed hou to proceed with the\nEpstein case. According to the case agent, at this meeting the FBI insisted that Epstein be\nregistered for life as a sexual offender, and the co-case agent advocated for waiting until the court\nhad ruled on the USAO’s ability to obtain Epstein’s computer equipment.\n\nRegardless of exactly hou Acosta’s decision regarding the two-year term was\ncommunicated to Villafafia and the FBI agents, and regardless of who initially proposed the\nspecific term, the record shous that Acosta ultimately made the decision to offer Epstein a\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> that included a two-year term of imprisonment, as he acknouledged.”\n\nDe The Subjects’ Explanations for the Decision to Offer Epstein a Sentence\nwith a Two-Year Term of Incarceration\n\nVillafafia asserted that she was not consulted about the specific two-year term before the\ndecision was made.” Villafafia told OPR that she had worked hard to develop a strong case, and\nnone of her supervisors had identified to her any specific problem with the case that, in her view,\nexplained the decision to extend an offer for a two-year sentence. Villafafia also told OPR that\nMenchel provided no explanation for this decision during the July 26, 2oo7 meeting, and Villafafia\ndid not ask for an explanation because she accepted his statement that it was Acosta’s decision.\nVillafafia described the proposal as “random,” and told OPR, “[W]e’re all [sentencing] guidelines\npeople, so 24 months just makes no sense in the context of the guidelines. There’s no way to get\nto 24 months with this set of offenses.”*°\nl8 OPR notes that Villafafia did not appear hesitant to send emails to her supervisors seting forth her views and\nobjections, and there is no reference before this meeting in any of her emails indicating that a decision had been made\nto offer a two-year term of incarceration. Therefore, given that a meeting had been arranged involving Menchel and\nVillafafia, and possibly most of the other primary USAO and FBI participants, it seems logical that Acosta made a\ndecision to resolve the case with a two-year state plea not long before the meeting.\n\n2 OPR found no evidence in the documentary record indicating that Villafafia had knouledge of Acosta’s\ndecision or the two-year term before the July 26, 2oo7 meeting at which she said she learned of it.\n8o From the time the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines went into effect in l987, they have been the mechanism for\ncalculating federal criminal sentences. Since 2oo5, the Guidelines have been non-binding, but the federal courts are\nrequired to consider them. As noted in the commentary to USAM § 9-27.7lo,\n49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo325l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003252.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 76 of 348\n\nSloman also told OPR that he did not knou hou the decision to offer a two-year plea offer\nwas reached, but he believed that Acosta made the decision based on recommendations from\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. He opined to OPR that the decision was likely based on an\nassessment by Menchel and Lourie of the litigation risks presented by the case.*! Sloman added\nthat he did not knou hou a two-year sentence might have related to specific charges or to either\nstate or federal sentencing guidelines. Lourie likewise told OPR he did not recall hou the two-year\nterm was decided upon, or by whom, but he speculated that it may have been presented by the\ndefense as the most Epstein would accept, and that the decision would have been reached by\nAcosta follouing “extended consideration, research, and discussion,” among Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. *”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall discussing a two-year plea deal with Acosta or\nwho reached the decision that two years was an appropriate sentence. Menchel also told OPR,\nhouever, that he recalled believing that if the USAO had filed the contemplated federal charges,\nEpstein would have felt he had “‘nothing to lose” and “undoubtedly” would have chosen to take\nthe case to trial. Menchel recalled believing there was a real risk that the USAO might lose at trial,\nand in so doing, might cause more trauma to the victims, particularly those who were reluctant to\ntestify. Menchel told OPR that he did not believe that anyone at the time looked at two years “as\na fair result in terms of the conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not\nif we took this case to trial, would we risk losing everything,” and “if we . . . felt we could have\ngoten more time, we would have, without having to press it to the trial.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “I had decided and endorsed” the two-year <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> “at some\npoint,” and that it resulted from “back and forth” discussion “over the course of some days or a\nweek or two.” As noted earlier in this Report, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in this case merely\nas a “backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he explained to OPR was “a polite way of saying[,\n‘Jencouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]”*? Acosta said that he understood two years’\nimprisonment to have represented the sentence Epstein faced under one of the original charges the\nPBPD was considering at the outset of the state investigation.** Acosta also told OPR that he\n\nthe atorney for the government has a continuing obligation to assist the court in\n\nits determination of the sentence to be imposed. The prosecutor must be familiar\n\nwith the guidelines generally and with the specific guideline provisions applicable\n\nto his or her case. In discharging these duties, the atorney for the government\n\nshould . . . endeavor to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information\n\nupon which the sentencing decisions will be based.\na In Sloman’s view, Menchel and Lourie were “two of the finest trial lawyers” in the USAO.\nae Lourie noted that Sloman and Menchel were “two extraordinarily experienced people in [Acosta’s] front\noffice who had tried . . . gobs and gobs of cases.”\n83 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney asserted that OPR’s use of Acosta’s quote, “a litle\nbit more,” “unfairly minimized” Acosta’s and the USAO’s efforts to achieve justice in this case. Acosta’s atorney\nalso asserted that the phrase was “clearly soft-spoken understatement,” that the terms obtained were “substantially\nmore onerous than the state’s alternative <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>,” and that Acosta was “clearly declining the invitation to take the\nState to task and soft-pedaling an obvious distinction.”\n\n84 OPR examined this assertion and was unable to verify that the proposed two-year term of imprisonment\ncorresponded with the charges that the PBPD considered at the outset of the state investigation or with the charge in\n5o\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3252", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003256.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8o of 348\nthe period of imprisonment, because the USAO failed to hold firm to its proposal of “at least two\nyears in prison.” The USAO did, houever, consistently reject defense proposals to change other\nterms, particularly the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.\n\nA. July 3l, 2oo7: The USAO Presents Its Proposal to the Defense Team, which\n\nMakes a Counteroffer\n\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, Villafafia, and the case agents met with Epstein atorneys\nLefcourt, Sanchez, and Black on July 3l, 2oo7, with Menchel “leading the meeting” for the\nUSAO.*’’ The USAO presented the term sheet, and Villafafia distributed a federal sentencing\nguidelines calculation shouing that if prosecuted federally, Epstein faced a sentencing range of\nl88 to 235 months’ incarceration.\n\nVillafafia recalled that during the meeting, Epstein’s atorneys opposed the requirement of\nsexual offender registration, argued that Epstein would not be safe in prison, suggested that Epstein\nserve a sentence of home confinement or “community control”*® in licu of incarceration, and\nemphasized that a state <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> provided greater sentencing flexibility.*’ Villafafia told OPR\nthat when Epstein’s atorneys expressed concern during the meeting about Epstein’s security in a\nstate prison and argued for a home confinement sentence, Menchel suggested Epstein plead to a\nfederal charge so that he could serve his time in a federal facility. A few days after the meeting,\nVillafafia emailed Menchel, stating that she had “figured out a way to do a federal plea with a 2-l/2\nyear cap.”\n\nAlthough Acosta had authorized a plea to state charges, emails and other correspondence\nshou that during the negotiations, the parties also considered structuring a plea around federal\ney Villafafia was the only witness with whom OPR spoke who had a substantive memory of this meeting.\n\n88 According to the Florida Department of Corrections fact sheet for defendants subjected to community control,\n\nThe Community Control supervision program was created as a diversion to\n\nincarceration or imprisonment; therefore it is an intensive supervision program\n\nwhere you are confined to your home unless you are working, atending school,\n\nperforming public service hours, participating in treatment or another special\n\nactivity that has been approved in advance by your officer. The program was\n\ndesigned to build accountability and responsibility along with providing a\n\npunishment alternative to imprisonment. While on Community Control\n\nsupervision (also knoun as “house arrest”) you will not be alloued to leave your\n\nhome to visit family or friends, go out to dinner or to the movies, go on vacation,\n\nor many of the other activities you are used to being able to do... , but it does\n\nallou you to continue to work to support yourself and your family or atend school\n\nin lieu of being incarcerated and away from loved ones.\nFlorida Dept. of Corrections, Succeeding on Community Control at l, htp://www.de.state. fl.us/cc/ceforms/\nSucceeding-on-Community-Control.pdf.\n8 Villafafia told OPR that she was concerned about a state <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> because the defense team “had a lot of\nexperience with the state system. We did not.” Villafafia anticipated there would be ways to “manipulate” a state\nsentence and the USAO would be “giving up all control,” and she told OPR that she discussed this concern with\nLourie, although she could not recall when that discussion occurred.\n\n54\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3256", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003259.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 83 of 348\nSees U.S. Department of Justice\nCy United States Atorney\na = uae Southern District of Florida\nAR.

That offer was not meant as a starting point for negotiations, it is the minimum\nterm of imprisonment that will obviate the need for federal prosecution. The Office has\nnever agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate for Mr. Epstein.

Sloman similarly told OPR that the squad supervisor “like\n[Villafafia] . . . [a]nd the agents felt very strongly about the case.”\n\nC. August — September 2oo7: Epstein Hires Additional Atorneys, Who Meet\n\nwith Acosta\nl. Acosta Agrees to Meet with Epstein’s New Atorneys\n\nVillafafia told OPR that Epstein’s team was “incensed” that Acosta would not meet with\nthem and that the USAO had set such a short deadline to respond to its offer. Around this time,\nEpstein added to his team Kenneth Starr and Jay Lefkouitz, two prominent atorneys from the law\nfirm Kirkland & Ellis, whom Acosta knew from his employment a decade earlier as an associate\nat the firm.** On the evening of August 6, 2oo7, Sloman emailed Acosta: “Just saw Menchel. I\ndidn’t knou Kirkland made a call into you. You were right. Unbelievable.” During their OPR\ninterviews, neither Acosta nor Sloman remembered the call from Kirkland & Ellis and could\nprovide no additional information about the contact.?> A reply email from Acosta to Sloman\nindicates that the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys were considering elevating to the Department their\nobjections to the USAO’s involvement in the Epstein mater. In that email, Acosta stated, “They\nare likely to go to DC. We should strategize a bit. We are not changing positions, and that should\nbe made clear.”\n\nThe next day, Acosta wrote to Sloman:\n\n[Epstein’s] atorneys want to go to DC on the case, on the grounds\n\nof a process foul, i.e., that Ihave not met with them. I’m concerned\n\nthat this will delay maters.\n\nI am thinking of heading this off, by (l) agreeing to meet to discuss\n\ngeneral legal policy only (the only mater in which DC has arguable\n23 In an email to Lourie reporting the conversation, Sloman reported that he told the squad supervisor that “it’s\na tad more complicated” and commented, “The guy is killing me.” The squad supervisor told OPR that he did not\nremember this exchange with Sloman, but he recalled the agents being “upset” with the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the\ncase and he likely would have told Sloman, “When do we indict? Why don’t we just move forward?”\nad Acosta told OPR that as a junior associate with Kirkland & Ellis from September l995 to March l997, he\nhad worked on at least one mater each with Starr and Lefkouitz, and since that time, he had professional\nacquaintanceships with both.\n9s Menchel told OPR that he did not remember the timing of the call, but he did remember an occasion on which\nhe entered Acosta’s office as Acosta was finishing a phone conversation, and Acosta stated, “[T]hat was Ken Starr,”\nand told Menchel the call related to the Epstein case.\n\n59\nDOJ-OGR- oooo326l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003265.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 89 of 348\nforward, that either there is this pre-indictment <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, or we go forward with an indictment.\nThe September meeting did not alter or shift our position.” !\n\nVillafafia told OPR that after hearing the defense argument, Acosta reiterated that the\nfederal interest in the case could be vindicated only by a state plea to an offense that required\nsexual offender registration, resulted in a two-year term of incarceration, and was subject to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 process for providing compensation to the victims. When defense counsel\nobjected to the registration requirement, Acosta held firm, and he also rejected the defense proposal\nfor a sentence of home confinement. In a subsequent email exchange with Criminal Division\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal Mandelker, who supervised CEOS, Oosterban reported\nthat the meeting was “non-eventful,” noting that defense counsel argued “federalism” and might\napproach Criminal Division Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher to present that argument\ndirectly to her.\n\nVI. SEPTEMBER 2oo7: THE PLEA NEGOTIATIONS INTENSIFY, AND IN THE\n\nPROCESS, THE REQUIRED TERM OF IMPRISONMENT IS REDUCED\n\nAcosta had dispensed with the August l7, 2oo7 plea deadline specified in Menchel’s\nAugust 3, 2oo7 leter, in order to allou the defense to meet with him. After that meeting, and\nalthough Villafafia continued to plan to file charges on September 25, no new plea deadline was\nestablished, and the negotiations continued through most of September.\n\nThe defense used that time to push the USAO to make concessions. Because Acosta was\nnot willing to compromise on the issue of sexual offender registration or providing a means\nthrough which the victims could seek monetary damages, the negotiations focused on the term of\nimprisonment. As the contemporaneous emails shou, the USAO did not hold to its position that\na two-year term of imprisonment was “the minimum” that the USAO would accept. To reach an\nagreement with the defense on Epstein’s sentence, the USAO explored possible pleas in either\nfederal or state court, or both, and Villafafia spent considerable time and effort working with\ndefense counsel on developing alternative pleas with various outcomes. In the course of that\nprocess, the agreement was revised to require that Epstein accept a sentence of l8 months, with\nthe understanding that under the state’s sentencing procedures, he would likely serve just l5\nmonths.\n\nA. The Incarceration Term Is Reduced from 24 Months to 2o Months\n\nShortly after the September 7, 2oo7 meeting, Epstein atorney Gerald Lefcourt, who had\nnot been present at the meeting, spoke with both Acosta and Lourie, and made a new counteroffer,\nproposing that Epstein serve l5 months in jail folloued by l5 months in home confinement. On\nthe afternoon of Monday, September lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, identifying issues she\nwanted to discuss with him, including her concern that defense counsel was pushing for a\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> that would allou Epstein to avoid incarceration and possibly sexual offender\nregistration. Villafafia stated that Lefcourt’s counteroffer was “a reasonable counteroffer in light\nof our starting position of 24 months,” but added that it was “a really lou sentence.” Villafafia\nlo3 Sloman echoed this point, telling OPR that Starr’s presentation focused on the issue of federalism, but the\nUSAO had already decided to defer prosecution to the state and after the meeting, the USAO continued on that path.\n\n63\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3265", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003267.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 9l of 348\n\nVillafafia told OPR that during the meeting, the group discussed the draft NPA, but she did\nnot think they gave a copy to Krischer and Belohlavek. Neither Krischer nor Belohlavek expressed\nconcer about proceeding as the USAO was proposing. According to Villafafia, Belohlavek\nexplained that a plea to the three state counts identified in the draft NPA would affect the state’s\nsentencing guidelines, and that it would be beter for the guidelines calculation if Epstein pled\nguilty to just one of the three counts. Villafafia recalled that when Belohlavek confirmed that\nEpstein would be required to register as a sexual offender if he pled to any one of the three charges,\nLourie, speaking for the USAO, agreed to allou Epstein to enter his plea to just one state charge\nin addition to the pending state indictment, and the defense atorneys selected the charge of\nprocurement of minors to engage in prostitution.!°° Lourie, houever, disputed Villafafia’s\nrecollection that he made the final decision, stating that it was “illogical” to conclude that he had\nthe authority to change the terms of agreement unilaterally. !°’\n\nDuring the meeting, defense counsel raised concerns about Epstein serving time in state\nprison. Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie, the other supervisor, and she made clear during the\nmeeting that they expected Epstein to be incarcerated 24 hours a day, seven days a week, during\nthe entirety of his sentence, and they did not “particularly care” whether it was in a state or local\nfacility. Belohlavek explained to OPR that in order for Epstein to serve his time in a county\nfacility, rather than state prison, his sentence on each charge could be no more than l2 months, so\nthat, for example, consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months—totaling l8 months—could be\nserved in the county jail. Villafafia told OPR:\n\nOur thing was incarceration 24 hours a day. So during this meeting,\n\nI remember [the defense] talking about .. .a one year count folloued\n\nby a six-month count . . . that [Epstein] could serve them back to\n\nback but at the county jail, rather than having to go to a state facility.\n\nBut then I said, “But if you do that, it’s still going to have to be round\n\nthe clock incarceration.” And Barry Krischer said yes. And [he]\n\nsaid that to avoid [Epstein being extorted while incarcerated], he\n\nwould be kept in solitary confinement.\nVillafafia did not recall whether she and Lourie agreed to an l8-month sentence during that\nmeeting, but she told OPR that in her view, allouing Epstein to serve his sentence in the county\njail was not a “concession” because he would be incarcerated regardless.\n\nNeither Lourie nor the other USAO supervisor present could recall any substantive details\nof the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and Krischer and Belohlavek told OPR they did not remember\nthe meeting at all. Krischer did, houever, recall that he was “not offended at all” when he learned\nof the proposed federal <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, requiring Epstein to plead to both the pending state indictment\nand an additional charge requiring sexual offender registration, explaining to OPR that Epstein\n“was going to plead guilty to my indictment, we were going to add an additional charge, he was\nlo6 Later, the defense would claim that they had mistakenly understood that the selected charge would not\ninvolve sexual offender registration.\n\nlo7 As noted belou, a contemporaneous email indicates that shortly after the meeting, Lourie and Villafafia spoke\nwith Acosta and Sloman, who concurred with the agreement.\n65\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3267", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003268.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 92 of 348\ngoing to become a registered sex offender, and he was going to go actually do time—which he\nhadn’t done up to this point.” Krischer asked, “Why would I turn that doun?” Krischer also noted\nthat at that time, sexual offender registration “was not the norm” in Florida, and he recognized that\n“it was clearly something that was important to the U.S. Atorney’s Office.” !\n\nAcosta told OPR that he did not recall if he learned what transpired at the September l2\nmeeting, nor did he recall why the USAO team agreed to permit Epstein to plead guilty to only\none charge. Acosta told OPR, houever, that he recognized that Villafafia and Lourie needed “some\ndegree of discretion to negotiate”; that “in the give and take” of negotiations, they might propose\na concession; and he was comfortable with the concession as long as the charge to which Epstein\nultimately pled “captured the conduct” in an “appropriate” way.\n\nAlthough Epstein’s atorneys expressed interest in Epstein serving his time in a county\nfacility (rather than state prison), one of Epstein’s atorneys alternatively expressed interest in\nEpstein serving his time in a federal facility, and along with discussions about the possible state\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, the USAO and Epstein’s counsel also discussed a possible federal plea with a sentence\nrunning concurrently to the sentence Epstein would receive on the already indicted state charge.\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz an email advising that she and Lourie had talked with\nAcosta and Sloman, and they were “all satisfied in principle with the agreement.”!” The next day,\nSeptember l3, 2oo7, Villafafia sent an email to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and two other supervisors,\nidentifying potential federal offenses that would yield a two-year sentence. Villafafia also emailed\ndefense counsel, stating that she had been “spending some quality time with Title l8”—referring\nto the code of federal criminal statutes—to make sure there would be a “factual basis” for any\nfederal plea, and identifying the federal statutes she was considering.\n\nC. The Evidence Does Not Clearly Shou Why the Term of Incarceration Was\n\nReduced from 24 Months to 2o Months to l8 Months\n\nOPR reviewed the contemporaneous records and asked Acosta, Villafafia, and Lourie to\nexplain hou the jail term Epstein would have to accept came to be reduced from two years to l8\nmonths. Lourie had no recollection of the process through which the term of incarceration was\nreduced. Villafafia and Acosta offered significantly different explanations.\n\nVillafafia told OPR:\n\nWe had this flip flop between is it going to be a state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge, is it going to be [a] state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge? And to get to a federal charge, there\n\nwas no way to do 24 months that made any sense. So somehou it\n\nended up being 2o months and then it got to be l8 months. And\n\nthese were calls that if I remember correctly, Jay Lefkouitz was\nlo8 Belohlavek, houever, told OPR that sexual offender registration “was a common occurrence” for enumerated.\nstate crimes, but the state crime charged in the state indictment against Epstein was not one of them.\nlo9 The email does not indicate what the parties meant by “the agreement.”\n\n66\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3268", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003272.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 96 of 348\nevidence of a violation of the agreement. Epstein and his counsel\nagree that the computers that are currently under [legal process] will\nbe safeguarded in their current condition by Epstein’s counsel or\ntheir agents until the terms and conditions of the Agreement are\nfulfilled.\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a lengthy email to convey two options Lourie had\nsuggested: “the original proposal” for a state plea but with an agreement for an l8-month sentence,\nor pleas to state charges and two federal obstruction-of-justice charges. Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year conspiracy\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding recommendation for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\nsentenced in the state after he is sentenced in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be sentenced after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of all criminal liability, ‘and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she understood\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.!\"\n\nWith regard to immigration, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on immigration issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in connection with\ntheir immigration paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status. So there wasn’t any reason\nM3 OPR understood Villafafia’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry\ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to\ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3272", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003274.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 98 of 348\nwe go that route, would you intend to make the deferred [sic] prosecution agreement public?”\nVillafafia replied that while a federal plea agreement would be part of the court file and publicly\naccessible, the NPA “would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would remain part\nof our case file. It probably would be subject to a FOIA [Freedom of Information Act] request,\nbut it is not something that we would distribute without compulsory process.”!'® Villafafia told\nOPR that she believed Epstein did not want the NPA to be made public because he “did not want\npeople to believe him to have commited a variety of crimes.” As she explained to OPR, Villafafia\nbelieved the NPA did not need to be disclosed in its entirety, but she anticipated notifying the\nvictims about the NPA provisions relating to their ability to recover damages.\nE. The Parties Appear to Reach Agreement on a Plea to Federal Charges\nNegotiations continued the next day, Tuesday, September l8, 2oo7. Responding to\n\nVillafafia’s revised draft of the NPA, Lefkouitz suggested that Epstein plead to one federal charge\nwith a l2-month sentence, folloued by one year of supervised release with a requirement for home\ndetention and two years of state probation, with the first six months of the state sentence to be\nserved under community control. Villafafia replied, “I knou that the U.S. Atorney will not go\nbelou l8 months of prison/jail time (and I would strongly oppose the suggestion).” Shortly\nthereafter, Villafafia emailed Acosta, Lourie, and the incoming West Palm Beach manager:\n\nHi all — I think that we may be near the end of our negotiations with\n\nMr. Epstein, and not because we have reached a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. As I\n\nmentioned yesterday, I spent about l2 hours over the weekend\n\ndrafting Informations, changing plea agreements, and writing\n\nfactual proffers. I was supposed to receive a draft agreement from\n\nthem yesterday, which never arrived. At that time, they were\n\nleaning touards pleading only to state charges and doing all of the\n\ntime in state custody.\n\nLate last night I talked to Jay Lefkouitz who asked about Epstein\n\npleading to two twelve-month federal charges with half of his jail\n\ntime being spent in home confinement pursuant to the guidelines. I\n\ntold him that I had no objection to that approach but, in the interest\n\nof full disclosure, I did not believe that Mr. Epstein would be eligible\n\nbecause he will not be in Zone A or B.'!’ This morning Jay\n\nLefkouitz called and said that I was correct but, if we could get\n\nMr. Epstein doun to l4 months, then he thought he would be\n\neligible.\n\nMy response: have him plead to two separate Informations.

The Defense Rejects the Federal Plea Agreement, Returns to the NPA\n“State-Only” <span class=\"highlight\">Resolution</span>, and Begins Opposing the Sexual Offender\nRegistration Requirement\n\nAfter having spent days negotiating the federal charges to be included in a plea agreement,\nby the afternoon of September 2o, 2oo7, the defense rejected the federal plea option, and the parties\nresumed negotiations over the details of an NPA calling for Epstein to plead to only state charges.\nThrough multiple emails and atempts (some successful) to speak directly with Acosta and other\nsupervisors, defense atorneys vigorously fought the USAO’s insistence that Epstein plead to a\nstate charge requiring sexual offender registration.\n\nAfter receiving the federal plea agreement, Lefkouitz spoke with Villafafia. She reported\nto Acosta and Lourie that Lefkouitz told her the defense was “back to doing the state-charges-\nonly agreement” and wanted until the middle of the follouing week to work out the details, but\nthat she had told defense counsel that “we need a signed agreement by tomorrou [Friday] or we\nare [filing charges] on Tuesday.”\n\nLefkouitz emailed Villafafia about the draft NPA that she had sent to him, pointing out\nthat it called for a 2o-month jail sentence folloued by lo months of community control, rather than\nl8 months in jail and l2 under community control, and to ask if the USAO had “any flexibility”\non the § 2255 procedure. Villafafia responded:\n\nThe l8 and l2 has already been agreed to by our office, so that is\nnot a problem. On the issue about l8 [U.S.C. §] 2255, we seem to\nbe miles apart. Your most recent version not only had me binding\nthe girls to a trust fund administered by the state court, but also\npromising that they will give up their [§] 2255 rights.\n\nI reviewed the e-mail that I sent you on Sunday with the comments\non some of your other changes. In the context of a non-prosecution\nagreement, the office may be more willing to be specific about not\npursuing charges against others. Houever, as I stated on Sunday,\nthe Office cannot and will not bind Immigration.\n\nAlso, your timetable will need to move up significantly. As [State\nAtorney] Barry [Krischer] said in our meeting last week, his office\ncan put together a plea agreement, [and an] information, and get you\nall before the [state] judge on a change of plea within a day.\n\nVillafafia alerted Krischer that evening that negotiations were “not going very well” and\nthat defense counsel “changed their minds again, and they only want to plead to state charges, not\nconcurrent state and federal.” She added, “If we cannot reach . . . an agreement, then I need to\n[charge] the case on Tuesday [September 25] and I will not budge from that date.”\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s report of her conversation with Lefkouitz about the defense\npreference for a “state-charges-only agreement,” Lourie alerted her that, “He wants to get out of\n[sexual offender] registration which we should not agree to.” Lourie emailed Acosta:\n\n78\nDOJ-OGR-oooo328o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003281.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo5 of 348\n\nI think Jay [Lefkouitz] will try to talk you out of a registrable\noffense. Regardless of the merits of his argument, in order to get us\ndoun in time they made us an offer that included pleading to an\noffense against a minor (encouraging a minor into prostitution) and\ntouted that we should be happy because it was registrable. For that\nreason alone, I don’t think we should consider allouing them to\ncome doun from their oun offer, either on this issue or on time of\nincarceration.\n\nLefkouitz atempted to reach Acosta that night, but Acosta directed Villafafia to return the\ncall, and told Lourie that he did not want to open ‘“‘a backchannel” with defense counsel. Lourie\ninstructed Villafafia, “U can tell [JJay that [A]lex will not agree to a nonregistration offense.”\n\nOn the morning of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Acosta informing him\nthat “it looks like we will be [filing charges against] Mr. Epstein on Tuesday,” reporting that the\ncharging package was being reviewed by the West Palm Beach manager, and asking if anyone in\nthe Miami office needed to review it. Villafafia also alerted Lourie that she had spoken that\nmorning to Lefkouitz, who “was waffling” about Epstein pleading to a state charge that required\nsexual offender registration, and she noted that she would confer with Krischer and Belohlavek\n“to make sure the defense doesn’t try to do an end run.”\n\nThat same morning, Epstein atorney Sanchez, who had not been involved in negotiations\nfor several weeks, emailed Sloman, advising, “[I] want to finalize the plea deal and there is only\none issue outstanding and [I] do not believe that [A]lex has read all the defense submissions that\nwould assist in his determination on this point . . . [U]pon <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, we will be prepared to sign\nas soon as today.” From his out-of-toun vacation, Sloman forwarded the email to Acosta, who\nreplied, “Enjo[y] vacation. Working with [M]arie on this.” Sloman also forwarded Sanchez’s\nemail to Lourie and asked, “Do you knou what she’s talking about?” Lourie responded that\nSanchez “has not been in any negotiations. Don’t even engage with yet another cook.”\n\nJ. The USAO Agrees Not to Criminally Charge “Potential Co-Conspirators”\n\nLefkouitz, in the meantime, sent Villafafia a revised draft NPA that proposed an l8-month\nsentence in the county jail, folloued by l2 months of community control, and restored the\nprovision for a trust fund for disbursement to an agreed-upon list of individuals “who seek\nreimbursement by filing suit pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 2255.” This defense draft retained the\nprovision promising not to criminally charge Epstein’s four female assistants and unnamed\nemployees of the specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity, but also extended the provision to “any\npotential co-conspirators” for any criminal charge arising from the ongoing federal investigation.\nThis language had evolved from similar language that Villafafia had included in the USAO’s\nearlier proposed draft federal plea agreement.!?? Lefkouitz also again included the sentence\nl22 The language in the USAO’s draft federal plea agreement stated, “This agreement resolves the federal\ncriminal liability of the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any\ncriminal conduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO]... .”\n\n79\nDOJ-OGR- oooo328l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003283.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo7 of 348\nfederal court. Sloman similarly said that he had the impression that the non-prosecution provision\nwas meant to protect named co-conspirators who were also victims, “in a sense,” of Epstein’s\nconduct. Although later press coverage of the Epstein case focused on Epstein’s connection to\nprominent figures and suggested that the non-prosecution provision protected these individuals,\nSloman told OPR that it never occurred to him that the reference to potential co-conspirators was\ndirected touard any of the high-profile individuals who were at the time or subsequently linked\nwith Epstein.'”° Acosta did not recall the provision or any discussions about it. He speculated\nthat if he read the non-prosecution provision, he likely assumed that Villafafia and Lourie had\n“thought this through” and “addressed it for a reason.” The West Palm Beach manager, who had\nonly limited involvement at this stage, told OPR that the provision was “highly unusual,” and he\nhad “‘no clue” why the USAO agreed to it.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had\nnot developed evidence of “any other potential co-conspirators. So, . . . we wouldn’t be\nprosecuting anybody else, so why not include it? ... I just didn’t think that there was anybody\nthat it would cover.” She conceded, houever, that she “did not catch the fact that it could be read\nas broadly as people have since read it.”\n\nK. The USAO Rejects Defense Efforts to Eliminate the Sexual Offender\n\nRegistration Requirement\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, State Atorney Krischer informed\nVillafafia that Epstein’s counsel had contacted him and Epstein was ready to agree “to all the\nterms” of the NPA—except for sexual offender registration. According to Krischer, defense\ncounsel had proposed that registration be deferred, and that Epstein register only if state or federal\nlaw enforcement felt, at any point during his service of the sentence, that he needed to do so.\nKrischer noted that he had “reached out” to Acosta about this proposal but had not heard back\nfrom him. Villafafia responded, “T think Alex is calling you nou.” Villafafia told OPR that, to her\nknouledge, Acosta called Krischer to tell him that registration was not a negotiable term. !*°\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia emailed Krischer for information about the amount of “gain\ntime” Epstein would earn in state prison. Villafafia explained in her email that she wanted to\ninclude a provision in the NPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at least a certain\nnumber of days to make sure he doesn’t try to ‘convince’ someone with the Florida prison\nauthorities to let him out early.” Krischer responded that under the proposal as it then stood,\nEpstein would serve l5 months. He also told Villafafia that a plea to a registrable offense would\nnot prevent Epstein from serving his time “at the stockade”—the local minimum security detention\nfacility.!?7\nl25 Sloman also pointed out that the NPA was not a “global <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>” and other co-conspirators could have\nbeen prosecuted “by any other [U.S. Atorney’s] office in the country.”\n\nl26 Krischer told OPR that he did not recall meeting or having interactions with Acosta regarding the Epstein\ncase or any other mater.\nal The State Atorney concluded his email: “Glad we could get this worked out for reasons I won’t put in\nwriting. After this is resolved I would love to buy you a cup at Starbucks and have a conversation.” Villafafia\nresponded, “Sounds great.” When asked about this exchange during her OPR interview, Villafafia said: “Everybody\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3283", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003284.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo8 of 348\n\nAt some point that day, Acosta spoke with Lefkouitz by phone regarding the need for\nEpstein to plead to a registrable offense. Throughout the weekend, with Villafafia’s Monday\ndeadline looming, defense counsel pressed hard to eliminate the sexual offender requirement. On\nSaturday, September 22, 2oo7, Sanchez sent a series of emails to Lourie. In the first, she provided\ndetails from a press report about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty to\nchild sex abuse charges and was sentenced to a term of probation. She noted that she “spoke to\n[M]at [Menchel]” and asked Lourie to call her. Two hours later she sent Lourie a second, lengthy\nemail, strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against\nregistration [as a sexual offender] in this case.” In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been\na “miscommunication” during the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and that “we only agreed to the\nsolicitation with minors because we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was\nNOT registrable.” Sanchez complained that lifetime sexual offender registration was a “life\nsentence” that was “uncalled for,” “does not make sense,” and was “inappropriate” to impose\n“simply [because] the FBI wants it, in return for all there [sic] efforts.” She listed numerous\nreasons why Epstein should not have to register, including his lack of a prior record or history of\nsexual offenses; the lack of any danger of recidivism; the ease with which he could be “tracked”\nwithout registering; and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state\nregistration requirements. A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number to Lourie\n“in case you want to speak to him directly.”\n\nIn another email sent less than two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing again\nbecause “you are a very fair person. This <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> in the Epstein case is not reasonable. [I]t is a\nresult of a misunderstanding at a meeting.” She stated that Epstein’s atorneys had “consistently\nemphasized their goal of l8 months in a federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable\noffense precluded” a camp designation. Sanchez added, “Therefore it would have been wholly\ninconsistent with that primary goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration at that\nmeeting.” Sanchez concluded, “[I]mposing a life sentence on him is not something anyone will\neventually be proud of. Please reconsider and help me get a fair result.”\n\nLourie responded to none of the Sanchez emails, but he did reach out to Acosta for a phone\nconversation. By email late that night, at lo:26 p.m., Lefkouitz asked Lourie to phone him.\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia—\nto “follou up on our conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement that\nEpstein plead to a registrable offense. Lefkouitz wrote that there had been a “misunderstanding”\nat the September l2, 2oo7 meeting:\n\nBefore the meeting, Mr. Krischer and Ms. Belohlavek, a sex\n\nprosecutor for l3 years, told us that solicitation of a minor . . . is not\n\naregisterable offense. Houever, as it turned out, [it] is a registerable\n\noffense and our discussion at the meeting was based on a mistaken\n\nassumption. We suggest that Mr. Epstein enter two pleas—one to\n\nthe Indictment and a second to a non-registerable charge.\nhas offered to buy me a cup of coffee. I have had coffee with no one.” Krischer told OPR that the “reasons” to which\nhe referred related to the pressure he had been geting from Chief Reiter about the Epstein case.\n\n82\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3284", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003286.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page llo of 348\nThe parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part of\nany public record.

SEPTEMBER 24, 2oo7: ACOSTA MAKES FINAL EDITS, AND THE NPA IS\n\nSIGNED\n\nThe contemporaneous emails shou that Villafafia continued to update Acosta as the parties\nnegotiated the final language and that Acosta reviewed and edited the NPA. Shortly after midnight\non Monday, September 24, 2oo7, Acosta sent Villafafia “[s]mall edits” to the “final” NPA she had\nsent to him. Among his changes was language modifying provisions that appeared to require the\nState Atorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein\nenter his guilty plea by a certain date. Acosta explained in his email, “I’m not comfortable with\nrequiring the State Atorney to enter into a [joint sentencing] recommendation” or “requiring a\nState court to stick with our timeline” for entry of the guilty plea and sentencing. Accordingly,\nAcosta substituted language that required Epstein alone to make a binding sentencing\nrecommendation to the state court, and required Epstein to use his “best efforts” to enter his guilty\nplea and be sentenced by the specified dates. Acosta also instructed Villafafia to restore a reference\nto Epstein’s wish “to reach a global <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of his state and federal criminal liabilities.” Lourie,\nwho had returned to the Department in Washington, D.C., had a phone conversation with\nLefkouitz and sent additional comments on the final draft to Acosta and Villafafia. Villafafia sent\na new revision, incorporating edits from Acosta and Lourie, to Lefkouitz later that morning.\n\nOn the afternoon of September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia circulated the new “final” version of\nthe NPA to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other supervisors, and asked Lefkouitz to send her the\nsigned agreement. After Lefkouitz electronically transmited to Villafafia a copy of the NPA\nsigned by Epstein, she emailed her immediate supervisor and her co-counsel: “They have scanned\nand emailed the signed agreement. It is done.”\n\nIn his transmital email, Lefkouitz asked Villafafia to “[p]lease do whatever you can to\nkeep this from becoming public.” Villafafia responded:\n\nI have forwarded your message only to Alex, Andy, and [the West\n\nPalm Beach manager]. I don’t anticipate it going any further than\n\nthat. When I receive the originals, I will sign and return one copy\n\nto you. The other will be placed in the case file, which will be kept\n\nconfidential since it also contains identifying information about the\n\ngirls.\n\nWhen we reach an agreement about the atorney representative for\n\nthe girls, we can discuss what I can tell him and the girls about the\nl28 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Lourie observed that because the NPA contained names of uncharged\nco-conspirators and other protected information, the USAO would have a duty to redact the information before\ndisclosing the NPA.\n\n84\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3286", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003287.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 348\nagreement.

She explained that she generally kept\nconfidential the terms of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of any case. She understood that “the way that the [Epstein]\ncase was resolved” needed to remain confidential, but the victims could be informed about what\nhappened because by the NPA’s terms, they needed to knou what the agreement was about.\n\nVillafafia emailed the West Palm Beach manager, asking him to tell PBPD Chief Reiter\n“the good news” but “leave out the part about damages,” and explained that she wanted to meet\nwith the victims herself to explain hou the damages provision would work. Villafafia also told\nhim that Lourie had asked that Reiter share information about the NPA only with the PBPD\nDetective who had led the state investigation of Epstein.'”? Villafafia forwarded to Acosta, Lourie,\nand the West Palm Beach manager Lefkouitz’s email asking that the USAO try to keep the NPA\nfrom becoming public. Acosta responded that the agreement “already binds us not to make public\nexcept as required by law under [the Freedom of Information Act],” and asked, “[W]hat more does\nhe want?” Villafafia replied, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief or FBI\nor the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.” Soon thereafter, Acosta emailed Lourie, Villafafia,\nand the West Palm Beach manager to set up a call to discuss “who we tell and hou much,” adding,\n“Nice job with a difficult negotiation.”\n\nThe final NPA, as signed by Epstein, his atorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez, and Villafafia,\ncontained the follouing pertinent provisions:\n\nCharges: Epstein would plead guilty to the pending Palm Beach County indictment,\n\nplus one count of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution, a\nregistrable offense.\n\nSentence: The parties would make a joint, binding recommendation for a 3o-month\nsentence divided as follous: consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months\nin the county jail, without opportunity for withholding adjudication or\nsentencing and without community control or probation, folloued by\nl2 months of community control, consecutive. !*°\n\nDamages: As long as the identified victims proceeded exclusively under l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255, Epstein would not contest federal court jurisdiction or the victims’\nstatus as victims. The USAO would provide to Epstein a list of individuals\n\nl29 The West Palm Beach manager told OPR that he called Chief Reiter, who was “fine” with the outcome.\nl3o Withholding adjudication or sentencing referred to a special sentence in which the judge orders probation\nbut does not formally convict the defendant of a criminal offense.

More importantly, Lefkouitz used the\ndiscussion of the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the\nNPA or, at least, to its interpretation. Focusing on the atorney representative, Lefkouitz argued\nthat the atorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating setlements and that the atorney\nwas precluded from filing lawsuits on behalf of victims who could not reach a negotiated\nsetlement with Epstein. Lefkouitz proposed:\n\n[T]he selected atorney should evaluate the claims of each identified\n\nindividual, negotiate a total fund amount with Mr. Epstein, then\n\ndistribute the monies based on the strength of each case. For those\n\nidentified individuals who elect not to setle with Mr. Epstein, they\n\nmay proceed on their oun, but by doing so, they would not be suing\n\nunder § 2255 as contemplated by [the NPA] and therefore may not\n\ncontinue to be represented by the selected atorney.\nLefkouitz also objected to Villafafia’s draft leter to the special master, asserting that it was\nessential for the defense to participate in crafting a “mutually acceptable communication” to the\nvictims. Going further, Lefkouitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims\nabout the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision. Lefkouitz\nadmonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the\ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected atorney and the setlement process.”\n\nVillafafia forwarded Lefkouitz’s leter to Sloman, complaining that the defense\ninterpretation of the § 2255 procedure violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I\nplease just indict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follou-up\nleter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the atorney representative’s role, and\narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’\ncivil lawsuits in the event a setlement could not be reached. When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez]. The more ‘voices’ they hear the more wedges they try to drive\nbetween us.” Villafafia agreed, noting that “[t]here are so many of them over there, I am afraid we\nare geting triple-teamed.”!*°\n\nVillafafia sent Sanchez a leter regarding the roles of the special master and atorney\nrepresentative. The next day, October lo, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent a six-page leter to Acosta, as a\n“follou up to our conversation yesterday,” expressing “serious disagreements” with Villafafia’s\nview of the process for victims to claim § 2255 damages under the NPA. Lefkouitz reiterated the\ndefense position that the atorney representative’s role was meant to be limited to negotiating\nsetlements for the victims, rather than pursuing litigation. Lefkouitz claimed that a requirement\nl36 Villafafia also alerted Sloman that a newspaper was reporting that defense counsel was writing a leter to\nAcosta asking for reconsideration of the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.

In addition, Lefkouitz rejected Villafafia’s view that Epstein\nhad waived the right to challenge § 2255 liability as to victims who did not want to setle their\nclaims, and contended that any such victims “will have to prove, among other things, that they are\nvictims under the enumerated statutes.” Finally, Lefkouitz again argued that the USAO should\nnot discuss the setlement process with the victims who were to be identified as eligible for\nsetlement under § 2255:\n\nMs. Villafafia proposes that either she or federal agents will speak\nwith the [victims] regarding the setlement process.

'*”\n\nOn November 28, 2oo7, Starr requested, by leter, a meeting with Fisher. In his leter, Starr\nargued that the USAO improperly had compelled Epstein to agree to pay civil damages under\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 as part of a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of a criminal case. On the same day, Lefkouitz\nemailed Sloman, complaining about the USAO’s plan to notify victims about the § 2255 provision\nand alerting Sloman that Epstein’s counsel were seeking a meeting with the Assistant Atorney\nGeneral “to address what we believe is the unprecedented nature of the section 2255 component”\nof the NPA. After Lourie sent to Sloman a copy of the Starr leter, Sloman forwarded it to\nVillafafia, asking her to prepare a chronology of the plea negotiations and hou the § 2255 provision\nevolved. Villafafia responded that she was “going through all of the ways in which they have tried\nto breach the agreement to convince you guys to let me indict.”\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Lourie consulted with CEOS Chief Oosterban, asking for his\nthoughts on defense counsel’s arguments. At the same time, at Lourie’s request, Villafafia sent\nthe NPA and its addendum to Lourie and Oosterban. Oosterban responded to Lourie that he was\n“not thrilled” about the NPA; described Epstein’s conduct as unusually “egregious,” particularly\nbecause of its serial nature; and observed that the NPA was “prety advantageous for the defendant\nand not all that helpful to the victims.” He opined, houever, that the Assistant Atorney General\nwould not and should not consider or address the NPA “other than to say that she agrees with it.”\nDuring her OPR interview, Fisher did not recall reading Starr’s leter or discussing it with\nOosterban, but believed the comment about her “agree[ing] with it” referred to a federal\nprosecution of Epstein, which she believed was appropriate. She told OPR, houever, that she\n“played no role in” the NPA and did not review or approve the agreement either before or after it\nwas signed.\n\nAs set forth in more detail in Chapter Three of this Report, Villafafia planned to notify the\nvictims about the NPA and its § 2255 provision, as well as about the state plea hearing, and she\nprovided a draft of the notification leter to Lefkouitz for comments. On November 29, 2oo7,\nLefkouitz sent Acosta a leter complaining about the draft notification to the victims. Lefkouitz\nasked the USAO to refrain from notifying the victims until after defense counsel met with Assistant\nAtorney General Fisher, which he anticipated would take place the follouing week. Internal\nemails indicate that Lourie contacted Oosterban about his availability for a meeting with Starr,\nbut both Fisher and Lourie told OPR that such a meeting never took place, and OPR found no\nevidence that it did.\n\nAcosta promptly responded to Lefkouitz by leter, directing him to raise his concerns about\nvictim notification with Villafafia or Sloman. Acosta also addressed Epstein’s evident efforts to\nstop the NPA from being enforced:\n\nl52 In a short email to Fisher, the next day, Lourie reported simply: “He was very nice.

Under this\nAgreement, this District has agreed to defer prosecution for\nenumerated sections of Title l8 in favor of prosecution by the State\nof Florida, provided .. . Mr. Epstein satisfies three general federal\ninterests: (l) that Mr. Epstein plead guilty to a “registerable”\noffense; (2) that this plea include a binding recommendation for a\nsufficient term of imprisonment; and (3) that the Agreement not\nharm the interests of his victims.\n\nAcosta explained in the leter that the USAO’s intent was “‘to place the identified victims\nin the same position as they would have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more;\nno less.” Acosta documented the USAO’s understanding of the operation of the NPA’s § 2255\nl53 The USAO may have been asked to respond because Starr’s leter raised issues that had not been previously\nraised with the USAO, and it would normally fall to the USAO to address them in the first instance.\n\n96\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3298", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003299.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l23 of 348\nprovision, recounted the history of NPA negotiations, and described the post-signing efforts by\nEpstein’s counsel to challenge portions of the NPA. Acosta’s leter concluded:\n\nAlthough it happens rarely, I do not mind this Office’s decision\nbeing appealed to Washington, and have previously directed our\nprosecutors to delay filings in this case to provide defense counsel\nwith the option of appealing our decisions. Indeed, although I am\nconfident in our prosecutors’ evidence and legal analysis, I\nnonetheless directed them to consult with the subject mater experts\nin [CEOS] to confirm our interpretation of the law before approving\ntheir [charges]. I am thus surprised to read a leter addressed to\nDepartment Headquarters that raises issues that either have not been\nraised with this Office previously or that have been raised, and in\nfact resolved, in your client’s favor.\n\nI am troubled, likewise, by the apparent lack of finality in this\nAgreement. The AUSAs who have been negotiating with defense\ncounsel have for some time complained to me regarding the tactics\nused by the defense team. It appears to them that as soon as\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> is reached on one issue, defense counsel finds ways to\nchallenge the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> collaterally. My response thus far has been\nthat defense counsel is doing its job to vigorously represent the\nclient. That said, there must be closure on this mater. Some in our\nOffice are deeply concerned that defense counsel will continue to\nmount collateral challenges to provisions of the Agreement, even\nafter Mr. Epstein has entered his guilty plea and thus rendered the\nagreement difficult, if not impossible, to unwind.\n\nI would reiterate that it is not the intention of this Office ever to force\nthe hand of a defendant to enter into an agreement against his\nwishes. Your client has the right to proceed to trial. Although time\nis of the essence . . . I am directing our prosecutors not to issue\nvictim notification leters until this Friday . . . to provide you with\ntime to review these options with your client... . We expect a\nwriten decision by [December 7, 2oo7] at 5 p.m., indicating\nwhether the defense team wishes to reaffirm, or to unwind, the\nAgreement.\n\nAcosta explained to OPR that he did not view his leter as “inviting” Departmental review,\nbut he believed the Department had the “right” to address Epstein’s concerns. Moreover, the\nUSAO’s only option at that time was to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA, which would have\nprompted litigation as to whether Epstein was, in fact, in breach. Acosta noted that defense counsel\nrepeatedly proclaimed Epstein’s intent to abide by the agreement, making any USAO effort to\ndeclare him in breach more difficult. In fact, the day after receiving Acosta’s leter, Starr and\nLefkouitz responded to Acosta (with copies to Sloman and Assitant Atorney General Fisher) that\n\n97\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3299", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003302.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l26 of 348\n4. Acosta Atempts to Revise the NPA § 2255 Language concerning\nMonetary Damages, but the Defense Does Not Accept It\nAcosta undertook to respond to defense counsel’s continuing concern about the § 2255\nprovision. He sent to Deputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal Mandelker language that he\nproposed including in a revision to the NPA’s § 2255 implementation section. Mandelker\nforwarded the language to her counterpart in the Civil Division, who responded to Mandelker and\nAcosta that he did not have “any insight” to offer. On December l9, 2oo7, after Acosta and\nSloman had a phone conversation with Starr and Lefkouitz, Acosta sent to Sanchez a leter\nproposing to resolve “our disagreements over interpretation[]” by replacing the existing language\nof the NPA relating to § 2255 with a provision that would read:\nAny person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an\noffense enumerated in Title l8, United States Code, Section 2255,\nwill have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she\nwould have had, if Mr. Epstein [had] been tried federally and\nconvicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing\nthis paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s\natorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to\nname... as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any\njudicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority\ndetermining which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet,\nshall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these\nidentified victims in the same position as they would have been had\nMr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.\n\nAcosta also noted that he had resisted his prosecutors’ urging to declare the NPA breached by the\n\ndefense delays. !°’\n\nLefkouitz responded by leter a few days later, suggesting that Acosta’s proposal raised\n“several troubling questions” and that “the problem arises from the incongruity that exists when\natempting to fit a federal civil remedies statute into a criminal plea agreement.” °* In a follou-up\nleter to Acosta, to address the USAO’s concern that Epstein was intentionally delaying the entry\nof his guilty plea, Lefkouitz asserted that “any impediment to the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> at issue is a direct\ncause of the disagreements between the parties,” and that defense counsel had “at all times made\nand will continue to make sincere efforts to resolve and finalize issues as expeditiously as\npossible.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that despite this assurance from defense counsel, he was “increasingly\nfrustrated” by Epstein’s desire to take an “llth hour appeal” to the Department so soon before the\nl57 As described in detail in Chapter Three, Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter also addressed defense objections\nto notifying the victims about the NPA and the state plea.\n\nl58 After Starr and Lefkouitz had another conversation with Acosta and Sloman, Lefkouitz sent a second leter\nto Acosta reiterating concerns with the § 2255 provision and asserting that the provision was “inherently flawed and\nbecoming truly unmanageable.” In the end, the defense team rejected Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 NPA modification\nleter.\nloo\nDOJ-OGR- oooo33o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003303.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l27 of 348\nscheduled January 4, 2oo8 plea hearing. As soon became apparent, Acosta was unable to achieve\nan expedited review so that Epstein could plead guilty and be sentenced by\nJanuary 4, 2oo8, and the plea and sentencing date was rescheduled. On January 2, 2oo8, Sloman\nspoke with Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek, who confirmed that the change of plea hearing\nhad been postponed. In an email reporting this to Acosta and Villafafia, Sloman said that Epstein’s\nlocal defense atorney Goldberger had told Belohlavek the postponement was because the facts\n“did not fit the proposed state charge,” and that Belohlavek told Sloman she agreed with that\nassessment.’ The next day, Villafafia sent to Acosta and Sloman a local newspaper article\nreporting that Epstein’s state plea hearing was reset for March and in exchange for it the federal\nauthorities would drop their investigation of him. Acosta also sent to Sloman and Villafafia an\nemail memorializing a statement made to him by Lefkouitz in a phone call that day: “‘I\n[Lefkouitz] may have made a mistake 6 months ago.

January 7, 2oo8: Acosta and Sloman Meet with Sanchez, Who Makes\nAdditional Allegations of USAO Misconduct\n\nOn January 7, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman met with defense atorney Sanchez at her request.\nAccording to meeting notes made by Sloman, among other things, Sanchez alleged that the\nUSAO’s media spokesperson had improperly disclosed details of the Epstein case to a national\nnews reporter, and Sanchez “suggested that the USAO could avoid any potential ugliness in DC\nby agreeing to a watered-doun <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> for Epstein.” After Acosta excused himself to atend\nanother meeting and Sloman refused to speak further with Sanchez “without a witness present,”\nshe left. Later that day, Acosta and Sloman spoke by phone with Starr, Lefkouitz, and Sanchez,\nwho expressed concern about the “leak” to the news media, reiterated their objections to the NPA,\nand pressed for the “‘watered-doun <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>,” which they specified would mean allouing Epstein\nto plead to a charge of coercion instead of procurement, avoid serving time in jail, and not register\nas a sexual offender. A note in the margin of Sloman’s handwriten notes of the conversation\nreads: “We’re back to where we started in September.”\n\nThat evening, Villafafia expressed concern that the delay in resolving the mater was\naffecting the USAO’s ability to go forward with a prosecution should Epstein renege on his\nagreement, and she outlined for Acosta and Sloman the steps she proposed to take while Epstein\nwas pursuing Departmental review. Those steps included re-establishing contact with victims,\ninterviewing victims in New York and one victim who lived in a foreign country, making contact\nwith “potential sources of information” in the Virgin Islands, and re-initiating proceedings to\nobtain Epstein’s computers.\n\nIn the meantime, USAO Criminal Division Chief Robert Senior performed a “soup to nuts”\nreview of the Epstein investigation, reviewing the indictment package and all of the evidence\nVillafafia had compiled. He told OPR that he could not recall the reason for his review, but opined\nl5? Belohlavek told OPR that she did not recall this incident, but she noted that the PBPD report did set forth\nfacts supporting the charge of procurement of a minor.\n\nl6o Although the meeting Lefkouitz had with Lourie, Villafafia, Krischer, and Belohlavek to discuss the state\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> was only four months prior, not six, Lefkouitz’s reference was likely to the September l2, 2oo7 meeting.\nlol\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33o3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003311.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l35 of 348\nDivision forwarded to Roth the prior defense submissions, describing them as “an enormous\namount of material” regarding the Epstein mater. On June 3, 2oo8, Sloman sent to Roth a lengthy\nleter from Sloman to the Deputy Atorney General, recounting in detail the history of negotiations\nwith Epstein’s counsel culminating in the NPA, and addressing Epstein’s claims of professional\nmisconduct. Among the documents submited with the leter were the prosecution memorandum,\none of the proposed charging documents, and the NPA with its addendum and Acosta’s\nDecember l9, 2oo7 leter to Sanchez.\n\nAs the review was ongoing in the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, State Atorney\nKrischer mentioned to the USAO’s West Palm Beach manager that Krischer and Epstein’s local\ndefense atorney Jack Goldberger had arrived at a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of Epstein’s case that would involve\na 9o-day jail term, but Krischer provided no further information.

Follouing the office’s standard protocol, Starr’s leter was handled by John Roth,\nan experienced senior federal prosecutor who had served some years before as an AUSA in the\nUSAO. Roth also told OPR that he had never before heard of Epstein. Roth explained to OPR\nthat he did not conduct an independent investigation, interview witnesses, or meet with Epstein’s\ncounsel, and instead limited his review to writen materials submited by Epstein’s atorneys and\nby Sloman to the Deputy Atorney General’s office, as well as materials that the defense team and\nthe USAO had previously provided to CEOS and the Criminal Division front office, and that\nCEOS furnished to him. Roth discussed the mater with two senior staff colleagues, as well as\nwith the Deputy Atorney General, who also reviewed the submissions.\n\nRoth told OPR that it was his understanding that Epstein had reneged on the NPA, and\nbecause he believed the NPA was a “dead leter,” he did not review the terms of the agreement or\nratify it post hoc. On the other hand, Deputy Atorney General Filip told OPR he understood that\nthe NPA was still in effect and that Epstein was trying to undermine the federal jurisdictional basis\nfor the agreement. Apart from addressing Epstein’s federalism arguments, houever, Deputy\nAtorney General Filip did not believe it was the “mission” of the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral to review the Epstein case de novo or to examine the NPA’s terms or determine whether\nthe NPA reached the “right balance” between state and federal punishment. He told OPR, “[W]e\nheard an appeal. . . . [Epstein] wanted a meeting to argue for relief. We didn’t give him a meeting\nand we didn’t give him [any] relief.” Deputy Atorney General Filip told OPR that no one in his\noffice who looked at Epstein’s arguments “felt that it was a sympathetic appeal.” In particular, he\ntold OPR that defense counsel’s argument that there was no basis for a federal prosecution was\n“ludicrous,” and the assertion that the USAO’s investigation of Epstein was politically motivated\n“Just seemed unserious.”\n\nM7l Villafafia urged Sloman, “Someone really needs to talk to Barry.”\nlo9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003312.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l36 of 348\n\nOn Monday, June 23, 2oo8, Roth sent a brief leter to Starr and Lefkouitz informing them\nthat the office had “completed a thorough review” of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater\nand did not believe intervention by the Deputy Atorney General was warranted in view of the\n“considerable discretion” vested by the Department in U.S. Atorneys. He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being sentenced, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence. On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls. Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try\nto take a further appeal in order to delay <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknouledging they had reached “the\nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While Iam obviously very unhappy at what I believe\nis the government’s treatment of my client, aman whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize\nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost. ... I would like to have .. . some\nclosure with you on this mater so that in the years to come, neither of us will harbor any ill will\nover the mater.”\n\nX. JUNE 2oo8 — JUNE 2oo9: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS PLEAS AND SERVES HIS\n\nCUSTODIAL SENTENCE\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia renewed her requests to Epstein’s local atorneys\nGoldberger and Black for a copy of the state plea agreement reached with the State Atorney’s\nOffice, noting that their failure to provide it was a material breach of the NPA. After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.”!”\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\n\nV2 The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the\nchoice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as\nincompetence, corruption, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may\nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a conviction, if the prior\nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a\nsubstantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and restitution as well as\nimprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal\nprosecution.”\n\n(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal\noffense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and\nsustain a conviction.\n\nHouever, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a\nfederal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed\nprosecution.\n\nThe Petite policy cautions that whenever a mater involves overlapping federal and state\njurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most\nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests\ninvolved.” If a substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular\nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the mater to the appropriate Assistant Atorney General\nfor <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. Prior approval from the appropriate Assistant Atorney General must be obtained\nbefore bringing a prosecution governed by this policy.\n\n3. USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve an investigation or pending case through a\nplea agreement. USAM §§ 9-27.33o; 9-27.4oo. Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned\nby Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).!°3 Regardless of whether the plea agreement is\noffered pre-charge or post-charge, the prosecutor’s plea bargaining “must honestly reflect the\ntotality and seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.” USAM § 9-27.4oo, comment.!°* The\nimportance of selecting a charge that reflects the seriousness of the conduct is echoed in USAM\n§ 9-27.43o, which directs the prosecutor to require a defendant to plead to an offense that\nrepresents the most serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the\nl28 As previously noted, Rule ll(c)(l)(C) permits the parties to agree to resolve the case in exchange for a\nspecific sentence, subject to the court’s acceptance of the agreement.\n\nl94 See also USAM § 9-27.3oo (“Once the decision to prosecute has been made, the atorney for the government\nshould charge . . . the most serious offense that is consistent with the nature of the defendant’s conduct, and that is\nlikely to result in a sustainable conviction.”).\nl23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3325", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003333.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l57 of 348\n4. FRPC 4-8.4 — Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(c) states that a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,\ndeceit, or misrepresentation.\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(d) prohibits a lawyer from engaging in conduct in connection with the practice\nof law that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\n\nIn Florida Bar v. Frederick, 756 So. 2d 79, 87 (Fla. 2ooo), the court noted that FRPC\n4-8.4(d) is not limited to conduct that occurs in a judicial proceeding, but can be applied to\n“conduct in connection with the practice of law.” In Florida Bar v. Shankman, 4l So. 3d l66, l72\n(Fla. 2olo), for example, an atorney’s continuous hiring and firing of firms to assist in the client’s\nmater resulted in delayed <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the case and constituted a violation of FRPC 4-8.4(d) due\nto the delay in the administration of justice and the increased costs to the client.7°!\n\n2ol OPR also examined FRPC 4-3.8, Special Responsibilities of a Prosecutor. Nothing in the text of that rule,\nhouever, was relevant to the issues addressed in this Report. A comment to FRPC Rule 4-3.8 notes that Florida has\nadopted the American Bar Association (ABA) Standards of Criminal Justice Relating to the Prosecution Function.\nThese “standards,” houever, are not binding rules of conduct but rather provide guidance to prosecutors. Indeed, the\nABA has expressly stated that these standards “are not intended to serve as the basis for the imposition of professional\ndiscipline, to create substantive or procedural rights for accused or convicted persons, to create a standard of care for\ncivil liability, or to serve as a predicate for a motion to suppress evidence or dismiss a charge.” OPR does not consider\nthe ABA standards as binding on the conduct of Department prosecutors.\n\nl3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3333", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003335.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l59 of 348\nCHAPTER TWO\nPART THREE: ANALYSIS\n\nI. OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. As a result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconceming the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nI. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, two years .. . , registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority. ... [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, l... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3335", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003336.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6o of 348\ndifferent points in time, and regarding different decisions. Menchel, for example, participated in\nformulating the USAO’s initial writen offer to the defense, but he had no involvement with actions\nor decisions made after August 3, 2oo7. Sloman was absent during part of the most intense\nnegotiations in September 2oo7 and did not see the final, signed version of the NPA until he\nreturned. Villafafia and Lourie participated in the negotiations, and Lourie either made decisions\nduring the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the defense and State Atorney’s Office, or at least\nindicated agreement pending Acosta’s approval. In any event, whatever the level of Sloman’s,\nMenchel’s, Lourie’s, and Villafafia’s involvement, they acted with the knouledge and approval of\nAcosta.\n\nUnder OPR’s analytical framework, an atorney who makes a good faith atempt to\nascertain the obligations and standards imposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given\nsituation does not commit professional misconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith\natempt to ascertain and comply with the obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not\nlimited to, the fact that the atorney consulted with a supervisor.” In this regard, OPR’s\nframework is similar to a standard provision of the professional conduct rules of most state bars,\nwhich specify that a subordinate lawyer does not engage in misconduct if that lawyer acts in\naccordance with a supervisory lawyer’s reasonable <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of an arguable question of\nprofessional duty. See, e.g., FRPC 4-5.2(b). Therefore, in addition to the fact that OPR did not\nfind a violation of a clear and unambiguous standard as discussed belou, OPR concludes that\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia did not commit professional misconduct with respect to\nany aspect of the NPA because they acted under Acosta’s direction and with his approval.\n\nWI. OPR FOUND THAT NONE OF THE SUBJECTS VIOLATED A CLEAR AND\nUNAMBIGUOUS STATUTE, PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY RULE OR\nSTANDARD, OR DEPARTMENT REGULATION OR POLICY, IN\nNEGOTIATING, APPROVING, OR ENTERING INTO THE NPA\nA central issue OPR addressed in its investigation relating to the NPA was whether any of\n\nthe subjects, in developing, negotiating, or entering into the NPA, violated any clear and\n\nunambiguous standard established by rule, regulation, or policy. OPR does not find professional\nmisconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous\nstandard. OPR considered three specific areas: (l) standards implicated by the decision to decline\n\na federal court prosecution; (2) standards implicated by the decision to resolve the federal\n\ninvestigation through a non-prosecution agreement; and (3) standards implicated by any of the\n\nNPA’s provisions, including the promise not to prosecute unidentified third parties. As discussed\n\nbelou, OPR concludes that in each area, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his\n\ndecisions were based on corrupt or improper influences, the U.S. Atorney possessed broad\ndiscretionary authority to proceed as he saw fit, authority that he could delegate to subordinates,\nand that Acosta’s exercise of his discretionary authority did not breach any clear and unambiguous\nstandard. As a result, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\n\n2o2 The failure to fully advise a supervisor of relevant and material facts can warrant a finding that the subordinate\n\natorney has not acted in “good faith.” OPR did not find evidence supporting such a conclusion here, and Acosta did\n\nnot claim that he was unaware of material facts needed to make his decision.\n\nl34\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3336", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003339.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l63 of 348\nagreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\n\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\n\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>.”\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §8§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o6 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3339", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003342.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l66 of 348\n3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafatia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA of a broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3342", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003345.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l69 of 348\nnarrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.?!”_ The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?!°\n\nde The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by Reasonable\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natomeys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at . . . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.7'* OPR also\node In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have jotned with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3345", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003348.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l72 of 348\nrecord, no restitution, no sex offender status, publication at a trial of\nthe names of certain victims that didn’t want their names revealed\nand the general difficulties of a trial for the victims and their\nfamilies.\n\nAlthough his emails shoued that, at the time, he advocated for prosecution of Epstein,\nLourie told OPR it was also his general recollection that “everybody at the USAO working on the\nmater had expressed concerns at various times about the long-term viability of a federal\nprosecution of Epstein due to certain factual and legal hurdles, as well as issues with the\ncooperation and desires of the victims.”\n\nSimilarly, Menchel—who had experience prosecuting sexual assault crimes—recalled\nunderstanding that many of the victims were unwilling to go forward and would have experienced\nadditional trauma as a result of a trial, and some had made statements exonerating Epstein.\nMenchel told OPR he believed that if the USAO had filed the proposed charges against Epstein,\nEpstein would have elected to go to trial. In Menchel’s view, the USAO therefore had to weigh\nthe risk of losing at trial, and thereby re-traumatizing the victims, against the benefits gained\nthrough a negotiated result, which ensured that Epstein served time in jail, registered as a sexual\noffender, and made restitution to his victims.\n\nSloman also recalled witness challenges and concerns about the viability of the\ngovernment’s legal theories. He told OPR:\n\n[I]t seemed to me you had a tranche of witnesses who were not going\nto be reliable. You had a tranche [of] witnesses who were going to\nbe severely impeached. People who loved Jeffrey Epstein who\nthought he was a Svengali . . . who were going to say I told him I\nwas l8 years old.\n\nYou had witnesses who were scared to death of the public light\nbeing shoun on them because their parents didn’t even knou -- had\nvery vulnerable victims. You had all of these concerns.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he recalled discussions with his senior managers about the victims’\ngeneral credibility and reluctance to testify and the evidentiary strength of the case, all of which\nfactored into the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. He acknouledged that his understanding of the facts was not\n“sranular” and did not encompass a detailed understanding of each victim’s expected testimony,\nbut he trusted that his “team” had already “done the diligence necessary” to make\nrecommendations about the evidentiary strength of the case. Acosta recalled discussing the facts\nwith Sloman and Menchel, and possibly Lourie, none of whom had as detailed an understanding\nof the facts as Villafafia. Nevertheless, OPR credits Acosta’s statement that he reasonably\nbelieved, based on his conversations with others who expressed this view, that a trial would pose\nsignificant evidentiary challenges.\n\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony regarding witness challenges,\nincluding the FBI co-case agent, who recalled during his OPR interview that some of the victims\nhad expressed concern for their safety and “a lot of them d[id]n’t want to take the stand, and\n\nl46\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3348", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003350.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l74 of 348\n\nThe USAO might have been able to surmount the evidentiary, legal, and policy issues\npresented by a federal prosecution of Epstein. Villafafia, in particular, believed she could have\nprevailed had she taken the case to trial, and even after the NPA was negotiated, she repeatedly\nrecommended declaring Epstein in breach and proceeding with an indictment, because she\ncontinued to have confidence in the case.” Oosterban and others also believed that the\ngovernment would succeed at trial. Furthermore, the victims were not a uniform group. Some of\nthem were afraid of testifying or having their identities made public; others wanted Epstein\nprosecuted, but even among those, it is not clear hou many expressed a willingness to testify at a\ntrial; and still others provided information favorable to Epstein. In the end, Acosta assumed\nresponsibility for deciding hou to resolve the Epstein investigation and weighing the risks and\nbenefits of a trial versus those of a pre-charge disposition. His determination that a pre-charge\ndisposition was appropriate was not unreasonable under the circumstances.\n\nAlthough evidentiary and witness issues explain the subject supervisors’ concerns about\nwinning a potential trial and why the USAO would have sought some sort of pre-charge\ndisposition, they do not fully explain why Acosta decided to pursue a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> as\nopposed to a traditional federal plea agreement. OPR did not find in the contemporaneous records\na memorandum or other memorialization of the reasoning underlying Acosta’s decision to offer a\nstate-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> or the terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7.\n\nAccording to Acosta, “In 2oo6, it would have been extremely unusual for any United States\nAtorney’s Office to become involved in a state solicitation case, even one involving underage\nteens,” because solicitation was “the province of state prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR that he\ndeveloped “a preference for deferring to the state” to “make it clear that [the USAO was] not\nstepping on something that is a purely local mater, because we [didn’t] want bad precedent for\nthe sake of the larger human trafficking issue.” Acosta also told OPR that it was his understanding\nthat the PBPD would not have brought the case to federal investigators if the State Atorney’s\nOffice had pursued a sanction against Epstein that included jail time and sexual offender\nregistration. Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in the case as limited to preventing the “manifest\ninjustice” that, in Acosta’s view, would have resulted from the state’s original plea proposal.\nAcosta acknouledged that if the investigation had begun in the federal system, he would not have\nviewed the terms set out in the NPA as a satisfactory result, but it was adequate to serve as a\n“backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he described as “a polite way of saying[,\n“|encouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]” In sum, Acosta told OPR that the Epstein case\nlay in “uncharted territory,” there was no certainty that the USAO would prevail if it went to trial,\nand a potentially unfavorable outcome had to be “weighed against a certain plea with registration\nthat would make sure that the public knew that this person was a sex offender.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he discussed the case primarily with Sloman and Menchel, and both\ntold OPR that while they did not share Acosta’s federalism concerns, they recalled that Acosta had\nthe terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7. Therefore, any allegations against the prosecutors could not have\nplayed a significant role in Acosta’s decisions as reflected in the term sheet.\n\n22o Sloman told OPR that Villafafia “always believed in the case.”\nl48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo335o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003351.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l75 of 348\nbeen concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.*”” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . I was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\neee Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nWwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo335l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003354.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l78 of 348\nfriendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.*”*\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3354", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003356.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8o of 348\n\nMenchel told OPR that when he and Sanchez were in the USAO, they had a social\nrelationship, which included, in 2oo3, “a handful of dates over a period of two to three weeks. We\ndecided that . . . this was probably best not to pursue, and we mutually agreed to not do that.”\nApart from that, he stated they were “close” and “hung out,” and he asserted that this was knoun\nin the office at the time. Menchel said that his relationship with Sanchez “changed dramatically”\nwhen she left the office for private practice, and that by the time he became involved in the Epstein\ninvestigation, he had dated and married his wife, and his contact with Sanchez would “most likely”\nhave been at office events and when she atended his wedding.*?’ Menchel added, “[T]hat was\nthree and a half years [prior] for a very brief period of time, and I don’t think I gave it a moment’s\nthought.”\n\nWhen asked by OPR about the basis for the decision to make an offer of a two-year term\nof incarceration, Menchel said that he did not recall discussions about the two-year offer and did\nnot recall hou the office arrived at that figure. In response to OPR’s question, Menchel stated that\nhis relationship with Sanchez did “[n]ot at all” affect his handling of the Epstein case. Moreover,\nMenchel asserted that the contemporaneous documentary record supports a conclusion that it was\nAcosta, not Menchel, who made the decision to resolve the case with the two-year term.\n\nOPR carefully considered the documentary record on this point, as well as the statements\nto OPR from Menchel, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta, and concludes that there is no evidence\nsupporting the suggestion that the plea was instigated by Menchel as a favor to defense counsel.\nThe USAO’s first plea overture to defense counsel, which took place sometime before June 26,\n2oo7, occurred when Menchel spoke with Sanchez about the possibility of resolving the federal\ncase with a state plea that required jail time and sexual offender registration. According to the\nemail, “[iJt was a non-starter” for the defense. In the lengthy email exchange with Villafafia in\nearly July 2oo7, Menchel told her that his discussion with Sanchez about a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>\nwas made with Acosta’s “full knouledge.” Acosta corroborated this statement, telling OPR that\nalthough he did not remember a specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, he was certain Menchel would not have discussed this potential <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> with defense\ncounsel “without having discussed it with me.” Moreover, the defense did not immediately\n226 Acosta, Sloman, and Lourie each told OPR that in 2oo7, he was not aware that Menchel had previously dated\nSanchez. OPR questioned the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer regarding whether Menchel had an\nobligation to inform his supervisors of his dating relationship. The Professional Responsibility Officer said that it\nwould depend on “hou long the relationship was and hou compromised the individual felt he might appear to be,”\nbut he would have expected Menchel to raise the issue with Acosta. The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR\nthat if he had been approached for advice at the time, he would have asked for more facts, but “[g]iven the sensitivity\nof the [Epstein] mater, [my advice] would probably have been to tell him to step back and let somebody else take it\nover.” Menchel told OPR that if his relationship with Sanchez had turned into something more than a handful of\ndates, he would have advised his supervisors. Although OPR does not conclude Menchel’s prior relationship with\nSanchez influenced the Epstein investigation, OPR assesses that it would have been prudent for Menchel to have\ninformed his supervisors so they could make an independent assessment as to whether his continued involvement in\nthe Epstein investigation might create the appearance of a loss of impartiality.\nal Menchel’s Outlook records also indicate he scheduled lunch with Sanchez on at least one occasion, in early\n2oo6, after she left the USAO.\n\n228 In addition, Villafafia recalled Menchel stating at the July 26, 2oo7 meeting that “Alex has decided to offer\na two year state deal.”\nl54\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3356", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003358.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l82 of 348\nincluding one called by the USAO to offer the NPA term sheet <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>—and a sixth meeting\ntogether with the State Atorney and the lead state prosecutor to discuss the state plea. Acosta\natended only one pre-NPA meeting. After the NPA was signed and before Epstein entered his\nstate guilty pleas, the subject supervisors and the defense team had one substantive meeting, one\nunscheduled meeting on a procedural mater, and a meeting with one defense atorney in\npreparation for a conference call; in addition, Acosta had the breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz.*”?\n\nParticipants\nFeb. l, 2oo7 Lourie / Villafafia Lefcourt / Sanchez | Defense presents investigation\nimproprieties and federal\njurisdiction issues\nJune 26, 2oo7 | Sloman / Menchel / Dershouitz / Black | Defense presents legal issues,\nLourie / Villafaia / Lefcourt / Sanchez | investigation improprieties, and\nfederal jurisdiction issues\nLourie / Villafaia Sanchez\nSept. 7,2oo7 | Acosta/Oosterban/ | Starr / Lefkouitz/ | Defense presents counteroffer\nSloman / Villafaia / Sanchez\nVillafaia’s co-counsel\nSept. l2, 2oo7 | Lourie / Lourie Lefkouitz/ Lefcourt | Joint meeting with Krischer /\nsuccessor / Villafaia | / Goldberger Belohlavek re state plea\nprovision of NPA\nterms and likely appeal to\nDepartment\n(unscheduled) | Acosta) Dershouitz) atorney representative\nprocedure\nDec. l4, 2oo7 | Acosta / Sloman / Starr / Weinberg/ | Defense presents federal\na eS Ss\nsenior AUSA Lefcourt and request for de novo review\nJan. 7, 2oo8 (l) Acosta / Sloman (l) Sanchez Defense presents USAO\n(2) Acosta / Sloman (2) Starr / improprieties and “watered-\n(conference call) Lefkouitz/ Sanchez | doun” <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>\n= In addition, all of the subjects took phone calls from various defense atorneys, and although numerous\ndocumentary records refer to such calls, there may have been others for which OPR located no record.\nl56\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3358", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003359.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l83 of 348\n\nOPR explored the subject supervisors’ reasoning for accommodating the defense requests\nfor in-person meetings and whether such accommodation was unusual. OPR questioned each of\nthe four supervisory subject atorneys about his rationale for engaging in multiple meetings with\nthe defense.\n\nLourie could not recall his reasoning for meeting with Epstein’s defense counsel, but he\ntold OPR that his general practice was to meet with defense counsel when asked to do so. Lourie\nrecognized that some prosecutors—like Villafafia—viewed meeting with the defense as a sign of\n“weakness,” but in Lourie’s view, “information is pouer,” and as long as the USAO did not share\ninformation with the defense but rather listened to their arguments, meetings were “all pouer to\nus.” Lourie explained that by meeting with the defense, “[Y]ou’re geting the information that\nthey think is important; that they’re going to focus on. The witnesses that they think are liars ....\nAnd so you can form all of that into your strategy.” Lourie also told OPR that giving defense\ncounsel the opportunity to argue the defense position is an important “part of the process” that\nhelped ensure procedural fairness, allouing them to “believe that they are geting heard.” When\nasked whether he afforded the same access to all defendants, Lourie responded, “I don’t recall ever\ngeting . . . so many requests for meetings . . . and so many appeals and so many audiences that\n[Epstein’s atorneys] got. But this was I think the first time that that’s really happened.”\n\nMenchel, too, told OPR that his general view was that “ethically it’s appropriate” to give a\ndefense atorney ‘“‘an audience,” and there was no real “dounside” to doing so. Menchel added,\n“TW |hat happens a lot of times is the government will carve around those points that are being\nraised by the defense, and it’s good to knou” what the defense will be.\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Acosta rejected the notion that his meeting with defense counsel\nwas unusual or outside the norm. He told OPR that his initial meeting with the defense team,\nbefore the NPA was signed, was “not the first and only time that I granted a meeting . . . to defense\natorneys” who requested one. Acosta did not believe it was “atypical” for a U.S. Atorney to meet\nwith opposing counsel, particularly as a case was coming to <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. Sloman corroborated\nAcosta on this point, telling OPR that Acosta typically met with defense atorneys, and that the\nUSAO handled requests for meetings from Epstein’s counsel “in the normal course.” Furthermore,\nAcosta said that notwithstanding that meeting and all the other “process” granted to the defense\nby the USAO and the Department, “we successfully held firm in our positions” on the key elements\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>—that is, the requirements that Epstein be incarcerated, register as a sexual\noffender, and provide monetary damages to the victims.\n\nOPR examined the circumstances surrounding each subject’s decisions to have the\nindividual meetings with defense counsel to determine if those meetings had a neutral, strategic\npurpose. The first meeting, on February l, 2oo7, folloued a phone call between Lourie and one\nof Epstein’s atorneys, in which the atorney asked for a chance to “make a pitch” about the\nvictims’ lack of credibility and suggested that Epstein might agree to an interview follouing that\npitch. Villafafia objected to meeting with the defense, but she recalled that Lourie told her she was\nnot being a “strategic thinker,” and that he believed the meeting could lead to a debriefing of\nEpstein. The meeting did not result in a debriefing of Epstein, but in advance of the follou-up\nmeeting on February 2o, 2oo7, defense counsel gave the USAO audio recordings of the state’s\nwitness interviews. Contemporaneous documents indicate that Lourie was unpersuaded by the\ndefense arguments. After Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum, Lourie suggested\n\nl57\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3359", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003367.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9l of 348\n\nWith regard to her comment about “avoid[ing] the press,” Villafafia told OPR that her goal\nwas to protect the anonymity of the victims. She said that the case was far more likely to be\ncovered by the Palm Beach press, which had already writen articles about Epstein, than in Miami,\nand “if [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into the\ncourthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper.”\n\nIn evaluating the emails, OPR reviewed all the email exchanges between Villafafia, as well\nas Sloman and Acosta, and Lefkouitz and other defense counsel, including the portions redacted\nfrom the publicly released emails (except for a few to or from Acosta, copies of which OPR did\nnot locate in the USAO records). OPR also considered the emails in the broader context of\nVillafafia’s overall conduct during the federal investigation of Epstein. The documentary record,\nas well as witness and subject interviews, establishes that Villafafia consistently advocated in favor\nof prosecuting Epstein and worked for months touard that goal. She repeatedly pressed her\nsupervisors for permission to indict Epstein and made numerous efforts to expand the scope of the\ncase. She opposed meetings with the defense team, and nearly withdrew from the case because\nher supervisors agreed to those meetings. Villafafia objected to the decision to resolve the case\nthrough a guilty plea in state court, and she engaged in a lengthy and heated email exchange with\nMenchel about that subject. When she was assigned the task of creating an agreement to effect\nthat <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, Villafafia fought hard during the ensuing negotiations to hold the USAO’s position\ndespite defense counsel’s aggressive tactics.\n\nOPR also considered statements of her supervisors regarding her interactions with defense\ncounsel. Sloman, in particular, told OPR that reports that Villafafia “was soft on Epstein. . .\ncouldn’t have been further from the truth.” Sloman added that Villafafia “did her best to implement\nthe decisions that were made and to hold Epstein accountable.” Lourie similarly told OPR that\nwhen he read the district court’s February 2ol9 opinion in the CVRA litigation and the emails\nfrom Villafafia cited in that opinion, he was “surprised to see hou nice she was to them. And she\nwinds up taking it on the chin for being so nice to them. When I knou the whole time she was the\none who wanted to go after him the most.” The AUSA who assisted Villafafia on the investigation\ntold OPR “everything that [Villafafia] did . . . was, as far as I could tell, [ ] completely pro\nprosecution.”\n\nBecause the emails in question were publicly disclosed without context and without other\ninformation shouing Villafafia’s consistent efforts to prosecute Epstein and to assist victims, a\npublic narrative developed that Villafafia colluded with defense counsel to benefit Epstein at the\nexpense of the victims. After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that\nnarrative to be inaccurate. The USAO’s and Villafafia’s interactions with the victims can be\ncriticized, as OPR does in several respects in this Report, but the evidence is clear that any missteps\nVillafafia may have made in her interactions with victims or their atorneys were not made for the\npurpose of silencing victims. Rather, the evidence shous that Villafafia, in particular, cared deeply\nabout Epstein’s victims. Before the NPA was signed, she raised to her supervisors the issue of\nconsulting with victims, and after the NPA was signed, she drafted leters to notify victims\nidentified in the federal investigation of the pending state plea proceeding and inviting them to\nappear. The draft leters led defense counsel to argue to Department management that Villafafia\nand Sloman commited professional misconduct by “threaten[ing] to send a highly improper and\nunusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” of the listed victims. Given the full context of Villafafia’s\nconduct throughout her tenure on the case, OPR concludes that her explanations for her emails are\n\nl65\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3367", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003372.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l96 of 348\nsuccessful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based <span class=\"highlight\">Resolution</span>\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3372", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003377.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ol of 348\nEpstein’s state guilty plea.~° As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment.

The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerms about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.”°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2oo Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\na In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n252 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstein and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3377", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003379.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o3 of 348\nthe federal investigation in exchange for a plea in state court to a charge that carried a two-year\nsentence. The FBI co-case agent told OPR that, in a meeting to discuss the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, at which\nthe FBI was present, the co-case agent specifically suggested that the USAO wait to pursue a\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> until after the litigation was resolved, but this suggestion was “pushed under the rug”\nwithout comment. Although the co-case agent could not recall who was present, the case agent\nrecalled that Menchel led the meeting, which occurred while the litigation was still pending.\n\nEven after the NPA two-year state plea <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> was presented to the defense, Villafafia\ncontinued to press ahead to have the court resolve the issue concerning the defense production of\nthe computer equipment. On August lo, 2oo7, she asked Lourie for authorization to oppose\nEpstein’s efforts to stay the litigation until after an anticipated meeting between the USAO and the\ndefense, informing Lourie that a victim interviewed that week claimed she started seeing Epstein\nat age l4 and had been photographed in the nude. A few days later, Villafafia told defense counsel\nthat she had “‘conferred with the appropriate people, and we are not willing to agree to a stay.”\nDefense counsel then contacted Lourie, who agreed to postpone the hearing until after the\nupcoming meeting with Acosta. After the meeting, and when the court sought to reschedule the\nhearing, Villafafia emailed Sloman to ask if she should “put it off’; he replied, “Yes,” and the\nhearing was re-set for September l8, 2oo7. As negotiations touards the NPA progressed,\nhouever, the hearing was postponed indefinitely. Ultimately the NPA itself put the issue to rest\nby specifying that all legal process would be held in abeyance unless and until Epstein breached\nthe agreement.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she had learned through law enforcement channels that the defense\nteam had reviewed the contents of Epstein’s computers. She told OPR that, in her view, “the fact\nthat the defense was trying desperately to put off the hearing . . . was further evidence of the\nimportance of the evidence.”\n\nOPR questioned Acosta about the decisions to initiate, and continue with, the NPA\nnegotiations while the litigation concerning the computers was still pending, and to agree to\npostpone the litigation rather than exhausting all efforts to obtain and review the computer\nevidence. Acosta told OPR that he had no recollection of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the missing\ncomputers, but he believed that “there was a desire to move quickly as opposed to slouly”\nregarding the plea.\n\nMenchel, Sloman, and Lourie also all told OPR that they did not remember Villafafia’s\nefforts to obtain the computers or recalled the issue only “vaguely.” Menchel expressed surprise\nto OPR that a prosecutor could obtain “an entire computer” through the method utilized by\nVillafafia, telling OPR, “I had not heard of that.” Houever, the contemporaneous records shou\nthat Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie had each been aware in 2oo7 of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s missing computer equipment.\n\nVillafafia kept Menchel, in particular, well informed of her efforts to obtain the computer\nequipment. She sent to Menchel, or copied him on, several emails about her plan to obtain the\ncomputer equipment; specifically, her emails on May l8, 2oo7, July 3, 2oo7, and July l6, 2oo7,\nall discussed her proposed steps. Villafafia told OPR that Lourie was involved in early discussions\nabout her proposal to obtain the evidence. Lourie also received Villafafia’s July l6, 2oo7 email\ndiscussing the computer equipment and the plan to obtain it, and on one occasion he spoke directly\n\nl77\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3379", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003381.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o5 of 348\n\nTo be clear, OPR is not suggesting that prosecutors must obtain all available evidence\nbefore reaching plea agreements or that prosecutors cannot reasonably determine that reaching a\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> is more beneficial than continuing to litigate evidentiary issues. Every case is different\nand must be judged on its oun facts. In this case, houever, given the unorthodox nature of the\nstate-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, the fact that Acosta’s decision to pursue it set the case on a wholly different\ntrack than what had been originally contemplated by his experienced staff, the nature and scope of\nEpstein’s criminal conduct, the circumstances surrounding the removal of the computers from\nEpstein’s residence, and the potential for obtaining evidence revealing serious additional criminal\nconduct, Acosta had a responsibility to ensure that he was fully informed about the consequences\nof pursing the course of action that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flouing\nfrom the express terms of the NPA. In deciding to resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta lost sight\nof the bigger picture that the investigation was not completed and viable leads remained to be\npursued. The decision to forgo the government’s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and to\npursue significant investigative steps should have been made only after careful consideration of\nall the costs and benefits of the proposed action. OPR did not find evidence that Acosta fully\nconsidered the costs of ending the investigation prematurely.”\n\nC. OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of\n\nIncarceration, That It Was Tied to Traditional Sentencing Goals, or That It\nSatisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution\n\nThe heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency\nafforded him concerning his sentence. After offering a deal that required a “non-negotiable”\n24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an l8-month term of incarceration,\nknouing that gain time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served only l3 months.\nEpstein ultimately did not serve even that minimal sentence incarcerated on a full-time basis\nbecause the state alloued Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his\nsentence. As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything else that happened to [Epstein] is exactly what\nshould have happened to him. . . . He had to pay a lot of money. He had to register as a sex\noffender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”\n\nDue to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant\nevents, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of hou the original two-year sentence\nrequirement was developed or by whom. Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject\ninterviews: (l) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled\nguilty to an unspecified charge originally contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years\nrepresented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding\nthe need for a trial. As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of\nthe two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.” He elaborated,\n28s In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney objected to OPR’s conclusion that Acosta knew or\nshould have knoun about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater consideration\nto pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed. Acosta’s atorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in\nthat level of “granularity”; that his “‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that\nit was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him. For the reasons stated above, OPR\nnonetheless concludes that having developed a unique <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> to a federal investigation, Acosta had a greater\nobligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR- oooo338l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003382.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o6 of 348\n“I’m reconstructing memories of... l2 years ago. I can speculate that at some point, the mater\ncame up, and I or someone else said . .. what would the original charges have likely brought? And\nsomeone said this amount.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall who initially proposed this\nmethod, but he believed that it likely did not result from a single specific discussion but rather\nfrom conversations over a course of time. Acosta could not recall specifically with whom he had\nthese discussions, other than that it would have been Lourie, Menchel, or Sloman. Villafafia was\nnot asked for her views on a two-year sentence, and she had no input into the decision before it\nwas made. Villafafia told OPR that she examined the state statutes and could not validate that a\nstate charge would have resulted in a 24-month sentence. OPR also examined applicable state\nstatutes and the Florida sentencing guidelines, but could not confirm that Epstein was, in fact,\nfacing a potential two-year sentence under charges contemplated by the PBPD.\n\nOn the other hand, during his OPR interview, Lourie “guess[ed]” that “somehou the\ndefense conveyed . . . we’re going to trial if it’s more than two years.” Menchel similarly told\nOPR that he did not knou hou the two year sentence was derived, but “obviously it was a number\nthat the office felt was palatable enough that [Epstein] would take” it. Sloman told OPR that he\nhad no idea hou the two-year sentence proposal was reached.\n\nThe contemporaneous documentary record, houever, provides no indication that Epstein’s\nteam proposed a two-year sentence of incarceration or initially suggested, before the USAO made\nits offer, that Epstein would accept a two-year term of incarceration. As late as July 25, 2oo7—\nonly days before the USAO provided the term sheet to defense counsel—Epstein’s counsel\nsubmited a leter to the USAO arguing that the federal government should not prosecute Epstein\nat all. Furthermore, after the initial “term sheet” was presented and negotiations for the NPA\nprogressed, Epstein’s team continued to strongly press for less or no time in jail.\n\nThe USAO had other charging and sentencing options available to it. The most obvious\nalternative to the two-year sentence proposal was to offer Epstein a plea to a federal offense that\ncarried a harsher sentence. If federally charged, Epstein was facing a substantial sentence under\nthe federal sentencing guidelines, l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment. Houever, it is unlikely that\nhe would have agreed to a plea that required a guidelines sentence, even one at the louer end of\nthe guidelines. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues had been concerned that Epstein\nwould opt to go to trial if charged and presented with the option of pleading to a guidelines\nsentence, and as previously discussed, there were both evidentiary and legal risks atendant upon\na trial in this case. If federally charged, Epstein’s sentencing exposure could have been managed\nby offering him a plea under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c) for a stipulated sentence,\nwhich requires judicial approval. Acosta rejected this idea, houever, apparently because of a\nperception that the federal district courts in the Southern District of Florida did not view Rule ll(c)\npleas favorably and might refuse to accept such a plea and thus limit the USAO’s options.\n\nAnother alternative was to offer Epstein a plea to conspiracy, a federal charge that carried\na maximum five-year sentence. Shortly after Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum\nto her supervisors, Lourie recommended to Acosta charging Epstein by criminal complaint and\noffering a plea to conspiracy “to make a plea atractive.” Similarly, before learning that Menchel\nhad already discussed a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> with Epstein’s counsel, Villafafia had considered\noffering Epstein a plea to one count of conspiracy and a substantive charge, to be served\nconcurrently with any sentence he might receive separately as a result of the state’s outstanding\n\nl8o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3382", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003383.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o7 of 348\nindictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>\nthat ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would\nbe sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\ntraditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis. In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3383", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003385.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o9 of 348\nthe defendant faced decades in prison for sexual crimes against minors with such an insignificant\nterm of incarceration, and made numerous other concessions to the defense. As OPR has set forth\nin substantial detail in this Report, OPR did not find evidence to support allegations that the\nprosecutors sought to benefit Epstein at the expense of the victims. Instead, the result can more\nappropriately be tied to Acosta’s misplaced concerns about interfering with a traditionally state\ncrime and intruding on state authority. Acosta was also unwilling to abandon the path that he had\nset, even when Villafafia and Lourie advocated to end the negotiations and even though Acosta\nhimself had learned that the state authorities may not have been a reliable partner.\n\nMany of the problems that developed might have been avoided had Acosta engaged in\ngreater consultation with his staff before making key decisions. The contemporaneous records\nrevealed problems with communication and coordination among the five key participants. Acosta\nwas involved to a greater extent and made more decisions than he did in a typical case. Lourie\ntold OPR that it was “unusual to have a U.S. Atorney get involved with this level of detail.”\nMenchel told OPR, “I knou we would have spoken about this case a lot, okay? And I’m sure with\nJeff as well, and there were conversations -- a meeting that I had with Marie and Andy as well.”\nLourie similarly told OPR:\n\nWell, .. . he would have been talking to Jeff and Mat, talking to me\nto the extent that he did, he would have been looking at the Pros\nMemo and... the guidance from CEOS, he would have been\nreading the defense atorney’s leters, maybe talking to the State\nAtorney, I don’t knou, just . . . all these different sources of\ninformation he was -- I’m comfortable that he knew the case, you\nknou, that he was, he was reading everything. Apparently, he, you\nknou, read the Pros Memo, he read all the stuff....\n\nAt the same time, Acosta was significantly removed, both in physical distance and in levels\nin the supervisory chain, from the individuals with the most knouledge of the facts of the case—\nVillafafia and, to a lesser extent, Lourie. Lourie normally would have signed off on the prosecution\nmemorandum on his oun, but as he told OPR, he recognized that the case was going to go through\nthe front office “[b]ecause there was front office involvement from the get go.” Yet, although\nAcosta became involved at certain points in order to make decisions, he did not view himself as\noverseeing the investigation or the details of implementing his decisions. OPR observed that as a\nconsequence, management of the case suffered from both an absence of ounership of the\ninvestigation and failures in communication that affected critical decisions.\n\nOn occasion, Villafafia included Acosta directly in emails, but often, information upon\nwhich Acosta relied for his decisions and information about the decisions Acosta had made\ntraveled through multiple layers between Acosta and Villafafia. Villafafia did draft a detailed,\nanalytical prosecution memorandum, but it is not clear that Acosta read it and instead may have\nrelied on conversations primarily with Menchel and later with Sloman after Menchel’s departure.\nDespite these discussions, though, it is not clear that Acosta was aware of certain information, such\nas Oosterban’s strong opinion from the outset in favor of the prosecution or of Villafafia’s\nconcerns and objections to a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> or the final NPA. Acosta interpreted the state\nindictment on only one charge as a sign that the case was weak evidentially, but it is not clear that\nwhen making his decision to resolve the mater though a state-based plea, he knew the extent to\n\nl83\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3385", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003386.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2lo of 348\nwhich Villafafia and Lourie believed that the state had intentionally failed to aggressively pursue\na broader state indictment.\n\nOne example illustrates this communication gap. In a September 2o, 2oo7 email to Lourie\nasking him to read the latest version of the proposed “hybrid” federal plea agreement (calling for\nEpstein to plead to both state and federal charges), Acosta noted, “I don’t typically sign plea\nagreements. We should only go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement. I\ndidn’t even sign the public corruption or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not be the first.”\n(Emphasis added.) In his email to Villafafia, Lourie atached Acosta’s email and instructed\nVillafafia to “change the signature block to your name and send as final to Jay [Lefkouitz].”\n(Emphasis added.) Villafafia raised no objection to signing the agreement. Acosta told OPR that\nhe wanted to give the “trial team” a chance to “speak up and let him knou” if they did not feel\ncomfortable with the agreement. Villafafia, houever, told OPR that she did not understand that\nshe was being given an opportunity to object to the agreement; rather, she believed Acosta wanted\nher to sign it because he was taking an ‘“‘arm’s length” approach and signaling this “was not his\ndeal.” The fact that the top decision maker believed he was giving the line AUSA an opportunity\nto reflect and stop the process if she believed the deal was inappropriate, but the line AUSA\nbelieved she was being ordered to sign the agreement because her boss wanted to distance himself\nfrom the decision, reflects a serious communication gap.\n\nAs another example, at one point, Villafafia, frustrated and concerned about the decisions\nbeing made concerning a possible <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, requested a meeting with Acosta; in a sternly worded\nrebuke, Menchel rejected the request. Although Menchel told OPR that he was not prohibiting\nVillafafia from speaking to Acosta, Villafafia interpreted Menchel’s email to mean that she could\nnot seek a meeting with Acosta. As a consequence, Acosta made his decision about a state\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> and the term of incarceration without any direct input from Villafafia. Acosta told OPR\nthat he was unaware that Villafafia had sought a meeting with him and he would have met with\nher if she had asked him directly. OPR did not find any writen evidence of a meeting involving\nboth Acosta—the final decision maker—and Villafafia—the person most knouledgeable about the\nfacts and the law—before Acosta made his decision to resolve the case through state charges or to\noffer the two-year term, and Villafafia said she did not have any input into the decision. Although\na U.S. Atorney is certainly not required to have such direct input, and it may be that Menchel\npresented what he believed to be Villafafia’s views, OPR found no evidence that Acosta was aware\nof Villafafia’s strong views about, and objections to, the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>.*°°\n\nTwo logistical problems hindered effective communication. First, the senior managers\ninvolved in the case—Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel—had offices located in Miami, while the\noffices of the individuals most familiar with facts of the case—Villafafia and, to a lesser extent,\nLourie—were located in West Palm Beach. Consequently, Villafafia’s discussions with her senior\n256 In her 2ol7 Declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that, given the challenges of obtaining\nvictims’ cooperation with a federal prosecution, “I believed and still believe that a negotiated <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the mater\nwas in the best interests of the [USAO] and the victims as a whole. The [USAO] had also reached that same\nconclusion.” Several subjects pointed to this statement as indicating that Villafafia in fact supported the NPA. In her\nOPR interview, houever, Villafafia drew a distinction between resolving the investigation through negotiations that\nled to what in her view was a reasonable outcome, which she would have supported, and “this negotiated <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>”—\nthat is, the NPA—which she did not support.\n\nl84\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3386", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003387.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ll of 348\nmanagers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.”*’\n\nSecond, key personnel were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the... bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third\nad In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3387", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003388.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l2 of 348\nparties.7°° The rush to reach a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> should not have led the USAO to agree to such a\nsignificant provision without a full consideration of the potential consequences and justification\nfor the provision. It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n2n8 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s\n\nunderstood that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you\n\nknou the husband’s willing to go and take the weight .... This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3388", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003389.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l3 of 348\nfrom Villafafia and others, but given the highly unusual procedure being considered, his decision\nshould have been made only after a full consideration of all of the possible ramifications and\nconsequences of pushing the mater into the state court system, with which neither Villafafia nor\nthe other subjects had experience, along with consideration of the legal and evidentiary issues and\npossible means of overcoming those issues. OPR did not find evidence indicating that such a\nmeeting or discussion with the full team was held before the decision was made to pursue the\nstate-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term of incarceration, or\nbefore the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed. As Acosta later recognized and told OPR,\n“And a question that I think is a valid one in my mind is, did the focus on, let’s just get this done\nand get a jail term, mean that we didn’t take a step back and say, let’s evaluate hou this train is\nmoving?”\n\nMany features of the NPA were given inadequate consideration, including core provisions\nlike the term of incarceration and sexual offender registration, with the result that Epstein was able\nto manipulate the process to his benefit. Members of his senior staff held differing opinions about\nsome of the issues that Acosta felt were important and that factored into his decision-making.\nThere does not seem to be a point, houever, at which those differing opinions were considered\nwhen forming a strategy; rather, Acosta seems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him\nfolloued and atempted to implement but without a considered strategy beyond ataining the three\ncore elements. As the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had authority to proceed in this manner, but many of\nthe problems that developed with the NPA might have been avoided with a more thoughtful\napproach. As Acosta belatedly recognized, “[I]f I was advising a fellou U.S. Atorney today, I\nwould say, think it through.”\n\nNo one of the individual problems discussed above necessarily demonstrates poor\njudgment by itself. Houever, in combination, the evidence shous that the state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>\nwas ill conceived from the start and that the NPA resulted from a flawed decision-making process.\nFrom the time the USAO opened its investigation, Acosta recognized the federal interest in\nprosecuting Epstein, yet after that investigation had run for more than a year, he set the\ninvestigation on a path not originally contemplated. Having done so, he had responsibility for\nensuring that he received and considered all of the necessary information before puting an end to\na federal investigation into serious criminal conduct. Acosta’s failure to adequately consider the\nfull ramifications of the NPA contributed to a process and ultimately a result that left not only the\nline AUSA and the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also caused victims and the public to question\nthe motives of the prosecutors and whether any reasonable measure of justice was achieved.\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he chose a course of\naction that was in marked contrast to the action that the Department would reasonably expect an\natorney exercising good judgment to take.\n\n259 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney acknouledged that “[t]he mater would have\nbenefited from more consistent staffing and atention.”\nl87\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3389", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003392.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l6 of 348\n. . . 7D: oe\nTimeline of Key Events for Crime Victims’ Rights Act Analysis\nAug lo — FBI Dec 7 — Sloman tells Iuly 7 —Jane Doe files an Additional Key Dates\nbegins interviewing Villafafia to “hold the emergency petition against\nvictims leter” re notification fo the United States asserting Dec l7. 2olo DOJ\nvictims about state court violations of the CVRA mi\nnee Office of Legal\nplea hearing Mar l9 — Villafafia Counsel issues opinion\n; ug sie re : = - secures pro-bono July 9— USAO begins regarding CVRA\na oe , ee ee Dec l9 — Acosta sends atorneys for victims sending leters to victims\nF on i eg - oo ae i leter to Epstein’s counsel Mar-Mavy — FBI concerning <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of Oct 2oll — DOJ revises\nsaid satan nee ad Ea advising USAO will defer Rise AM federal investigation AG Guidelines\nof the girls MEO One ee : interviews victims\nnotification of state plea\nto state officials May 29, 2ol5-CVRA\nAug 28 — FBI begins _ amended to include two\nsending VNS leters it\nee ses Jan lo— FBI new rights\n— ds VNS let :\nee ae Feb 2l, 2ol9 — Dist.

The Case Agents and Villafafia Solicit Some Victims’ Opinions about\n\nResolving the Federal Investigation\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when she and the case agents met with victims, “we would ask\nthem hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” 7*!\n\nAnd most of them wanted the case to be resolved via a plea. Some\nof them wanted him not to be prosecuted at all. Most of them did\nnot want to have to come to court and testify. They were very\nworried about their privacy rights. Some of them wanted him to go\nto jail. But... [s]ome of them talked about bad experiences with\nthe State Atorney’s Office. And so, I felt like sending them back to\nthe State Atorney’s Office was not something that they would have\nsupported.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she also recalled that some victims “expressed . . . concern about\ntheir safety,” and were worried that Epstein would find out about their participation in the\ninvestigation. In her 2ol7 declaration submited in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that the\ntwo CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my\nrole was to evaluate the entire situation, consider the input received from all of the victims, and\nallou the Office to exercise its prosecutorial discretion accordingly.”*? She also noted that some\nvictims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would\nhave on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”\n\nIn the FBI case agent’s 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During\ninterviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be\nprosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s]\n\nvictims .... A majority of the victims expressed concern about the\n\npossible disclosure of their identities to the public. A number of the\n\nvictims raised concerns about having to testify and/or their parents\n\nfinding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein. Additionally,\n26 Villafafia created for OPR a chart listing victims identified in the state and federal investigations, with\nnotations indicating several with whom Villafafia recalled discussing their opinions about resolving the case. The\nchart, houever, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafafia told OPR that the information contained in the\nchart was based on her memory of her interactions with each victim. OPR was unable to determine the details or\nextent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2oo7, because Villafafia did not have contemporaneous\nnotes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information\nabout the victims’ desired outcomes. The victims who provided information to OPR did not recall discussing potential\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal investigation with anyone from the government.\n282 In the declaration, Villafafia stated, “Jane Doe 2 specifically told me that she did not want Epstein\nprosecuted.”\n\n2ol\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003404.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 228 of 348\nfor some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall,\nmany of the victims were troubled about the existence of the\ninvestigation. They displayed feelings of embarrassment and\nhumiliation and were reluctant to talk to investigators. Some\nvictims who were identified through the investigation refused even\nto speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and\ngeting to the truth were always at the forefront of our handling of\nthe investigation.\nThe case agent told OPR that although she encountered victims who were “strong” and\n“believable,” she did not encounter any who vigorously advocated for the prosecution of Epstein.\nRather, “they were embarrassed,” “didn’t want their parents to knou,” and “wanted to forget.””*\nAs of September 24, 2oo7, the date the NPA was signed, Villafafia informed Epstein\natorney Lefkouitz that she had compiled a preliminary list of victims including “34 confirmed\nminors” and 6 other potential minor victims who had not yet been interviewed by the FBI.7*4\nAlthough the government had contacted many victims before the NPA was signed, Villafafia\nacknouledged during the CVRA litigation that “individual victims were not consulted regarding\nthe agreement.”\nB. Before the NPA Is Signed, Villafafia Expresses Concern That Victims Have\nNot Been Consulted\nBefore the NPA was signed, Villafafia articulated to her supervisors concerns about the\ngovernment’s failure to consult with victims.\nl. July 2oo7: Villafafia’s Email Exchanges with Menchel\nIn July 2oo7, Villafafia learned that Menchel had discussed with defense counsel Sanchez\na possible state <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> to the federal investigation of Epstein. Villafafia was upset by this\ninformation, and sent a strongly worded email to Menchel voicing her concerns. (A full account\nof their email exchange is set forth at Chapter Two, Part One, Section IV.A.2.) In that email, she\ntold him that it was “inappropriate [for you] to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE, the victims, and me. These plea negotiations violate . . . all of the\n283 The case agent also noted that the victim who became CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 had expressed in her\nApril 2oo7 video-recorded FBI interview her opinion that “nothing should happen to Epstein.”\n284 The “victims’ list” for purposes of the NPA was intended to include the names of all individuals whom the\ngovernment was prepared to name in a charging document “as victims of an offense enumerated in l8 U.S.C. § 2255.”\nAlthough the charges Villafafia proposed on May l, 2oo7, were based on crimes against l3 victims, thereafter, as\nexplained in Chapter Two of this Report, she continued to revise the proposed charges, adding and removing victims\nas the federal investigation developed further evidence. At the time the NPA was signed, the proposed charges were\nbased on crimes against l9 victims, but others had been identified for potential inclusion.\n2o2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003405.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 229 of 348\nvarious iterations of the victims’ rights legislation.”** Villafafia explained to OPR her reference\nto the victims:\n\n[M]y concern was that [Menchel] was violating the CVRA which\n\nrequires the atorneys for the government, which[] includes me[,] to\n\nconfer with the victims, and the [VRRA], which requires the agents\n\nto keep the victims apprised of what’s happening with the case. So\n\nin essence, I felt like he was exposing both myself and the agents to\n\nallegations of not abiding by our obligations by engaging in these\n\nplea negotiations without leting us knou about it.7®°\n\nIn his reply to Villafafia’s email, and after noting that he found her email “totally\ninappropriate,” Menchel denied that he had violated any Departmental policy, and he noted that\n“Ta]s Chief of the Criminal Division, I am the person designated by the U.S. Atorney to exercise\nappropriate discretion in deciding whether certain pleas are appropriate and consistent with”\nDepartmental policy. Perceiving Menchel’s rebuke as a criticism of her judgment, Villafafia\nresponded, “[R]aising concerns about the forgoten voices of victims in this case should not be\nclassified as a lapse in judgment” and that her “first and only concern in this case. . . is the victims.”\nMenchel told OPR that he did not view his conversation with Sanchez as a plea offer,\nasserted that he was not obligated to consult with victims during preliminary setlement\nnegotiations, and noted that he left the USAO before the NPA was fully negotiated or signed.\nMenchel told OPR that “you have discussions . . . with [the] defense all the time, and the notion\nthat even just having a general discussion is something that must be veted with victims . . . is not\neven... in the same universe as to hou I think about this.” Menchel also observed that on the\nvery day that Villafafia criticized him for engaging in setlement negotiations without consulting\nher, the FBI, or the victims, Villafafia had herself sent an email to Sanchez offering “to discuss the\npossibility of a federal <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of Mr. Epstein’s case that could run concurrently with any state\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>,” without having spoken to the victims about her proposal.7*”\n288 Villafafia told OPR that “some victims, I felt strongly, would have objected to [a state-only disposition].”\nVillafafia stated to OPR that at the time Menchel engaged in such negotiations, he would only have been aware of the\nvictim information contained in her prosecution memorandum, which included information about the “effects on the\nvictims” but did not likely contain information as to “hou they would like the case resolved.” Villafafia asserted that\nMenchel “never reached out to any of the victims to find out what their position would be.” Menchel told OPR that\nthe allegations in Villafafia’s email that he violated the Ashcroft Memo, USAM, and the CVRA were “way out of line\nin terms of what the law is and the policies are.”\n286 As discussed, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not apply before charges were\nfiled against a defendant.\n287 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel asserted that her email to Sanchez was intended\nonly to determine whether Epstein was interested in opening plea negotiations.\n2o3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003407.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23l of 348\nChief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.”?! Sloman forwarded this\nemail to Acosta. Villafafia recalled that Sloman responded to her email by telephone, possibly\nafter he had spoken to Acosta, and stated, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.” Villafafia did not recall\nSloman explaining at the time the reason for that instruction.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[WJe’ve\nbeen advised that . . . pre-charge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Sloman did not\nrecall any discussions, before the NPA was signed, about contacting the victims or conferring with\nthem regarding the potential <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the case. Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that\nwe had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek\napproval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the notification issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.”” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”?”°\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.””* Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate\n22) Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “he was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\n\n282 Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\ni The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n2o4 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto .. . instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003408.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 232 of 348\ndisagreement” regarding the CVRA’s requirements.””> Oosterban’s disagreement was based on\npolicy considerations, and he told OPR that “from a policy perspective,” CEOS would not “take a\nposition that you wouldn’t consult with [the victims].” Oosterban also told OPR that whether or\nnot the law required it, the victims should have been given an opportunity “to weigh in directly,”\nbut he did not fault the USAO’s motivations for failing to provide that opportunity:\n\nThe people I knou, Andy [Lourie], Jeff [Sloman], . . . were trying\nto do the right thing. . . . [T]hey weren’t acting unethically. I just\ndisagree with the outcome .. . but the point is they weren’t trying\n... to do anything improper . . . it was more of this question of . . .\nyou can let the victims weigh in on this, you can get their input on\nthis and maybe it doesn’t sway you. You still do what you’re going\nto do but .. . it’s hard to say it was a complete, completely clean\nexercise of . . . prosecutorial discretion when [the USAO] didn’t\nreally knou what [the victims] would say.\n\nSloman told OPR, “I don’t think we had a concern about entering into the NPA at that point\nin terms of notifying victims. . . . | was under the perception that once the NPA was entered into\nand [Epstein] was going to enter a guilty plea in state court that we were going to notify the\nvictims.”\n\nVU. SEPTEMBER 24, 2oo7 — JUNE 3o, 2oo8: AFTER THE NPA IS SIGNED, THE\n\nUSAO MAKES VARIOUS VICTIM NOTIFICATION DECISIONS\n\nThe contemporaneous emails make clear that once the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the\ncase agents planned to inform the victims about the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal investigation.\nHouever, the emails also shou that the USAO was unclear about hou much information could be\ngiven to the victims in light of the NPA’s nondisclosure provision and consulted with Epstein’s\ndefense counsel regarding victim notifications.?”° As a result, although the expectation in the\nUSAO was that the victims would be informed about the NPA, the monetary damages provision,\nand the state plea, the USAO became entangled in more negotiations with the defense atorneys,\nwho strongly objected to the government’s notification plan. In addition, Villafafia and the case\nagents grew concerned that notifying the victims about the NPA monetary damages provision\nwould damage the victims’ credibility if Epstein breached the NPA and the case went to trial. In\nthe end, Acosta decided to defer to the State Atorney’s discretion whether to notify the victims\nabout the state plea, and information about the NPA and the monetary damages provision was not\nprovided to victims until after Epstein pled guilty in June 2oo8.\na Oosterban stated that, in retrospect, “maybe I should have been more aggressive with hou . . . I dealt with\n[the USAO].”\n\n296 The NPA nondisclosure provision stated: “The parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part\nof any public record. If the United States receives a Freedom of Information Act request or any compulsory process\ncommanding the disclosure of the agreement, it will provide notice to Epstein before making that disclosure.”\n2o6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo34o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003409.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 233 of 348\nA.

Acosta responded that he would set up a\ncall on September 26, 2oo7, to talk “about who we can tell and hou much.”*°°\n\nAlso on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed the new West Palm Beach manager to\ninform him that once the atorney representative was appointed for the victims, she planned to\n“meet with the girls myself to explain hou the system [for obtaining relief under l8 U.S.C. § 2255]\nwill work.” Villafafia also emailed Lefkouitz stating that she planned to discuss with him “what\nI can tell [the atorney representative] and the girls about the agreement,” and she assured\nLefkouitz that her office “is telling Chief Reiter not to disclose the outcome to anyone.” Villafafia\nalso provided Lefkouitz with a list of potential candidates for the atorney representative position\nand advocated for an atorney representative who would minimize press coverage of the mater.\n\nOn September 26, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Lefkouitz to request guidance on informing the\nvictims about the NPA: “Can you give me a call... I am meeting with the agents and want to\ngive them their marching orders regarding what they can tell the girls.” Villafafia told OPR that\nbecause the government and the defense had not agreed on the atorney representative for the\nvictims, she reached out to the defense at the direction of either Acosta or Sloman in order to\ncoordinate hou to inform the victims about the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the case and the fact that there would\nbe an atorney to assist them in recovering monetary damages from Epstein. Villafafia told OPR\nthat the defense responded to her email by complaining to her supervisors that she should not be\noad Villafafia had assured Lefkouitz that the NPA “would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would\nremain part of our case file. It probably would be subject to a FOIA request, but it is not something that we would\ndistribute without compulsory process.”\n228 Acosta told OPR that he believed that the NPA “would see the light of day” because the victims would have\nto “hear about [their § 2255 rights] from somewhere” and “given the press interest, eventually this would be FOTA’d.”\nad Lourie told OPR that the § 2255 provisions of the NPA “that benefited the victims were there for the victims\nto take advantage of... . and they did. Hou. . . they were going to receive that information and when they were going\nto receive it is a different question, but there’s no . . . issue with the fact that they were going to get that information.”\n3oo OPR was unable to determine whether the call took place.\n\n2o7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003410.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 234 of 348\ninvolved in such notifications. According to Villafafia, Sloman then directed her to have the case\nagents make the victim notifications.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia directed the case agents to “meet with the victims to provide them\nwith information regarding the terms of the [NPA] and the conclusion of the federal investigation.”\nThe case agent told OPR, “[T]here was a discussion that Marie and I had as\nto... hou we would tell them, and what we would tell them, and what that was I don’t recall, but\nit was the terms of the agreement.” Villafafia believed that if “victims were properly notified of\nthe terms [of the NPA] that applied to them, regarding their right to seek damages from [Epstein],\nand he paid those damages, that the rest of the [NPA] doesn’t need to be disclosed.” Villafafia\n“anticipated that [the case agents] would be able to inform the victims of the date of the state court\nchange of plea [hearing], but that date had not yet been set by state authorities at the time the first\nvictims were notified [by the FBI].” Villafafia told OPR that it was her belief that because the\nUSAO had agreed to a confidentiality clause, the government could not disclose the NPA to the\ngeneral public, but victims could be informed “because by its terms they needed to be told what\nthe agreement was about.” Villafafia told OPR that no one in her supervisory chain expressed a\nconcern that if victims learned of the NPA, they would try to prevent Epstein from entering a plea.\n\nWithin a week after the NPA was signed, news media began reporting that the parties had\nreached a deal to resolve the Epstein case. For example, on October l, 2oo7, the\nNew York Post reported that Epstein “has agreed to plead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes\nat his Florida mansion in a deal that will send him to prison for about l8 months,” and noted that\nEpstein would plead guilty in state court and that “the feds have agreed to drop their probe into\npossible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge.”*°!\n\nThe case agent recalled informing some victims that “there was an agreement reached” and\n“we would not be pursuing this federally.” In October 2oo7, for example, the case agents met with\nvictim Courtney Wild, “to advise her of the main terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement.”\nAccording to the case agent, during that meeting, the case agents told Wild “that an agreement had\nbeen reached, Mr. Epstein was going to plead guilty to two state charges, and there would not be\na federal prosecution.”*° Houever, in a declaration filed in 2ol5 in the CVRA litigation, Wild\ndescribed the conversation differently:\n\n[T]he agents explained that Epstein was also being charged in State\n\ncourt and may plea [sic] to state charges related to some of his other\n\nvictims. I knew that State charges had nothing to do with me.\nao Dan Mangan, ““Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For Teen Sex Massages,” New York\nPost, Oct. l, 2oo7.

Villafafia recalled that during a brief telephone consultation, the Professional\nResponsibility Officer advised her and the case agent that “it’s not really that big a concern, but if\nyou’re concerned about it then you should stop making the notification.”° In her 2ol7 CVRA\ndeclaration, the case agent stated that after conferring with the USAO, the case agents stopped\nnotifying victims about the NPA.\n\nB. October 2oo7: Defense Atorneys Object to Government Victim Notifications\n\nWhile the case agents and Villafafia considered the impact that notifying the victims about\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the case might have on a potential trial, defense counsel also raised concerns\nabout what the victims could be told about the NPA. As discussed in Chapter Two, after the NPA\nwas signed on September 24, 2oo7, the USAO proposed using a special master to select the\natorney representative for the victims, which led to further discussions about the § 2255 provision.\nOn October 5, 2oo7, when defense atorney Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a leter responding to the\nUSAO’s proposal to use a special master, he cautioned that “neither federal agents nor anyone\nfrom your Office should contact the identified individuals to inform them of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the\ncase” because such communications would “violate the confidentiality of the agreement” and\nwould prevent Epstein from having control over “what is communicated to the identified\nindividuals at this most critical stage.” Lefkouitz folloued this communication with an October\nlo, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, arguing that “[n]either federal agents nor anyone from your Office should\ncontact the identified individuals to inform them of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the case.”*°° Rather,\nLefkouitz wanted to “participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication to the identified\nindividuals.”\n\nOn October 23, 2oo7, Villafafia raised the issue of victim notification with Sloman, stating:\n\nWealso have to contact the victims to tell [them] about the outcome\nof the case and to advise them that an atorney will be contacting\nthem regarding possible claims against Mr. Epstein. If we don’t do\nthat, it may be a violation of the Florida Bar Rules for the selected\natorney to ‘cold call’ the girls.\n\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter Two, on October 23, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent Acosta\na leter stating that Epstein expected to enter a guilty plea in state court on November 2o, 2oo7,\nao The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR that he did not recall the case agent contacting him about\nvictim notification, nor did he recall being involved in the Epstein mater before the CVRA litigation was instituted\nin July 2oo8 and he was assigned to handle the litigation. Villafafia told OPR that they consulted the Professional\nResponsibility Officer over the telephone, the call took no more than “five minutes,” and the Professional\nResponsibility Officer had no other exposure to the case and thus “wouldn’t have [any] context for it.”\n\n3o6 Lefkouitz also argued that direct contact with the victims could violate grand jury secrecy rules.\n2lo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003413.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 237 of 348\nand thanking Acosta for agreeing on October l2, 2oo7, not to “contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this\nmater.”°°7 Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Acosta\nrevised to clarify the “inaccurate” representations made by Lefkouitz, in particular noting that\nAcosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact. The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\n\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\ncommunications that are typical in these maters. As an example,\nour Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them\nthat either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing]\nthem. Rest assured that we will continue to treat this mater as we\nwould any similarly situated case.°°\nIn a November 5, 2oo7 leter, Sloman complained to Lefkouitz that private investigators\nworking for Epstein had been contacting victims and asking whether government agents had\ndiscussed financial setlement with them. Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some circumstances.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?””>”\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to Investigate,\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been identified in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o2 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\nao8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n3o9 Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to\ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003414.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 238 of 348\nNPA.*!° The FBI reports of the victim interviews do not mention the NPA or indicate that the\nvictims were asked for their input regarding the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the case. Villafafia acknouledged\nthat she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the\nagreement because “at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and\nthat we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”\n\nOn October l2, 2oo7, the FBI Victim Specialist sent a VNS form notice leter to a victim\nthe case agents had interviewed two days earlier. This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim Specialist sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\nidentified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD. The USAO Informs the Defense That It Intends to Notify Victims by Leter\nabout Epstein’s State Plea Hearing and the <span class=\"highlight\">Resolution</span> of the Federal\nInvestigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the Notification Plan\n\nIn anticipation of Epstein’s state court plea, Villafafia reported on November l6, 2oo7, to\nAcosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that she had learned, from FBI agents who met with\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek, that the State Atorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify\nvictims of the state plea hearing.\n\n[Belohlavek] would still like us to do the victim notifications. The\n\nState does not have a procedure (like we do federally) where the\n\nCourt has to provide a separate room for victims who want to atend\n\njudicial proceedings, so I do not knou hou many victims will\n\nactually want to be present.>!!\nBelohlavek told OPR that she did not recall the conversation referenced by the FBI nor any\ncoordination between her office and federal officials to contact or notify victims about Epstein’s\nstate plea hearing.\n\nOn November l9, 2oo7, Villafafia decided that to avoid any misconduct accusations from\nthe defense about the information given to victims, she “would put the victim notification in\nwriting.” She provided Sloman with a draft victim notification leter, in which among other things,\n3l9 Not all the individuals interviewed qualified for inclusion on the victim list. For example, one would not\ncooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third\nclaimed she had no contact with Epstein.\n\n3ll Villafafia told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or\ntwo victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”\n2l2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003415.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 239 of 348\nshe would inform victims of the terms of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal case, including Epstein’s\nagreement to plead guilty to state charges and serve l8 months in county jail, and the victims’\nability to seek monetary damages against Epstein. The leter also would invite victims to appear\nat the state court hearing and make a statement under oath or provide a writen statement to be\nfiled by the State Atorney’s Office. Sloman and Villafafia exchanged edits on the draft victim\nnotification leter, and Villafafia also informed Sloman that “[t]here are a few girls who didn’t\nreceive the original leters, so I will need to modify the introductory portion of the leter for\nthose.”?”\n\nSloman informed Lefkouitz of the government’s need to meet its “statutory obligation\n(Justice for All Act of 2oo4) to notify the victims of the anticipated upcoming events and their\nrights associated with the agreement” and his intent to “notify the victims by leter after COB\nThursday, November 29.” Lefkouitz objected to the proposal to notify the victims, asserting that\nit was “incendiary and inappropriate” and not warranted under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4. He\nargued that the defense “should have a right to review and make objections to that submission\nprior to it being sent to any alleged victims.” He also insisted that if any notification leters were\nsent to “victims, who still have not been identified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein\nhas entered his plea” and that the leter should come from the atorney representative rather than\nthe government. On November 28, 2oo7, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia provided Lefkouitz\nwith the draft victim notification leter, which would advise victims that the state court plea was\nto occur on December l4, 2oo7.7\"\n\nIn a November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz strongly objected to the proposed draft\nnotification leter, arguing that the government was not obligated to send any leter to victims until\nafter Epstein’s plea and sentencing. Lefkouitz also contended that the victims had no right to\nappear at Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing or to provide a writen statement for such a\nproceeding. In a November 3o, 2oo7 reply leter to Lefkouitz, Acosta did not address the\nsubstance of Lefkouitz’s arguments, but accused the defense team of “in essence presenting\ncollateral challenges” delaying effectuation of the NPA, and asserted that if Epstein was\ndissatisfied with the NPA, “we stand ready to unwind the Agreement” and proceed to trial. Shortly\nthereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by leter that he had directed prosecutors “not to\nissue victim notification leters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time\nto review these options with your client.” In the leter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that\nVillafafia had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary\ndamages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during\nthe investigation phase of this mater.”\n\nOn December 5, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz sent a leter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman\nand Assistant Atorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with\n3l2 On November 28, 2oo7, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafafia that\nonly l5 of the then-knoun victims had received victim notification leters from either the FBI or the USAO. On\nDecember 6, 2oo7, the lead case agent reported to Villafafia that she was “still holding many of the original V/W\nleters addressed to victims from the USAO.”\n\nSis Villafafia understood the state prosecutors had set the December l4, 2oo7 date, and emailed them for\nconfirmation, stating, “[I]f the mater is set for the l4th, please let me knou so I can include that in my victim\nnotifications.”\n2l3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003416.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 24o of 348\nthe USAO’s interpretation of the agreement and “the use of Section 2255.” The Starr and\nLefkouitz leter asserted it was “wholly inappropriate” for the USAO to send the proposed victim\nnotification leter “under any circumstances,” and “strongly urg[ed]” Acosta to withhold the\nnotification leter until after the defense was able “to discuss this mater with Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Fisher.”\n\nThe follouing day, Sloman sent a leter to Lefkouitz, with copies to Acosta and Villafafia,\nasserting that the VRRA obligated the government to notify victims of the l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nproceedings as “other relief’ to which they were entitled. Sloman also stated that the VRRA\nobligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning restitution to which\nthey may be entitled and “the earliest possible’ notice of the status of the investigation, the filing\nof charges, and the acceptance of a plea.*'* (Emphasis in original). Sloman added:\n\nJust as in l8 U.S.C. § 377l [the CVRA], these sections are not\n\nlimited to proceedings in a federal district court. Our Non-\n\nProsecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by\n\nallouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense. The victims\n\nidentified through the federal investigation should be appropriately\n\ninformed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.**°\nSloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafafia or the\nFBI case agent with questions or concerns: “Again, federal law requires that victims have the\n‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’” Sloman advised\nthe defense: “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed\nto Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation. Those questions are appropriately directed to\nlaw enforcement.”\n\nAlong with this leter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkouitz for comment a revised draft victim\nnotification leter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense. The\nleter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been completed,” Epstein would\nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of imprisonment at sentencing,\nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The\nleter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing:\n\nAs I mentioned above, as part of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal\n\ninvestigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.\n\nMr. Epstein’s change of plea and sentencing will occur on\n\nDecember l4, 2oo7, at ___—a.m., before Judge Sandra K. McSorley,\n3l4 See 42 U.S.C. § lo6o7(c)(l)(B) and (c)(3).\n3l5 Emphasis in original. Sloman also stated that the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is\nsimply informing the victims of their rights.” Villafafia informed OPR that Sloman approved and signed the leter,\nbut she was the primary author of the document. OPR notes that Villafafia was the principal author of most\ncorrespondence in the Epstein case, and that follouing the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the leter went\nout with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three atorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence\nbefore a final version was sent to the defense.\n\n2l4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003418.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 242 of 348\nher a victim for purposes of the federal charges, and continued to treat her as a victim because she\nwanted “to go above and beyond in terms of caring for the victims.”?\"®\n\nE. December l9, 2oo7: Acosta Advises the Defense That the USAO Will Defer to\n\nthe State Atorney the Decision Whether to Notify Victims of the State Plea\nHearing, but the USAO Would Notify Them of the Federal <span class=\"highlight\">Resolution</span>, “as\nRequired by Law”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo7, Starr transmited to Acosta two lengthy submissions authored by\nLefkouitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to “the background and conduct of\nthe investigation” into Epstein. Regarding issues relevant to victim notification, in his transmital\nleter, Starr asserted that the “latest episodes involving [§] 2255 notification to the alleged victims\nput illustratively in bold relief our concerns that the ends of justice, time and time again, are not\nbeing served.” By way of example, Starr complained the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it\nwas clear from the girl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a\nvictim.”\n\nIn his submissions, Lefkouitz argued that the government was not required to notify\nvictims of the § 2255 provision:\n\nVillafafia’s decision to utilize a civil remedy statute in the place of\na restitution fund for the alleged victims eliminates the notification\nrequirement under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4, a federal law that\nrequires federal authorities to notify victims as to any available\nrestitution, not of any potential civil remedies. Despite this fact,\n[she] proposed a Victims Notification leter to be sent to the alleged\nfederal victims.\n\nLefkouitz also argued that a victim trust fund would provide a more appropriate\nmechanism for compensating the victims than the government’s proposed use of l8 U.S.C. § 2255,\nand a trust fund would not violate Epstein’s due process rights. Lefkouitz took issue with the\ngovernment’s “assertion” that the USAO was obligated to send a victim notification leter to the\nalleged victims, or even that it was appropriate for the USAO to do so. Lefkouitz further argued\nthat the government misinterpreted both the CVRA and the VRRA, because neither applied to a\npublic, state court proceeding involving the entry of a plea on state charges.\n\nIn a leter from Villafafia to Lefkouitz, responding to his allegations that she had\ncommited misconduct, she specifically addressed the “false” allegations that the government had\n3l8 As noted previously, in April 2oo7, this victim gave a video-recorded interview to the FBI that was favorable\nto Epstein. Villafafia told OPR she was instructed by ether Sloman or Acosta “not to consider [this individual] as a\nvictim for purposes of the NPA because she was not someone whom the Office was prepare[d] to include in” a federal\ncharging document. Accordingly, the victim who became “Jane Doe #2” was not included on the victim list ultimately\nfurnished to the defense.

In a later filing in the CVRA litigation,\nhouever, Edwards asserted that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading guilty to state\nsolicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edwards’ clients nor any of\nthe federally-identified victims.”*°° Edwards further claimed that because Villafafia failed to\ninform him that the “guilty pleas in state court would bring an end to the possibility of federal\nprosecution pursuant to the plea agreement,” his clients did not atend the hearing.

July 7, 2oo8: The CVRA Litigation Is Initiated\n\nOn July 3, 2oo8, victims’ atorney Edwards spoke to Villafafia by telephone about the\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the state case against Epstein “and the next stage of the federal prosecution.”*°’ In\nhis 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, Edwards asserted that during this conversation,\nVillafafia did not inform him of the NPA, but that during the call, he sensed that the USAO “was\nbeginning to negotiate with Epstein concerning the federally identified crimes.” Houever, in an\nemail Villafafia sent after the call, she informed Sloman that during the call, Edwards stated that\n“his clients can name many more victims and wanted to knou if we can get out of the deal.”\nVillafafia told Sloman that after she told Edwards that the government was bound by the\nagreement, assuming Epstein completed it, Edwards asked that “if there is the slightest bit of\nhesitation on Epstein’s part of completing his performance, that he and his [three] clients be\nalloued to consult with [the USAO] before making a decision.”*°°\n\nThat same day, Edwards wrote a leter to Villafafia, complaining that Epstein’s state court\nsentence was “grossly inadequate for a predator of this magnitude” and urged Villafafia to “move\nforward with the traditional indictments and criminal prosecution commensurate with the crimes\nMr. Epstein has commited.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, Edwards filed his emergency petition in the U.S. District Court for the\nSouthern District of Florida on behalf of Courtney Wild, who was then identified only as “Jane\nDoe.” She was soon joined by a second petitioner, and they were respectively referred to as “Jane\nDoe l” and “Jane Doe 2.”3°? Edwards claimed that the government had violated his clients’ rights\nunder the CVRA by negotiating to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein without consulting\nwith the victims.

I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [victim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key conclusion that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> after development of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\nintention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\nconcluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[iJt was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”>*°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, “[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 Guidelines for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]uidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3445", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003459.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 283 of 348\nand consider victims’ views about, prospective plea negotiations.*”* The “prosecution stage”\nbegan when charges were filed and continued through all post-sentencing legal proceedings.*””\n\nAt the time the parties signed the NPA in September 2oo7, few courts had addressed victim\nstanding under the CVRA.

Menchel told OPR he believed the USAO was not required to\nconsult with victims during the preliminary “general discussion” phase of setlement negotiations;\nmoreover, he left the USAO before the terms of the NPA were fully developed.\n\nSloman told OPR that he “did not think that we had to consult with victims prior to entering\ninto the NPA” and “we did not have to seek approval from victims to resolve a case.” Sloman\nbelieved the USAO was obligated only to notify victims about <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of “the cases that we\nhandled, filed cases.” Sloman recalled that because the USAO envisioned a state court <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>\nof the mater, he did not “think that that was a concern of ours at the time to consult with [the\nvictims] prior to entering into... the NPA.”\n\nLourie told OPR that he did not recall any discussions about informing the victims about\nthe terms of the NPA or any instructions to Villafafia that she not discuss the NPA with the victims.\nHe stated that everything the USAO did was “to try and get the best result as possible for the\nvictims. . . .

In addition, Villafafia’s reference to victim “approval” was inaccurate\nbecause the CVRA, even when applicable, requires only “consultation” with victims about prosecutorial decisions.\n‘o5 Villafaia did not recall Sloman explaining the reason for the decision.\n\n4o6 Villafafia also told OPR that she recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations\ncould cause victims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.” Villafafia was\nuncertain of the date of the conversation, but Menchel’s presence requires it to have occurred before August 3, 2oo7.\n259\nDOJ-OGR- oooo346l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003463.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 287 of 348\nrequire victim approval of the prosecutors’ plans, but it allous victims the opportunity to express\ntheir views and to be heard before a final decision is made.

LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\n\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.” 4\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim Specialist. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\n4o8 Villafafia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\nGuidelines, Art. IV, § B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners.

ACOSTA’S DECISION TO DEFER TO THE STATE ATTORNEY’S\n\nDISCRETION WHETHER TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT EPSTEIN’S STATE\n\nCOURT PLEA HEARING DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR OR UNAMBIGUOUS\n\nSTANDARD; HOWEVER, ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY\n\nFAILING TO ENSURE THAT VICTIMS IDENTIFIED IN THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION WERE ADVISED OF THE STATE PLEA HEARING\n\nAs set forth in the factual discussion, within a few weeks of the NPA’s signing, it became\nclear that the defense team disagreed with, and strongly objected to, the government’s plan to\ninform victims of their ability to recover monetary damages from Epstein, under the l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 provision of the NPA, and about Epstein’s state court plea hearing. The USAO initially\ntook the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA,\nincluding the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that\nvictims who wanted to atend could do so.\n\nIn November and December 2oo7, Epstein’s atorneys challenged the USAO’s position\nregarding victim notification. Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim\nnotifications. Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected\nto defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing\npursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights requirements. Acosta also determined that the USAO\nwould notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255,\na decision that was implemented by leters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.\nThis decision, which postponed notification of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas,\nwas based, at least in part, on Villafafia’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to\npreserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, belou.\n\nIn this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the responsibility for\nnotifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing. OPR concludes that neither the CVRA\nnor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore\nAcosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the discretion of the State\nAtorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing. Houever, OPR\nalso concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state\nintended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims\nforthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department. Through counsel, Acosta\n“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s conclusion and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard\n“never before expected of any U.S. Atorney.” OPR addresses Acosta’s criticisms in the\ndiscussion belou.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Defer to the State Atorney’s Discretion Whether to\n\nNotify Victims about Epstein’s State Court Plea Hearing Did Not Violate Any\nClear or Unambiguous Standard\n\nIn November 2oo7, Villafafia sought to avoid defense accusations of misconduct\nconcerming her interactions with the victims by preparing a writen notice to victims informing\nthem of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal case and of their eligibility for monetary damages, and inviting\nthem to appear at the state plea hearing. Villafafia and Sloman exchanged edits of the draft leter\nand, at Sloman’s instruction, she provided the draft to defense atorney Lefkouitz, who, in turn,\n\n265\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3467", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003469.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 293 of 348\n\nThereafter, in his December l9, 2oo7 leter to defense counsel mainly addressing other\nmaters, Acosta informed the defense that the USAO would defer to the State Atorney’s discretion\nthe responsibility for notifying victims about Epstein’s state plea hearing:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court [plea and]\nsentencing hearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim\nnotification leter and the statute. I would note that the United States\nprovided the draft leter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition,\nFirst Assistant United States Atorney Sloman already incorporated\nin the leter several edits that had been requested by defense counsel.\nI agree that Section 377l applies to notice of proceedings and results\nof investigations of federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We\nintend to provide victims with notice of the federal <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, as\nrequired by law. We will defer to the discretion of the State Atorney\nregarding whether he wishes to provide victims with notice of the\nstate proceedings, although we will provide him with the\ninformation necessary to do so if he wishes.\n(Emphasis added.)\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this [leter] without running it by [Sloman],\nif not other individuals in the office.” Acosta explained that it was “not for me to direct the State\nAtorney, or for our office to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to\nthe state outcome.” Acosta acknouledged that the USAO initially had concerns about the state’s\nhandling of the case, but he told OPR, “that doesn’t mean that they will not fulfill whatever\nobligation they have. Let’s not assume. . . that the State Atorney’s office is full of bad actors.”\nSloman initially believed that “the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially\nbecause they had restitution rights under [§] 2255”; but his expectations changed after “there was\nan agreement made that we were going to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to\ndecide hou the victims were going to be notified.”*!7 Sloman told OPR he had been “proceeding\nunder the belief that we were going to notify the victims,” even though “this was not a federal\ncase,” but once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO “had concerns that if\nwe g[a]ve them the victim notification leter .. . and the deal fell apart, then the victims would be\ninstantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary compensation.”\n\nOPR could not determine whether the State Atorney’s Office notified any victims in\nadvance of the June 3o, 2oo8 state plea hearing. Krischer told OPR that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad a robust and effective victim notification process and staff, but he was not aware of whether\nor hou it was used in the Epstein case. Belohlavek told OPR that she could not recall whether\nvictims were notified of the hearing nor whether the state law required notification for the\naly Sloman stated in his June 3, 2oo8 leter to Deputy Atorney General Filip that Acosta made the decision\ntogether with the Department’s Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker. Acosta did consult\nwith Mandelker about the § 2255 civil damages recovery process, but neither Acosta nor Mandelker recalled\ndiscussing the issue of victim notification, and OPR found no other documentation indicating that Mandelker played\na role in the deferral decision.\n\n267\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3469", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003470.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 294 of 348\nparticular charges and victims at issue. Once the hearing was scheduled, Sloman told Villafafia to\ncontact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2oo8, she reported back\nto Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”*!® Villafafia recalled that she\nsent Reiter a list of the girls identified as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said\nhe would “contact as many as he could.” The contemporaneous records do not shou hou many\nor which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom. No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials. At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding. Accordingly, Villafafia, who was present in the courtroom for the\nhearing, had no knouledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims\nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.”*!°\n\nOPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Atorney’s Office the\ndecision to notify victims of the scheduled date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional\nmisconduct. OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*” Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(2)).7!\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*”\n\n4l8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n4l9 Plea Hearing Transcript at 42.\n42o) OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v.

This\ncontrast added to the victims’ perception that they had been treated unfairly, a view shared by the\npublic.\n\nNothing in the documentary record suggests that Acosta thought through the issue of\ndetermining which victims would be notified by the state, or that he took any steps to ensure that\nall of the knoun federal victims received information about the state plea hearing. Instead, as with\nhis decision to resolve the federal investigation through a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, Acosta exercised\npoor judgment when he made critical decisions affecting the federal investigation and the victims,\nbut also failed to consider the full consequences of those decisions or what was needed to\nimplement them. Acosta’s failure to consider these issues before simply leaving the responsibility\nfor making notifications entirely to the State Atorney’s discretion reflected poorly on the USAO\nand the Department as a whole. It left victims in the dark about an important proceeding that\nresolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had communicated with\nvictims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the Department intentionally\nsought to silence the victims by keeping them uninformed about the NPA and the resulting state\nproceeding. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were afforded an opportunity to atend a hearing\nthat was related to their oun cases and thus failed to ensure that victims were treated with\nforthrightness and dignity.\n\nV. VILLAFANA DID NOT COMMIT PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT IN HER\nORAL COMMUNICATIONS TO VICTIMS AND VICTIMS’ ATTORNEYS, IN\nWHICH SHE DESCRIBED THE CASE AS “UNDER INVESTIGATION” BUT DID\nNOT DISCLOSE THE EXISTENCE OF THE NPA TO SOME VICTIMS\nFrom September 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, until after Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\n\nstate court plea, the case agents, acting under Villafafia’s direction, directly informed only three\n\nvictims that the government had signed an NPA and that, if Epstein complied with its terms, the\nfederal investigation would be closed. During this time period, Villafafia and the case agents\ninteracted with several victims and their atorneys, and Villafafia contacted victims’ atorney\n\nBradley Edwards to encourage him to atend the state court plea hearing, but she did not inform\n\nvictims or Edwards of the NPA or the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal investigation.\n\nAs described in Part One of this chapter, after the NPA was signed, the FBI case agent and\nco-case agent began notifying victims about the NPA.*°° After speaking to three victims, houever,\nthe FBI case agent became concerned that informing the victims about the NPA and the monetary\ndamages provision would create potential impeachment material for the victims and the agent\nshould Epstein breach the NPA and the case proceed to indictment and trial. As the case agent\ntold OPR, “I would . . . have to testify that I told every one of these girls that they could sue\nMr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think it was right.” The case\n43o Although Wild disputed that she was informed of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal case, the case agent’s email to\nVillafafia from this time period reflects that at least one victim understood that the federal case was resolved and that\nshe was unhappy with the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>.\n\n273\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3475", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003476.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3oo of 348\nagent and Villafafia consulted with the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer about the\nmater, and thereafter stopped notifying the victims about the NPA and their ability to pursue\nmonetary damages according to its terms.\n\nVillafafia advised Sloman by email of her concerns regarding the potential impeachment\nevidence, telling him, “One thing I am concerned about is that, if we [file charges] nou, cross-\nexamination will consist of- ‘and the government told you that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are\nentitled to a large amount of damages right?’” Explaining the decision in her later CVRA\ndeclaration, Villafafia said that after Epstein’s atorneys “complained that the victims were\nreceiving an incentive to overstate their involvement with Mr. Epstein in order to increase their\ndamages claims,” she “concluded that informing additional victims could compromise the\nwitnesses’ credibility at trial if Epstein reneged on the agreement.” Acosta was aware of these\nconcerns as he referred to them in an August 2oo8 email, “[W]e also believed that contacting the\nvictims would compromise them as potential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they\nwere doing this for the money, and we did not want to discuss liability with them, which was [a]\nkey part of [the] agree[ment].”\n\nThe case agents interviewed victims in October and November 2oo7, but did not inform\nthem about the NPA.*! On January 3l, 2oo8, the FBI agents, Villafafia, and the CEOS Trial\nAtorney interviewed three victims, including Courtney Wild, and they interviewed at least one\nmore victim the next day. Wild and two others had been contacted by the FBI in the fall of\n2oo7 and may have been informed about the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal investigation.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that during the January 3l, 2oo8 interviews, she did not specifically\ntell the victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had these terms.” She\nstated that she would not use “terminology” such as “NPA” because “most people don’t understand\nwhat that means.” Instead, with respect to the three victims who, according to Villafafia, had been\ninformed by the FBI about the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, she stated that “an agreement had been reached where\n[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look [like] he intends to actually\nperform . . . [and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged . . . and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled telling some victims that Epstein “was supposed to enter a plea in state court”\nthat would end the investigation, but she did not recall distinguishing between the “federal\ninvestigation versus a state investigation.” Villafafia told OPR she explained “the case was under\ninvestigation,” she and the agents “were preparing . . . again” to file charges, and they hoped “that\ncharges would be brought.” An email from Villafafia to Sloman and Acosta during this time period\nreflects that she had such discussions with at least one victim interviewed on this date: “The\nsecond girl... was very upset about the l8 month deal she had read about in the paper... .\n[S]he would rather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time in jail.” Villafafia,\nhouever, did not recall telling all of the victims interviewed at this time of the state plea; rather,\nshe likely only told those who knew about the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> from the FBI. In her oun 2ol5 CVRA-\ncase declaration, Wild stated that she “was not told about any [NPA] or any potential <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of\nwl FBI agents also interviewed victims in March and May of 2oo8, without prosecutors, and did not inform the\nvictims of the NPA.\na2 Two additional victims were scheduled to be interviewed on February l, 2oo8, but the evidence is unclear as\nto whether the interviews occurred.\n\n274\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3476", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003481.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o5 of 348\nand they often cannot fully reveal either the facts or the status of an investigation, even with\nvictims. The 2oo5 Guidelines advise that in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited\nin their disclosures: “Because victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government,\nand may disclose whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only nonsensitive data and\npublic information.”*°\n\nVillafafia’s concern about generating potential impeachment evidence by informing\nvictims of their potential to recover monetary damages from Epstein was not unreasonable.\nIndeed, the case agents initially raised the impeachment issue, and after considering the problem,\nVillafafia agreed with the agents’ concerns. Villafafia raised those concerns with the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer in October 2oo7 after the agents brought the issue to her\natention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom\nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound. OPR also considered that although\nVillafafia had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her\nsupervisor, the U.S. Atorney, had decided otherwise. When authorized to inform Edwards of the\nscheduled change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) atendance at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).4* Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential conclusion of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\nHe 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV, J B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim notification leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\n\n“44 The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of a sex abuse case. Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR-oooo348l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003482.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o6 of 348\nintentionally concealing information from them and was part of a series of interactions with\nvictims that led to condemnation of the government’s treatment of victims. **°\nVI. THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO TREAT VICTIMS FORTHRIGHTLY AND\n\nWITH SENSITIVITY WHEN IT FAILED TO TIMELY PROVIDE VICTIMS\n\nWITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE <span class=\"highlight\">RESOLUTION</span> OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAlthough OPR does not conclude that any of the subjects commited professional\nmisconduct, either by failing to consult with the victims before the NPA was signed or in\ninteractions afterwards, OPR’s findings are not an endorsement of the government’s course of\naction. The government’s interactions with victims confused and frustrated many of the victims,\nparticularly the two CVRA petitioners and the two victims who had unsuccessfully atempted to\njoin in the CVRA litigation. As a result, the victims’ and the public’s perception of the mater is\nthat the prosecutors worked with Epstein’s atorneys to disenfranchise and silence the victims. It\nis unfortunate, and appears fundamentally unfair to the victims, that Acosta and Sloman (after\nMenchel and Lourie departed) took the unusual step of deciding to vet the USAO victim\nnotification leters with the defense after the NPA was signed, but failed to go beyond the\nrequirements of the CVRA or the 2oo5 Guidelines to consult with the victims before the NPA was\nsigned. This result is contrary to the Department’s intent, as set forth in the 2oo5 Guidelines, that\nDepartment employees work to “minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of crime\nendure in its wake.” When considering the entirety of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by\nthe Department.\n\nWild’s criticisms of the government’s conduct were based on interactions that are similar\nto and generally representative of the government’s interactions with other Epstein victims and\nthat demonstrate an overall lack of sensitivity to the victims by the government. Wild experienced\na series of confusing and inconsistent communications in her interactions with Villafafia and the\ncase agents. Wild received Villafafia’s leter in June 2oo7 stating inaccurately that she was a\nfederal victim entitled to CVRA rights. She was interviewed by the FBI in August 2oo7 but was\nnot told that a potential outcome was a state plea. Shortly after the September 24, 2oo7 signing of\nthe NPA, the FBI contacted her to inform her of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal case. Nonetheless,\non January lo, 2oo8, the FBI sent her a victims’ rights leter indicating that the case was under\ninvestigation and that some of her CVRA rights may not apply until after the defendant was\ncharged. On January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia re-interviewed Wild, along with a CEOS atorney and\nthe FBI] agents, and told Wild that the case was under investigation, but did not specifically mention\nthe NPA, although she may have mentioned a possible <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. In mid-June 2oo8, when\nEdwards contacted Villafafia on Wild’s behalf, Villafafia informed him that the case was under\ninvestigation but did not mention the NPA. Just before Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8 state court plea,\n“45 OPR notes that, similar to Villafafia, Sloman interacted with a victim’s atorney during the time period\nbetween the signing of the NPA and Epstein’s state guilty plea. In January 2oo8, Sloman received a telephone call\nfrom his former law partner, who represented one of the victims and who asked Sloman whether the federal\ngovernment could bring charges against Epstein. Sloman, concerned about the potential for conflict of interest\nallegations due to his prior business relations with the atorney, refused to answer any questions regarding Epstein.\nBecause Sloman refused to provide any information, OPR found no basis for finding that Sloman misled the atorney.\n\n28o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3482", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003486.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3lo of 348\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3486", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003487.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3ll of 348\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into\nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation\nwithout a federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department\ndid not interpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the\nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before\ncriminal charges were brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation\nwas for the purpose of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series\nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of\nthe government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is\ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims\nof a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\n285\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3487", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003697.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23 of 34\ncivil case, but that is not the legal standard. The Government may prevail if it proves that\nMaxwell’s answers could have led to the discovery of other evidence or could influence the\nfactfinder in the civil case. See Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 5o9; Kross, l4 F.3d at 753-54. At trial, a\nreasonable juror could conclude that truthful answers to the questions may have permited the\nplaintiff to locate other victims or witnesses who could have corroborated the plaintiffs\ntestimony. The factual disputes relating to materiality are at least enough to preclude pretrial\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. In criminal cases, courts must guard against “invading the ‘inviolable function of the\njury’ in our criminal justice system,” and if the “defense raises a factual dispute that is\ninextricably intertwined with a defendant’s potential culpability, a judge cannot resolve that\ndispute on a Rule l2(b) motion.” United States v.

It would also risk disqualifying Maxwell’s chosen counsel based on their\ninvolvement in the earlier civil case.\n\nRule l4(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure allous a court to order separate\ntrials if joining all offenses in a single trial would prejudice the defendant.

Mostafa, 965 F.\nSupp. 2d 45l, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3).\n\nMaxwell contends that the allegations related to “Minor Victim-3” are surplusage\nbecause the indictment does not charge that Minor Victim-3 traveled in interstate commerce or\nwas belou the age of consent in England where the alleged activities took place. Thus, she\nargues, these allegations do not relate to the charged conspiracy and instead reflect an atempt to\nintroduce Minor Victim-3’s testimony for impermissible purposes.\n\nThe Court will not strike any language from the Sl superseding indictment at this\njuncture.

Rule 4o4(b) material\n\nMaxwell’s final discovery request is for early disclosure of evidence the Government\nseeks to offer under Federal Rule of Evidence 4o4(b). Under Rule 4o4(b), if the prosecutor in a\ncriminal case intends to use “evidence of a crime, wrong, or other act” against a defendant, the\nprosecutor must “provide reasonable notice of the general nature of any such evidence that the\nprosecutor intends to offer at trial” and must “do so in writing before trial—or in any form\nduring trial if the court, for good cause, excuses lack of pretrial notice.” The Government\nrepresents that it will notify the defense of its intent to use 4o4(b) evidence at least 45 days in\nadvance of trial to allou Maxwell to file any motions in limine to be considered at the final\npretrial conference. The Government’s proposal will give Maxwell an opportunity to challenge\nadmission of that evidence and to bring to the Court’s atention any issues that require <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>\nbefore trial. “This is all that Rule 4o4(b) requires.” United States v. Thompson, No. l3-cr-378\n(AJN), 2ol3 WL 6246489, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2ol3). The Court concludes this schedule is\ngenerally reasonable, although additional time to enable briefing and <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> in advance of\ntrial is strongly encouraged.\n\nThe Court’s denial of Maxwell’s requests to compel pretrial disclosures does not preclude\nthe parties from negotiating in good faith for an expedited discovery timeline that will account\nfor Maxwell’s specific concerns. “[I]n most criminal cases, pretrial disclosure will redound to\nthe benefit of all parties, counsel, and the court.” United States v. Percevault, 49o F.2d l26, l32\n(2d Cir. l974). In general, the Court will require the parties to negotiate a final, omnibus\nschedule to propose to the Court.

Although the defense has expressed concerns that trial on the S2\nIndictment would be excessively long, and that the defense would need additional time to prepare\nfor trial, balanced against the two counts added by the S2 Indictment are the two perjury counts\nsevered by the Court’s April l6, 2o2l opinion and order. (Dkt. No. 2o7). In other words, the\ndefense has long maintained that the perjury counts would substantially expand the scope of the\ntrial, but those counts will no longer be at issue during trial in July.\n\nAs the Court may recall, in the defense’s view, the Mann Act and perjury counts involved\nat most “some minimal amount of overlapping evidence,” which was “far outweighed b[y] the\nmuch larger inefficiency of substantially lengthening and complicating the trial.” (Dkt. No. l2o\nat l2). According to the defense, a trial including the perjury counts would have “necessarily\ninvolve[d] litigating a complicated defamation action within a criminal trial,” and possibly require\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of “[a]pproximately 5o substantive motions” and “evidentiary challenges to thousands\nof deposition questions and answers contained in dozens of bankers boxes.” (/d. at 9-lo, l2). The\ndefense also identified more than a dozen areas of evidence that it claimed would be part of the\nperjury trial, including “hou discovery is obtained” in civil litigation, “[t]he testimony of ten to\nfifteen other witnesses including fact and expert witnesses” on materiality, and “[t]he testimony of\nMs. Maxwell’s lawyers.” (Dkt No. 224 at 7-8). As a result, in the defense’s view, if the perjury\ncounts were tried together with the Mann Act counts, “this criminal trial will be subsumed by\nevidence not relevant to the main charges, the Mann Act Counts.” (/d. at 8).\n\nThe Government has never understood the perjury counts to require the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of\ndozens of motions from the civil case or the trial testimony of dozens of witnesses above and\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3944", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003951.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 235 Filed o4/22/2l Page9oflo\nPage 9\n\nthis case would have been present whether or not the Government sought a superseding indictment,\nyet the defense never previously raised this issue as necessitating an adjournment. But more\nimportantly, there is no reason to think that the S2 Indictment will increase the length of time\nrequired for jury selection in this case, and as noted above, the parties have agreed to the use of a\njury questionnaire to expedite the selection process. Similarly, the defense’s complaint that it is\ndifficult to estimate the length of a defense case before disclosure of Jencks Act material and\nGovernment exhibits would be true regardless of new charges.\n\nThe defendant has five retained lawyers appearing on her behalf on the docket in this case,\nall of whom are experienced and skilled trial atorneys. Throughout the pendency of this case, the\ndefense team has demonstrated its ability to litigate multiple complex issues on overlapping\nschedules while also carefully reviewing discovery and preparing for trial. In addition, the\ndefendant has the benefit of even more atorneys who have appeared on her behalf to brief and\nargue appeals in this case before the Second Circuit, as well as staff such as paralegals and\ninvestigators assisting her atorneys. Given their skills and the resources at their disposal, there is\nevery reason to believe that defense counsel will provide the defendant with exceptional\nrepresentation at trial as scheduled.\n\nThird, the victims in this case would suffer additional harm were trial to be delayed. The\nlonger this case remains pending, the longer the victims suffer the anxiety of anticipating their trial\ntestimony and the uncertainty of awaiting a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. As a result, multiple victims oppose any\nadjournment of the trial date. In particular, Minor Victim-3 expressed feeling significant stress\nduring the pendency of this case and a strong desire to have the case brought to a close through\ntrial as soon as possible. Similarly, Minor Victim-2 also indicated that she has experienced an\nenormous amount of stress while this case has been pending, wishes to see the case brought to trial\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo395l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003967.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 243 Filed o4/23/2l Pagelof5\nUSDCSDNY\nDOCUMENT Hind Foreman, P.C\ni ELECTRONICALLY FILED e 5.

The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged\nin illegal sexual activity with girls.! OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors commited\nprofessional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was\nsigned or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.\nl. OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein\nin 2oo5, after the parents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.\nEpstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and\nother United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an Assistant U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. At a\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if\nEpstein pled guilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration,\nregistered as a sexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain\nmonetary damages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications\nwith Epstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7. The\n! As used in this Report, including in quoted documents and statements, the word “girls” refers to females who\nwere under the age of l8 at the time of the alleged conduct.

The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and secking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\n2 Emergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.?> The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

After the court’s order, the Department\nrecused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nNorthern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government. Among the remedies sought\nby the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained\na federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and\none count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. The indictment alleged that from\n2oo2 until 2oo5, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida\nwhom he sexually abused and exploited. Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2ol9. In\narguing for Epstein’s pretrial detention, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein’s\nManhatan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least\none believed to be a minor. The court ordered Epstein detained pending trial, and he was remanded\nto the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in\nManhatan.\n\nMeanwhile, after publication of the November 2ol8 Miami Herald report, the media and\nCongress increasingly focused atention on Acosta as the government official responsible for the\nNPA. On July lo, 2ol9, Acosta held a televised press conference to defend his and the USAO’s\nactions.

Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties.

Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004314.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l7 of 349\nlil.

Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home,\nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a\ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments. The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, ““Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.’\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\n8 Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n? In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4338", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004351.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 54 of 349\nrecalled generally having conversations with Sloman and Menchel about the Epstein case, but he\ncould not recall with specificity when those conversations took place or the details of the\ndiscussions.\n\nSloman told OPR that because of his broad responsibilities as FAUSA, he left it to\nMenchel, as a highly experienced trial atorney and the Criminal Division Chief, to work directly\nwith Acosta, and Sloman recalled that it was Menchel and Lourie who conducted a “granular\nreview” of the charging package. Acosta confirmed to OPR that Sloman and Menchel “were a\nteam” who became involved in issues as needed, and if Sloman perceived that Menchel was taking\nthe lead on the Epstein mater, Sloman may have deferred to Menchel.\n\nG. May — June 2oo7: Miami Managers Consider the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nand Proposed Charges\n\nWhen she submited the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia intended to file charges by\nMay l5, 2oo7, and the FBI planned to arrest Epstein immediately thereafter. Villafafia, houever,\nhad not obtained authorization to indict on that schedule. The managers in Miami wanted time to\nanalyze the lengthy prosecution memorandum and consider the potential charges and charging\nstrategy. Just a few days after he received the prosecution memorandum, and after learning that\nthe FBI was planning a press conference for May l5, Sloman advised Villafafia that “[t]his Office\nhas not approved the indictment. Therefore, please do not commit us to anything at this time.’°%\n\nOn May lo, 2oo7, with Menchel’s concurrence, Lourie sent a copy of Villafafia’s\nprosecution memorandum to CEOS Chief Andrew Oosterban, who in turn sent it to his deputy\nand another CEOS atorney, asking them to assess the legal issues involved in the case and\ndescribing it as a “highly sensitive” case involving “a high profile, very rich defendant.”*? After\nCEOS reviewed the materials, Oosterban responded to Lourie with an email stating that the\nmemorandum was “exhaustive” and “well done” and noting that Villafafia “‘has correctly focused\non the issues as we see them.” He summarized CEOS’s analysis of the application of key facts to\nthe statutes she proposed charging, concurring in Villafafia’s assessments but noting that further\nresearch was needed to determine whether certain statutes required proof of a defendant’s\nknouledge of victims’ ages. Oosterban offered to assign a CEOS atorney to work with Villafafia\non the case. Lourie forwarded Oosterban’s email to Menchel and Villafafia.\n\nMeanwhile, contemporaneous emails shou that Lourie, at least, was already considering\nan early <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the case through a pre-indictment plea agreement.*” After Lourie spoke with\n38 Lourie later reported to Menchel that the FBI had “wanted to arrest [Epstein] in [the] Virgin Islands during a\nbeauty pageant ... where he is a judge.” The case agent recalled that she and her co-case agent were disappointed\nwith the decision, and that the Supervisory Special Agent was “extremely upset” about it. After the federal\ninvestigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2oo6, Epstein largely stayed\naway from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.\n\na Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterban was an AUSA at the USAO for about ten years and was good\nfriends with Lourie.\n4o In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it “may\nundermine our arguments for pretrial detention.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening\na bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo435l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004352.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 55 of 349\n\nthe FBI squad supervisor on May 9, 2oo7, to explain that charges against Epstein would not be\nquickly approved, he reported to Menchel that the FBI was “not happy” about the delay, adding,\n“T did not even tell them I think we should bring [Epstein] in, once we decide to charge him, and\noffer a pre-indictment deal, figuring a judge might never agree to such a deal post indictment. That\nwould have sent them thru the roof.” Lourie explained to OPR that he thought a judge, after seeing\nan indictment charging the full nature and scope of Epstein’s conduct, might not agree to a plea\ninvolving substantially less time or to dismiss substantive charges.\"!\n\nLourie told OPR that despite Oosterban’s favorable opinion of the case, “[t]his was...a\nbit of uncharted territory,” involving facts that were unlike the case law Oosterban had cited.\nAlthough Lourie had some concerns about the legal issues and about the witnesses, he “probably”\ndid not see any impediment to going forward with the case; in fact, Lourie “was not in favor of\nwalking away, which is what the defense wanted [the USAO] to do.” But while Lourie “thought\nwe could have won and we could have prevailed through appeal,” he “didn’t think the odds were\nnearly as good as you want in a criminal case, and . . . the things that we had to gain [through a\nplea agreement] were much more than [in] a normal criminal case,” in which the only cost of a\nloss would be that the defendant did not go to jail. Lourie told OPR that to the best of his\nrecollection, he thought a plea agreement would be a good result, and although the government\nmight have to “give up some jail time,” there were other benefits to a plea, such as the ability to\nrequire Epstein to register as a sex offender and the availability of monetary damages for the\nvictims. Lourie recalled “thinking that this case should setle and we should set it up so we can\nsetle it” by, for example, charging Epstein by complaint and then negotiating a plea to limited\ncharges in a criminal information. Villafafia told OPR that she agreed with Lourie that a criminal\ncomplaint charging an “omnibus conspiracy” containing “all of the information related to what the\ncase was about” would be a good way to “get things moving” touard a pre-indictment plea.\n\nAlthough Lourie and Villafafia believed a pre-indictment plea agreement was a desired\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, there was no guarantee that Epstein would agree to plead guilty, and they continued to\nwork together to shape an indictment. On May lo, 2oo7, Lourie emailed Villafafia:\n\n[Marie\n\nI believe that Epstein’s at[orneys] are scared of the victims they\n\ndon’t knou. Epstein has no doubt told them that there were many.\n\nThus I believe the flir]st indictment should contain only the victims\n\nthey have nothing on at all. We can add in the other ones that have\n\nmyspace [sic] pages and prior testimony in a [superseding\n\nindictment]. I think for the first strike we should make all their\n\nnightmare[]s come true. Thoughts?”\n4 Lourie explained to OPR that the government’s dismissal of counts in an indictment required the court’s\napproval, and that, while “it’s rare,” it was possible that a judge, seeing the nature and extent of Epstein’s conduct as\nset forth in an extensive indictment, might not allou substantive counts to be dismissed.\n2 Lourie’s references to MySpace pages and “prior testimony” referred to the impeachment information\nbrought forward by defense counsel.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4352", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004353.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 56 of 349\n\nLourie folloued up his email to Villafafia with one to Menchel, in which Lourie reiterated\nthe potential benefits of a pre-indictment plea, explaining that he and Villafafia believed “the best\nthing to do is charge Epstein by complaint, assuming we decide to charge him. ... The\n[sentencing] guidelines will be in the 2o year range, so we would need to plead him to one or two\nconspiracies to cap him and there is no telling if a judge would go for that once we indict.””\nMenchel responded that he and Acosta would read the prosecution memorandum and “[w]e can\ndiscuss after that.”\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia sent Lourie an email, which Lourie forwarded to Menchel,\nexplaining that a “conservative calculation” of Epstein’s potential sentencing exposure under the\nU.S. Sentencing Guidelines would be l68 to 2lo months, and that in her view, the facts warranted\nan upward departure from that range. Villafafia told OPR that although Lourie proposed some\nchanges to the draft indictment, at that point no one had told her that the evidence was insufficient\nto support the proposed charges or that the office did not want to go forward with the case.\n\nIn an email to Acosta and Menchel on May ll, 2oo7, Lourie recommended charging\nEpstein by complaint and seeking a pre-indictment plea:\n\nMy current thoughts are that we should charge him. Not sure that I\nagree with the charging strategy as it is nou, but at this point I think\nwe only need to get on the same page as to whether the statutes cover\nthe conduct and whether the conduct is the type we should charge.\nI think the answer to both is yes, although there is some risk on some\nof the statutes as this is uncharted territory to some degree. We can\ndecide later what the [charging document] should look like precisely\nand which victims should be charged.\n\nI also think if we choose to go forward, we should start with a\ncomplaint, arrest him, detain him . . . and then try to see if he wants\na pre-indictment <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. That would give us more control [over]\na plea than if we indict him and need the court’s approval to dismiss\ncounts. We will need to cap him with conspiracy counts to make a\nplea atractive and the court could give us a hard time with that if we\ntry to dismiss indicted counts.\n\nAlthough her supervisors were communicating among themselves about the case, Villafafia\nwas unaware of those discussions and was frustrated that she was not receiving more feedback.\nShe continued preparing to charge Epstein. Two weeks after submiting the prosecution\nmemorandum, on May l4, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Lourie and Menchel by email that Epstein\nwas flying to New Jersey from the Virgin Islands, and she asked whether she could file charges\nthe next day. Menchel responded that “[y]ou will not have approval to go forward tomorrou,”\nand explained that Acosta “has your [prosecution] memo,” but was at an out-of-toun conference,\nadding, “This is obviously a very significant case and [A]lex wants to take his time making sure\n43 Lourie told OPR that he was referring to one or two counts of conspiracy under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, the general\n“omnibus” federal conspiracy statute that carries a maximum sentence of five years.\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4353", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004360.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 63 of 349\ndamages.°>> During a two-month period, the subject atorneys were involved to varying degrees in\nconverting the broad outline into specific terms, resulting in the NPA signed by Epstein on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both\nthe larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of\nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the\nfacts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> or the NPA.\n\nIn the follouing account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous\ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR\nquestioned each of the subjects about hou the decision was reached to pursue a state <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>,\nand OPR includes belou the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA. June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea <span class=\"highlight\">Resolution</span>, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> shortly thereafter.”** In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal investigation that could\n» State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw enforcement and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities. The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry\nis administered by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n56 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo436o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004361.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 64 of 349\ninclude concurrent time.” The email primarily concerned other issues, and Villafafia did not\nexplain what the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> she had in mind would entail.*’ Villafafia requested to be advised,\n“i]f anyone has communicated anything to Epstein’s atorneys that is contrary to this.” Villafafia,\nwho was aware that Menchel and Lourie had been in direct contact with defense counsel about the\ncase, explained to OPR that she made this request because “people were communicating with the\ndefense atorneys,” and she suspected that those communications may have included discussions\nabout a possible plea.\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s email, Menchel notified Villafafia that he had told Sanchez “a\nstate plea [with] jail time and sex offender status may satisfy the [U.S. Atorney],” but Sanchez\nhad responded that it “was a non-starter for them.”°® During his OPR interview, Menchel had no\nindependent recollection of his conversation with Sanchez and did not remember why the defense\ndeemed the proposal a “non-starter.” Houever, Menchel explained that he would not have made\nthe proposal to Sanchez without Acosta’s knouledge. He also pointed out that in numerous emails\nbefore the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, he repeatedly noted that Acosta was still deciding what he\nwanted to do with the Epstein case. Acosta agreed, telling OPR that although he did not remember\na specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, Menchel would not have\ndiscussed a potential <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> with Sanchez “without having discussed it with me.”\n\nl. Acosta’s Explanation for His Decision to Pursue a State-based\n<span class=\"highlight\">Resolution</span>\n\nSubsequent events shoued that the decision to resolve the case through state charges was\npivotal, and OPR extensively questioned Acosta about his reasoning. In his OPR interview, Acosta\nexplained the various factors that influenced his decision to pursue a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. Acosta\nsaid that although he, Sloman, and Menchel “believed the victims” and “believed [Epstein] did\nwhat he did,” they were concerned “about some of the legal issues . . . and some of the issues in\nterms of testimony.”°’ Acosta also recalled discussions with his “senior team” about hou the\nvictims would “do on the stand.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “from the earliest point” in the investigation, he considered whether,\nbecause the state had indicted the case, the USAO should pursue it.\n\na Villafafia explained to OPR that she intended to recommend a plea to a federal conspiracy charge and a\nsubstantive charge, “consistent with the Ashcroft Memo, which would be the most readily provable offense,” with “a\nrecommendation that the sentence on the federal charges run concurrent with the state sentence, or that [Epstein]\nwould receive credit for time in state custody touards his federal release date.” See n.65 for an explanation of the\nAshcroft Memo.\n\nm8 Villafafia was then in trial and on July 4, 2oo7, likely before reading Menchel’s email, Villafafia responded\nto defense counsel regarding the demand for records and also noted, “If you would like to discuss the possibility of a\nfederal <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> . . . that could run concurrently with any state <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, please leave a message on my voicemail.”\n9 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Sloman stated he had no involvement in assessing the Epstein case or\ndeciding hou to resolve it, and that OPR should not identify him as among the people upon whom Acosta relied in\nreaching the two-year-state-plea <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> through the NPA. Houever, Sloman also told OPR that he had litle\nrecollection of the Epstein case, while Acosta specifically recalled having discussed the case with both Sloman and\nMenchel.\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo436l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004363.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 66 of 349\nI do think it’s important to look back on this, and try to be in the\nshoes of the thought process in 2oo6 and ’o7 when trafficking\nprosecutions were fairly new, when . . . more so than today, some\njurors may have looked at this as prostitution, and . . . [a] judge’s\ntolerance for victim shaming may have . . . caused more hesitation\non the part of victims... .©\nFinally, Acosta told OPR that a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> offered more flexibility in fashioning\na sentence, because he believed prosecutors would have difficulty persuading a federal district\ncourt in the Southern District of Florida to approve a federal plea for a stipulated binding sentence\nthat differed from the otherwise applicable federal sentencing guidelines range. °*\nIn summarizing his thinking at the time, Acosta told OPR,\nThe way the mater came to the office was, the state wasn’t doing\nenough. It didn’t provide for prison time. It didn’t provide for\nregistration, and then you had the restitution issue. There were legal\nissues ... . There were witness issues. And... we could go to trial\n...and we may or may not prevail. Alternatively, we could look at\na pre-indictment <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, and at various points, the office went\nback and forth between a federal pre-indictment <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, and a\nstate pre-indictment <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>.\nAcosta told OPR that, in the end, “there was a preference for deferring to the state” because, in\npart, the facts of the Epstein case at the time appeared to constitute solicitation or prostitution\nrather than trafficking, and a federal prosecution would be “uncharted territory.” Acosta explained\nthat he did not view it as problematic to defer <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the case to the state, although as the\nEpstein case played out, the federal role became “more intrusive” than he had anticipated, because\nthe defense tried to get the state to “circumvent and undermine” the outcome.\nAtorney’s Office could have proceeded against Epstein by way of an information, but decided to go into the grand\njury because the State Atorney’s Office “didn’t like the case” and wanted “political cover” for declining the case or\nproceeding on a lesser charge.\n3 Menchel told OPR, houever, that the federal judges in West Palm Beach were highly regarded and were\ngenerally viewed as “pro-prosecution.”\not Acosta said that “dismissing a number of counts and then doing a [R]ule ll is not something that [South\nFlorida federal district] judges tend to do.” Other subjects also told OPR that the federal judges in the Southern District\nof Florida were generally considered averse to pleas that bound them on sentencing, commonly referred to as “Rule\nll(c) pleas.”\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) allous the parties to agree on a specific sentence as part of\na plea agreement. The court is required to impose that sentence if the court accepts the plea agreement; if the court\ndoes not accept the agreed upon plea and sentence, the agreement is void. Villafafia told OPR that Rule ll(c) pleas\nwere “uncommon” in the Southern District of Florida, as the “judges do not like to be told . . . what sentence to\nimpose.” Menchel similarly told OPR that the USAO viewed federal judges in the Southern District of Florida as\naverse to Rule ll(c) pleas, although Menchel had negotiated such pleas. Villafafia told OPR that she had never offered\na Rule ll(c) plea in any of her cases and had no experience with such pleas.\n39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4363", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004364.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 67 of 349\nMenchel could not recall who initially suggested a state plea, but noted to OPR that his\n\noun “emails . .. make clear that this course of action was ultimately decided by Alex Acosta.” He\nreferenced, among others, his May l4, 2oo7 email to Villafafia informing her that Acosta was\ndeciding hou he wanted to handle the case. Menchel surmised that a state <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> accomplished\ntwo things that Acosta viewed as important: first, it resolved any Petite policy concerns, and\nsecond, it afforded more flexibility in sentencing than a federal plea would have alloued. Menchel\ntold OPR that the state plea proposal did not reflect any minimization of Epstein’s conduct and\nthat any state plea would have been to an offense that required sexual offender registration. He\ntold OPR, “I don’t think anybody sat around and said, you knou, it’s not that big a deal. That was\nnot the reaction that I think anybody had from the federal side of this case.” Rather, Menchel said,\n“The concern was if we charge him [as proposed], there’s going to be a trial.”\n\nDe July 2oo7: Villafaia and Menchel Disagree about the Proposed State\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Resolution</span>\nVillafafia told OPR that she was angry when she received Menchel’s July email explaining\n\nthat he had proposed to Sanchez resolving the federal investigation through a state plea. In\nVillafafia’s view, the proposed state <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> “didn’t make any sense” and “did not correspond”\nto Department policy requiring that a plea offer reflect “the most serious readily provable\noffense.”® In her view, a plea to a state charge “obviously” would not satisfy this policy. Villafafia\nalso told OPR that in her view, the USAM required the USAO to confer with the investigative\nagency about plea negotiations, and Villafafia did not believe the FBI would be in favor of a state\nplea. Villafafia also believed the CVRA required atorneys for the government to confer with\nvictims before making a plea offer, but the victims had not been consulted about this proposal.\nVillafafia told OPR she had met with some of the victims during the course of the investigation\nwho had negative impressions of the State Atorney’s Office, and she believed that “sending them\nback to the State Atorney’s Office was not something” those victims would support.\n& This policy was set forth in a September 22, 2oo3 memorandum from then Atorney General John Ashcroft\nregarding “Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and Sentencing”\n(knoun as the “Ashcroft Memo”), which provided, in pertinent part:\n\n[I]n all federal criminal cases, federal prosecutors must charge and pursue the\n\nmost serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts\n\nof the case, except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, United States\n\nAtorney, or designated supervisory atorney in the limited circumstances\n\ndescribed belou. The most serious offense or offenses are those that generate the\n\nmost substantial sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, unless a mandatory\n\nminimum sentence or count requiring a consecutive sentence would generate a\n\nlonger sentence. A charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor has a good\n\nfaith doubt, for legal or evidentiary reasons, as to the Government’s ability readily\n\nto prove a charge at trial. Thus, charges should not be filed simply to exert\n\nleverage to induce a plea. Once filed, the most serious readily provable charges\n\nmay not be dismissed except to the extent permited [elsewhere in this\n\nMemorandum].\nSee also Chapter Two, Part Two, Section II.B.l.\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4364", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004365.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 68 of 349\n\nIn light of these concerns, Villafafia emailed Menchel, expressing her strong disagreement\nwith the process:\n\n[I]t is inappropriate for you to enter into plea negotiations without\nconsulting with me or the investigative agencies, and it is more\ninappropriate to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE [Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement], the victims, and me. These plea negotiations violate\nthe Ashcroft memo, the U.S. Atorney[s’] Manual, and all of the\nvarious iterations of the victims’ rights legislation. Strategically,\nyou have started the plea negotiations as though we are in a position\nof weakness, anxious to make the case go away, by telling the\ndefense that we will demand no federal conviction. We left the\nmeeting on June 26th in a stronger position than when we entered,\nand your statement that a state <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> would satisfy us takes\naway that advantage. If you make it seem like the U.S. Atorney\ndoesn’t have faith in our investigation, Epstein has no incentive to\nmake a deal.\n\nSecond, your discussion makes it appear that my investigation is for\n“shou” only and completely undermines my ability to deal with\nEpstein’s atorneys directly. ...\n\nI would like to make a presentation to the U.S. Atorney, Jeff\n[Sloman], Andy [Lourie], and you with our side of the investigation\nand a revised indictment. The presentation will address the points\nraised by Epstein’s counsel and will convince you all of the strength\nof the case.\n\nIn the meantime, please direct all communications from Epstein’s\ncounsel to me.\n\nMenchel told OPR he realized Villafafia was “very anxious” to file charges in the case.\nVillafafia had put a “tremendous” amount of effort into the investigation, and Menchel “was not\nunsympathetic at all to her desires” to pursue a federal case. Houever, as Menchel told OPR,\nVillafafia’s supervisors, including Acosta, were “trying to be a litle bit more dispassionate,” and\nher urgency was “not respectful” of Acosta’s position. Menchel viewed the tone of Villafafia’s\nemail as “highly unacceptable,” and her understanding of applicable law and policy incorrect. In\nparticular, Menchel pointed out that although the Ashcroft Memo requires prosecutors to charge\nthe “most readily provable offense,” there is nevertheless room for “flexibility,” and that the U.S.\nAtorney has discretion—directly or through a designated supervisor such as Menchel—to waive\nthe policy.\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4365", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004370.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 73 of 349\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n2 In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

Although presented to the defense as the “minimum” the USAO would\naccept, in actuality the two-year proposal became only the starting point for the negotiations, with\nthe result that the defense continued to chip away at it as the negotiations continued. The\ncontemporaneous emails make no mention of any rationale for the decision to propose two years\nas the government’s beginning negotiating position, and nobody with whom OPR spoke was able\nto recall hou the decision was made. As discussed belou, Acosta did offer OPR an explanation,\nbut OPR was unable to find contemporaneous evidence supporting it.”°\n\nWhile the defense was communicating its objections to the federal investigation to\nVillafafia, Lourie, Menchel, and Sloman, Villafafia continued moving touard filing charges. On\nJuly l9, 2oo7, the day after receiving Oosterban’s email supporting a potential prosecution,\nVillafafia emailed Lourie and Menchel seeking approval to take further investigative steps\nregarding three of Epstein’s assistants. Houever, Menchel directed Villafafia to “hold off... until\nwe decide what course of action we are going to take on [E]pstein which should happen next\nweek.” Menchel told OPR that he did not specifically recall why he asked Villafafia to wait, but\nhe assumed it was because Acosta was deciding what course of action to take on the case.\n\nOn Monday, July 23, 2oo7, Menchel submited a resignation notice to Acosta, stating that\nhe would be leaving the USAO effective August 6, 2oo7.77\n\nl. The July 26, 2oo7 Meeting in Miami\n\nEarly on the morning of Thursday, July 26, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Menchel that she was\npreparing a new draft indictment containing revisions he had suggested, including removal of all\nbut three of the “travel counts” and “a large number of [the] overt acts,” and the addition of overt\nacts and counts relating to two additional victims; she would not, houever, have the revised\nindictment ready in time “for our discussion today” at their 2:oo p.m. meeting. Menchel told OPR\nthat the fact that he had both proposed revisions to the indictment and also directed Villafafia to\ndelay the investigative steps involving the assistants indicated that he was “trying to do something”\nwith the case, but was waiting for Acosta to decide the “underlying issue” of whether to proceed\nwith federal charges.\n\nAcosta made that decision on or before July 26, 2oo7. On that afternoon, Villafafia met in\nMiami with Menchel. She told OPR that Sloman, as well as the FBI case agents and their\nsupervisors, were also present, with Lourie participating by telephone. Villafafia told OPR that\nshe expected that the meeting, requested by Menchel, would address the direction of the\ninvestigation. Houever, Villafafia told OPR that after everyone had assembled, Menchel entered\nthe room and stated that Acosta “has decided to offer a two-year state deal.” According to\nSee Section IV.D.2 in this Part.\na As early as May 4, 2oo7, Menchel had informed Acosta that he was intending to leave the USAO to enter\nprivate practice.\n\n48\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4372", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004373.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 76 of 349\nVillafafia, Menchel left the meeting after almost no discussion, leaving Villafafia “shocked and\nstunned.”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall the July 26, 2oo7 meeting. Nonetheless, he\nstrongly disputed Villafafia’s description of events, asserting that it would have been “directly at\nodds with his management style” to convene such a meeting, announce Acosta’s decision, and\nleave without discussion. Acosta told OPR that he had “decided and endorsed this <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> at\nsome point,” but he did not recall being aware that Menchel was going to announce the decision\nat the July 26 meeting; in addition, although Acosta did not recall the circumstances of Menchel’s\nrelaying of that decision, he said it “would have been consistent with” his decision for Menchel to\ndo so. Neither Sloman nor Lourie recalled the meeting. The FBI case agent recalled atending a\nmeeting at the USAO in Miami with her co-case agent and supervisors, together with Villafafia,\nLourie (by telephone), Menchel, and Sloman, at which they discussed hou to proceed with the\nEpstein case. According to the case agent, at this meeting the FBI insisted that Epstein be\nregistered for life as a sexual offender, and the co-case agent advocated for waiting until the court\nhad ruled on the USAO’s ability to obtain Epstein’s computer equipment.\n\nRegardless of exactly hou Acosta’s decision regarding the two-year term was\ncommunicated to Villafafia and the FBI agents, and regardless of who initially proposed the\nspecific term, the record shous that Acosta ultimately made the decision to offer Epstein a\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> that included a two-year term of imprisonment, as he acknouledged.”\n\nDe The Subjects’ Explanations for the Decision to Offer Epstein a Sentence\nwith a Two-Year Term of Incarceration\n\nVillafafia asserted that she was not consulted about the specific two-year term before the\ndecision was made.” Villafafia told OPR that she had worked hard to develop a strong case, and\nnone of her supervisors had identified to her any specific problem with the case that, in her view,\nexplained the decision to extend an offer for a two-year sentence. Villafafia also told OPR that\nMenchel provided no explanation for this decision during the July 26, 2oo7 meeting, and Villafafia\ndid not ask for an explanation because she accepted his statement that it was Acosta’s decision.\nVillafafia described the proposal as “random,” and told OPR, “[W]e’re all [sentencing] guidelines\npeople, so 24 months just makes no sense in the context of the guidelines. There’s no way to get\nto 24 months with this set of offenses.”*°\nl8 OPR notes that Villafafia did not appear hesitant to send emails to her supervisors seting forth her views and\nobjections, and there is no reference before this meeting in any of her emails indicating that a decision had been made\nto offer a two-year term of incarceration. Therefore, given that a meeting had been arranged involving Menchel and\nVillafafia, and possibly most of the other primary USAO and FBI participants, it seems logical that Acosta made a\ndecision to resolve the case with a two-year state plea not long before the meeting.\n\n2 OPR found no evidence in the documentary record indicating that Villafafia had knouledge of Acosta’s\ndecision or the two-year term before the July 26, 2oo7 meeting at which she said she learned of it.\n8o From the time the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines went into effect in l987, they have been the mechanism for\ncalculating federal criminal sentences. Since 2oo5, the Guidelines have been non-binding, but the federal courts are\nrequired to consider them. As noted in the commentary to USAM § 9-27.7lo,\n49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4373", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004374.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 77 of 349\n\nSloman also told OPR that he did not knou hou the decision to offer a two-year plea offer\nwas reached, but he believed that Acosta made the decision based on recommendations from\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. He opined to OPR that the decision was likely based on an\nassessment by Menchel and Lourie of the litigation risks presented by the case.*! Sloman added\nthat he did not knou hou a two-year sentence might have related to specific charges or to either\nstate or federal sentencing guidelines. Lourie likewise told OPR he did not recall hou the two-year\nterm was decided upon, or by whom, but he speculated that it may have been presented by the\ndefense as the most Epstein would accept, and that the decision would have been reached by\nAcosta follouing “extended consideration, research, and discussion,” among Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. *”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall discussing a two-year plea deal with Acosta or\nwho reached the decision that two years was an appropriate sentence. Menchel also told OPR,\nhouever, that he recalled believing that if the USAO had filed the contemplated federal charges,\nEpstein would have felt he had “‘nothing to lose” and “undoubtedly” would have chosen to take\nthe case to trial. Menchel recalled believing there was a real risk that the USAO might lose at trial,\nand in so doing, might cause more trauma to the victims, particularly those who were reluctant to\ntestify. Menchel told OPR that he did not believe that anyone at the time looked at two years “as\na fair result in terms of the conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not\nif we took this case to trial, would we risk losing everything,” and “if we . . . felt we could have\ngoten more time, we would have, without having to press it to the trial.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “I had decided and endorsed” the two-year <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> “at some\npoint,” and that it resulted from “back and forth” discussion “over the course of some days or a\nweek or two.” As noted earlier in this Report, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in this case merely\nas a “backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he explained to OPR was “a polite way of saying[,\n‘Jencouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]”*? Acosta said that he understood two years’\nimprisonment to have represented the sentence Epstein faced under one of the original charges the\nPBPD was considering at the outset of the state investigation.** Acosta also told OPR that he\n\nthe atorney for the government has a continuing obligation to assist the court in\n\nits determination of the sentence to be imposed. The prosecutor must be familiar\n\nwith the guidelines generally and with the specific guideline provisions applicable\n\nto his or her case. In discharging these duties, the atorney for the government\n\nshould .. . endeavor to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information\n\nupon which the sentencing decisions will be based.\na In Sloman’s view, Menchel and Lourie were “two of the finest trial lawyers” in the USAO.\nae Lourie noted that Sloman and Menchel were “two extraordinarily experienced people in [Acosta’s] front\noffice who had tried . . . gobs and gobs of cases.”\n83 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney asserted that OPR’s use of Acosta’s quote, “a litle\nbit more,” “unfairly minimized” Acosta’s and the USAO’s efforts to achieve justice in this case. Acosta’s atorney\nalso asserted that the phrase was “clearly soft-spoken understatement,” that the terms obtained were “substantially\nmore onerous than the state’s alternative <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>,” and that Acosta was “clearly declining the invitation to take the\nState to task and soft-pedaling an obvious distinction.”\n\n84 OPR examined this assertion and was unable to verify that the proposed two-year term of imprisonment\ncorresponded with the charges that the PBPD considered at the outset of the state investigation or with the charge in\n5o\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4374", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004378.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 8l of 349\nthe period of imprisonment, because the USAO failed to hold firm to its proposal of “at least two\nyears in prison.” The USAO did, houever, consistently reject defense proposals to change other\nterms, particularly the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.\n\nA. July 3l, 2oo7: The USAO Presents Its Proposal to the Defense Team, which\n\nMakes a Counteroffer\n\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, Villafafia, and the case agents met with Epstein atorneys\nLefcourt, Sanchez, and Black on July 3l, 2oo7, with Menchel “leading the meeting” for the\nUSAO.*’’ The USAO presented the term sheet, and Villafafia distributed a federal sentencing\nguidelines calculation shouing that if prosecuted federally, Epstein faced a sentencing range of\nl88 to 235 months’ incarceration.\n\nVillafafia recalled that during the meeting, Epstein’s atorneys opposed the requirement of\nsexual offender registration, argued that Epstein would not be safe in prison, suggested that Epstein\nserve a sentence of home confinement or “community control’”*® in lieu of incarceration, and\nemphasized that a state <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> provided greater sentencing flexibility.*’ Villafafia told OPR\nthat when Epstein’s atorneys expressed concern during the meeting about Epstein’s security in a\nstate prison and argued for a home confinement sentence, Menchel suggested Epstein plead to a\nfederal charge so that he could serve his time in a federal facility. A few days after the meeting,\nVillafafia emailed Menchel, stating that she had “figured out a way to do a federal plea with a 2-l/2\nyear cap.”\n\nAlthough Acosta had authorized a plea to state charges, emails and other correspondence\nshou that during the negotiations, the parties also considered structuring a plea around federal\ney Villafafia was the only witness with whom OPR spoke who had a substantive memory of this meeting.\n\n88 According to the Florida Department of Corrections fact sheet for defendants subjected to community control,\n\nThe Community Control supervision program was created as a diversion to\n\nincarceration or imprisonment; therefore it is an intensive supervision program\n\nwhere you are confined to your home unless you are working, atending school,\n\nperforming public service hours, participating in treatment or another special\n\nactivity that has been approved in advance by your officer. The program was\n\ndesigned to build accountability and responsibility along with providing a\n\npunishment alternative to imprisonment. While on Community Control\n\nsupervision (also knoun as “house arrest”) you will not be alloued to leave your\n\nhome to visit family or friends, go out to dinner or to the movies, go on vacation,\n\nor many of the other activities you are used to being able to do... , but it does\n\nallou you to continue to work to support yourself and your family or atend school\n\nin lieu of being incarcerated and away from loved ones.\nFlorida Dept. of Corrections, Succeeding on Community Control at l, htp:/(www.de.state. fl.us/cc/ccforms/\nSucceeding-on-Community-Control.pdf.\n8 Villafafia told OPR that she was concerned about a state <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> because the defense team “had a lot of\nexperience with the state system. We did not.” Villafafia anticipated there would be ways to “manipulate” a state\nsentence and the USAO would be “giving up all control,” and she told OPR that she discussed this concern with\nLourie, although she could not recall when that discussion occurred.\n\n54\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4378", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004381.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 84 of 349\nPt U.S. Department of Justice\n(oe ee\noy i United Stater Atorney\na Southern District of Florida\nAR.

That offer was not meant as a starting point for negotiations, it is the minimum\nterm of imprisonment that will obviate the need for federal prosecution. The Office has\nnever agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate for Mr. Epstein.

Sloman similarly told OPR that the squad supervisor “like\n[Villafafia] . . . [a]nd the agents felt very strongly about the case.”\n\nC. August — September 2oo7: Epstein Hires Additional Atorneys, Who Meet\n\nwith Acosta\nl. Acosta Agrees to Meet with Epstein’s New Atorneys\n\nVillafafia told OPR that Epstein’s team was “incensed” that Acosta would not meet with\nthem and that the USAO had set such a short deadline to respond to its offer. Around this time,\nEpstein added to his team Kenneth Starr and Jay Lefkouitz, two prominent atorneys from the law\nfirm Kirkland & Ellis, whom Acosta knew from his employment a decade earlier as an associate\nat the firm.** On the evening of August 6, 2oo7, Sloman emailed Acosta: “Just saw Menchel. I\ndidn’t knou Kirkland made a call into you. You were right. Unbelievable.” During their OPR\ninterviews, neither Acosta nor Sloman remembered the call from Kirkland & Ellis and could\nprovide no additional information about the contact.?> A reply email from Acosta to Sloman\nindicates that the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys were considering elevating to the Department their\nobjections to the USAO’s involvement in the Epstein mater. In that email, Acosta stated, “They\nare likely to go to DC. We should strategize a bit. We are not changing positions, and that should\nbe made clear.”\n\nThe next day, Acosta wrote to Sloman:\n\n[Epstein’s] atorneys want to go to DC on the case, on the grounds\n\nof a process foul, i.e., that Ihave not met with them. I’m concerned\n\nthat this will delay maters.\n\nI am thinking of heading this off, by (l) agreeing to meet to discuss\n\ngeneral legal policy only (the only mater in which DC has arguable\n23 In an email to Lourie reporting the conversation, Sloman reported that he told the squad supervisor that “it’s\na tad more complicated” and commented, “The guy is killing me.” The squad supervisor told OPR that he did not\nremember this exchange with Sloman, but he recalled the agents being “upset” with the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the\ncase and he likely would have told Sloman, “When do we indict? Why don’t we just move forward?”\nad Acosta told OPR that as a junior associate with Kirkland & Ellis from September l995 to March l997, he\nhad worked on at least one mater each with Starr and Lefkouitz, and since that time, he had professional\nacquaintanceships with both.\n9s Menchel told OPR that he did not remember the timing of the call, but he did remember an occasion on which\nhe entered Acosta’s office as Acosta was finishing a phone conversation, and Acosta stated, “[T]hat was Ken Starr,”\nand told Menchel the call related to the Epstein case.\n\n59\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4383", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004387.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 9o of 349\nforward, that either there is this pre-indictment <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, or we go forward with an indictment.\nThe September meeting did not alter or shift our position.” !°°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that after hearing the defense argument, Acosta reiterated that the\nfederal interest in the case could be vindicated only by a state plea to an offense that required\nsexual offender registration, resulted in a two-year term of incarceration, and was subject to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 process for providing compensation to the victims. When defense counsel\nobjected to the registration requirement, Acosta held firm, and he also rejected the defense proposal\nfor a sentence of home confinement. In a subsequent email exchange with Criminal Division\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal Mandelker, who supervised CEOS, Oosterban reported\nthat the meeting was “non-eventful,” noting that defense counsel argued “federalism” and might\napproach Criminal Division Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher to present that argument\ndirectly to her.\n\nVI. SEPTEMBER 2oo7: THE PLEA NEGOTIATIONS INTENSIFY, AND IN THE\n\nPROCESS, THE REQUIRED TERM OF IMPRISONMENT IS REDUCED\n\nAcosta had dispensed with the August l7, 2oo7 plea deadline specified in Menchel’s\nAugust 3, 2oo7 leter, in order to allou the defense to meet with him. After that meeting, and\nalthough Villafafia continued to plan to file charges on September 25, no new plea deadline was\nestablished, and the negotiations continued through most of September.\n\nThe defense used that time to push the USAO to make concessions. Because Acosta was\nnot willing to compromise on the issue of sexual offender registration or providing a means\nthrough which the victims could seek monetary damages, the negotiations focused on the term of\nimprisonment. As the contemporaneous emails shou, the USAO did not hold to its position that\na two-year term of imprisonment was “the minimum” that the USAO would accept. To reach an\nagreement with the defense on Epstein’s sentence, the USAO explored possible pleas in either\nfederal or state court, or both, and Villafafia spent considerable time and effort working with\ndefense counsel on developing alternative pleas with various outcomes. In the course of that\nprocess, the agreement was revised to require that Epstein accept a sentence of l8 months, with\nthe understanding that under the state’s sentencing procedures, he would likely serve just l5\nmonths.\n\nA. The Incarceration Term Is Reduced from 24 Months to 2o Months\n\nShortly after the September 7, 2oo7 meeting, Epstein atorney Gerald Lefcourt, who had\nnot been present at the meeting, spoke with both Acosta and Lourie, and made a new counteroffer,\nproposing that Epstein serve l5 months in jail folloued by l5 months in home confinement. On\nthe afternoon of Monday, September lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, identifying issues she\nwanted to discuss with him, including her concern that defense counsel was pushing for a\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> that would allou Epstein to avoid incarceration and possibly sexual offender\nregistration. Villafafia stated that Lefcourt’s counteroffer was “a reasonable counteroffer in light\nof our starting position of 24 months,” but added that it was “a really lou sentence.” Villafafia\nlo3 Sloman echoed this point, telling OPR that Starr’s presentation focused on the issue of federalism, but the\nUSAO had already decided to defer prosecution to the state and after the meeting, the USAO continued on that path.\n\n63\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4387", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004389.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 92 of 349\n\nVillafafia told OPR that during the meeting, the group discussed the draft NPA, but she did\nnot think they gave a copy to Krischer and Belohlavek. Neither Krischer nor Belohlavek expressed\nconcer about proceeding as the USAO was proposing. According to Villafafia, Belohlavek\nexplained that a plea to the three state counts identified in the draft NPA would affect the state’s\nsentencing guidelines, and that it would be beter for the guidelines calculation if Epstein pled\nguilty to just one of the three counts. Villafafia recalled that when Belohlavek confirmed that\nEpstein would be required to register as a sexual offender if he pled to any one of the three charges,\nLourie, speaking for the USAO, agreed to allou Epstein to enter his plea to just one state charge\nin addition to the pending state indictment, and the defense atorneys selected the charge of\nprocurement of minors to engage in prostitution.!°° Lourie, houever, disputed Villafafia’s\nrecollection that he made the final decision, stating that it was “illogical” to conclude that he had\nthe authority to change the terms of agreement unilaterally. !°”\n\nDuring the meeting, defense counsel raised concerns about Epstein serving time in state\nprison. Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie, the other supervisor, and she made clear during the\nmeeting that they expected Epstein to be incarcerated 24 hours a day, seven days a week, during\nthe entirety of his sentence, and they did not “particularly care” whether it was in a state or local\nfacility. Belohlavek explained to OPR that in order for Epstein to serve his time in a county\nfacility, rather than state prison, his sentence on each charge could be no more than l2 months, so\nthat, for example, consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months—totaling l8 months—could be\nserved in the county jail. Villafafia told OPR:\n\nOur thing was incarceration 24 hours a day. So during this meeting,\n\nI remember [the defense] talking about .. .a one year count folloued\n\nby a six-month count . . . that [Epstein] could serve them back to\n\nback but at the county jail, rather than having to go to a state facility.\n\nBut then I said, “But if you do that, it’s still going to have to be round\n\nthe clock incarceration.” And Barry Krischer said yes. And [he]\n\nsaid that to avoid [Epstein being extorted while incarcerated], he\n\nwould be kept in solitary confinement.\nVillafafia did not recall whether she and Lourie agreed to an l8-month sentence during that\nmeeting, but she told OPR that in her view, allouing Epstein to serve his sentence in the county\njail was not a “concession” because he would be incarcerated regardless.\n\nNeither Lourie nor the other USAO supervisor present could recall any substantive details\nof the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and Krischer and Belohlavek told OPR they did not remember\nthe meeting at all. Krischer did, houever, recall that he was “not offended at all” when he learned\nof the proposed federal <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, requiring Epstein to plead to both the pending state indictment\nand an additional charge requiring sexual offender registration, explaining to OPR that Epstein\n“was going to plead guilty to my indictment, we were going to add an additional charge, he was\nlo6 Later, the defense would claim that they had mistakenly understood that the selected charge would not\ninvolve sexual offender registration.\n\nlo7 As noted belou, a contemporaneous email indicates that shortly after the meeting, Lourie and Villafafia spoke\nwith Acosta and Sloman, who concurred with the agreement.\n65\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4389", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004390.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 93 of 349\ngoing to become a registered sex offender, and he was going to go actually do time—which he\nhadn’t done up to this point.” Krischer asked, “Why would I turn that doun?” Krischer also noted\nthat at that time, sexual offender registration “was not the norm” in Florida, and he recognized that\n“it was clearly something that was important to the U.S. Atorney’s Office.” !\n\nAcosta told OPR that he did not recall if he learned what transpired at the September l2\nmeeting, nor did he recall why the USAO team agreed to permit Epstein to plead guilty to only\none charge. Acosta told OPR, houever, that he recognized that Villafafia and Lourie needed “some\ndegree of discretion to negotiate”; that “in the give and take” of negotiations, they might propose\na concession; and he was comfortable with the concession as long as the charge to which Epstein\nultimately pled “captured the conduct” in an “appropriate” way.\n\nAlthough Epstein’s atorneys expressed interest in Epstein serving his time in a county\nfacility (rather than state prison), one of Epstein’s atorneys alternatively expressed interest in\nEpstein serving his time in a federal facility, and along with discussions about the possible state\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, the USAO and Epstein’s counsel also discussed a possible federal plea with a sentence\nrunning concurrently to the sentence Epstein would receive on the already indicted state charge.\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz an email advising that she and Lourie had talked with\nAcosta and Sloman, and they were “all satisfied in principle with the agreement.”!” The next day,\nSeptember l3, 2oo7, Villafafia sent an email to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and two other supervisors,\nidentifying potential federal offenses that would yield a two-year sentence. Villafafia also emailed\ndefense counsel, stating that she had been “spending some quality time with Title l8”—referring\nto the code of federal criminal statutes—to make sure there would be a “factual basis” for any\nfederal plea, and identifying the federal statutes she was considering.\n\nC. The Evidence Does Not Clearly Shou Why the Term of Incarceration Was\n\nReduced from 24 Months to 2o Months to l8 Months\n\nOPR reviewed the contemporaneous records and asked Acosta, Villafafia, and Lourie to\nexplain hou the jail term Epstein would have to accept came to be reduced from two years to l8\nmonths. Lourie had no recollection of the process through which the term of incarceration was\nreduced. Villafafia and Acosta offered significantly different explanations.\n\nVillafafia told OPR:\n\nWe had this flip flop between is it going to be a state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge, is it going to be [a] state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge? And to get to a federal charge, there\n\nwas no way to do 24 months that made any sense. So somehou it\n\nended up being 2o months and then it got to be l8 months. And\n\nthese were calls that if I remember correctly, Jay Lefkouitz was\nlo8 Belohlavek, houever, told OPR that sexual offender registration “was a common occurrence” for enumerated\nstate crimes, but the state crime charged in the state indictment against Epstein was not one of them.\nlo9 The email does not indicate what the parties meant by “the agreement.”\n\n66\nDOJ-OGR-oooo439o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004394.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 97 of 349\nevidence of a violation of the agreement. Epstein and his counsel\nagree that the computers that are currently under [legal process] will\nbe safeguarded in their current condition by Epstein’s counsel or\ntheir agents until the terms and conditions of the Agreement are\nfulfilled.\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a lengthy email to convey two options Lourie had\nsuggested: “the original proposal” for a state plea but with an agreement for an l8-month sentence,\nor pleas to state charges and two federal obstruction-of-justice charges. Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year conspiracy\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding recommendation for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\nsentenced in the state after he is sentenced in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be sentenced after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of all criminal liability, ‘and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she understood\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.!'?\n\nWith regard to immigration, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on immigration issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in connection with\ntheir immigration paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status. So there wasn’t any reason\nM3 OPR understood Villafafia’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry\ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to\ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4394", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004396.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 99 of 349\nwe go that route, would you intend to make the deferred [sic] prosecution agreement public?”\nVillafafia replied that while a federal plea agreement would be part of the court file and publicly\naccessible, the NPA “would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would remain part\nof our case file. It probably would be subject to a FOIA [Freedom of Information Act] request,\nbut it is not something that we would distribute without compulsory process.”!'!® Villafafia told\nOPR that she believed Epstein did not want the NPA to be made public because he “did not want\npeople to believe him to have commited a variety of crimes.” As she explained to OPR, Villafafia\nbelieved the NPA did not need to be disclosed in its entirety, but she anticipated notifying the\nvictims about the NPA provisions relating to their ability to recover damages.\nE. The Parties Appear to Reach Agreement on a Plea to Federal Charges\nNegotiations continued the next day, Tuesday, September l8, 2oo7. Responding to\n\nVillafafia’s revised draft of the NPA, Lefkouitz suggested that Epstein plead to one federal charge\nwith a l2-month sentence, folloued by one year of supervised release with a requirement for home\ndetention and two years of state probation, with the first six months of the state sentence to be\nserved under community control. Villafafia replied, “I knou that the U.S. Atorney will not go\nbelou l8 months of prison/jail time (and I would strongly oppose the suggestion).” Shortly\nthereafter, Villafafia emailed Acosta, Lourie, and the incoming West Palm Beach manager:\n\nHi all — I think that we may be near the end of our negotiations with\n\nMr. Epstein, and not because we have reached a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. As I\n\nmentioned yesterday, I spent about l2 hours over the weekend\n\ndrafting Informations, changing plea agreements, and writing\n\nfactual proffers. I was supposed to receive a draft agreement from\n\nthem yesterday, which never arrived. At that time, they were\n\nleaning touards pleading only to state charges and doing all of the\n\ntime in state custody.\n\nLate last night I talked to Jay Lefkouitz who asked about Epstein\n\npleading to two twelve-month federal charges with half of his jail\n\ntime being spent in home confinement pursuant to the guidelines. I\n\ntold him that I had no objection to that approach but, in the interest\n\nof full disclosure, I did not believe that Mr. Epstein would be eligible\n\nbecause he will not be in Zone A or B.'!’ This morning Jay\n\nLefkouitz called and said that I was correct but, if we could get\n\nMr. Epstein doun to l4 months, then he thought he would be\n\neligible.\n\nMy response: have him plead to two separate Informations. On the\n\nfirst one he gets l2 months’ imprisonment and on the second he gets\nlG FOIA requires disclosure of government records upon request unless an exemption applies permiting the\ngovernment to withhold the requested records.

The Defense Rejects the Federal Plea Agreement, Returns to the NPA\n“State-Only” <span class=\"highlight\">Resolution</span>, and Begins Opposing the Sexual Offender\nRegistration Requirement\n\nAfter having spent days negotiating the federal charges to be included in a plea agreement,\nby the afternoon of September 2o, 2oo7, the defense rejected the federal plea option, and the parties\nresumed negotiations over the details of an NPA calling for Epstein to plead to only state charges.\nThrough multiple emails and atempts (some successful) to speak directly with Acosta and other\nsupervisors, defense atorneys vigorously fought the USAO’s insistence that Epstein plead to a\nstate charge requiring sexual offender registration.\n\nAfter receiving the federal plea agreement, Lefkouitz spoke with Villafafia. She reported\nto Acosta and Lourie that Lefkouitz told her the defense was “‘back to doing the state-charges-\nonly agreement” and wanted until the middle of the follouing week to work out the details, but\nthat she had told defense counsel that “we need a signed agreement by tomorrou [Friday] or we\nare [filing charges] on Tuesday.”\n\nLefkouitz emailed Villafafia about the draft NPA that she had sent to him, pointing out\nthat it called for a 2o-month jail sentence folloued by lo months of community control, rather than\nl8 months in jail and l2 under community control, and to ask if the USAO had “any flexibility”\non the § 2255 procedure. Villafafia responded:\n\nThe l8 and l2 has already been agreed to by our office, so that is\nnot a problem. On the issue about l8 [U.S.C. §] 2255, we seem to\nbe miles apart. Your most recent version not only had me binding\nthe girls to a trust fund administered by the state court, but also\npromising that they will give up their [§] 2255 rights.\n\nI reviewed the e-mail that I sent you on Sunday with the comments\non some of your other changes. In the context of a non-prosecution\nagreement, the office may be more willing to be specific about not\npursuing charges against others. Houever, as I stated on Sunday,\nthe Office cannot and will not bind Immigration.\n\nAlso, your timetable will need to move up significantly. As [State\nAtorney] Barry [Krischer] said in our meeting last week, his office\ncan put together a plea agreement, [and an] information, and get you\nall before the [state] judge on a change of plea within a day.\n\nVillafafia alerted Krischer that evening that negotiations were “not going very well” and\nthat defense counsel “changed their minds again, and they only want to plead to state charges, not\nconcurrent state and federal.” She added, “If we cannot reach .. . an agreement, then I need to\n[charge] the case on Tuesday [September 25] and I will not budge from that date.”\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s report of her conversation with Lefkouitz about the defense\npreference for a “state-charges-only agreement,” Lourie alerted her that, “He wants to get out of\n[sexual offender] registration which we should not agree to.” Lourie emailed Acosta:\n\n78\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004403.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lo6 of 349\n\nI think Jay [Lefkouitz] will try to talk you out of a registrable\noffense. Regardless of the merits of his argument, in order to get us\ndoun in time they made us an offer that included pleading to an\noffense against a minor (encouraging a minor into prostitution) and\ntouted that we should be happy because it was registrable. For that\nreason alone, I don’t think we should consider allouing them to\ncome doun from their oun offer, either on this issue or on time of\nincarceration.\n\nLefkouitz atempted to reach Acosta that night, but Acosta directed Villafafia to return the\ncall, and told Lourie that he did not want to open ‘“‘a backchannel” with defense counsel. Lourie\ninstructed Villafafia, “U can tell [JJay that [A]lex will not agree to a nonregistration offense.”\n\nOn the morning of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Acosta informing him\nthat “it looks like we will be [filing charges against] Mr. Epstein on Tuesday,” reporting that the\ncharging package was being reviewed by the West Palm Beach manager, and asking if anyone in\nthe Miami office needed to review it. Villafafia also alerted Lourie that she had spoken that\nmorning to Lefkouitz, who “was waffling” about Epstein pleading to a state charge that required\nsexual offender registration, and she noted that she would confer with Krischer and Belohlavek\n“to make sure the defense doesn’t try to do an end run.”\n\nThat same morning, Epstein atorney Sanchez, who had not been involved in negotiations\nfor several weeks, emailed Sloman, advising, “[I] want to finalize the plea deal and there is only\none issue outstanding and [I] do not believe that [A]lex has read all the defense submissions that\nwould assist in his determination on this point . . . [U]pon <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, we will be prepared to sign\nas soon as today.” From his out-of-toun vacation, Sloman forwarded the email to Acosta, who\nreplied, “Enjo[y] vacation. Working with [M]arie on this.” Sloman also forwarded Sanchez’s\nemail to Lourie and asked, “Do you knou what she’s talking about?” Lourie responded that\nSanchez “has not been in any negotiations. Don’t even engage with yet another cook.”\n\nJ. The USAO Agrees Not to Criminally Charge “Potential Co-Conspirators”\n\nLefkouitz, in the meantime, sent Villafafia a revised draft NPA that proposed an l8-month\nsentence in the county jail, folloued by l2 months of community control, and restored the\nprovision for a trust fund for disbursement to an agreed-upon list of individuals “who seek\nreimbursement by filing suit pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 2255.” This defense draft retained the\nprovision promising not to criminally charge Epstein’s four female assistants and unnamed\nemployees of the specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity, but also extended the provision to “any\npotential co-conspirators” for any criminal charge arising from the ongoing federal investigation.\nThis language had evolved from similar language that Villafafia had included in the USAO’s\nearlier proposed draft federal plea agreement.!?? Lefkouitz also again included the sentence\nl22 The language in the USAO’s draft federal plea agreement stated, “This agreement resolves the federal\ncriminal liability of the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any\ncriminal conduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO]... .”\n\n79\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004405.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lo8 of 349\nfederal court. Sloman similarly said that he had the impression that the non-prosecution provision\nwas meant to protect named co-conspirators who were also victims, “in a sense,” of Epstein’s\nconduct. Although later press coverage of the Epstein case focused on Epstein’s connection to\nprominent figures and suggested that the non-prosecution provision protected these individuals,\nSloman told OPR that it never occurred to him that the reference to potential co-conspirators was\ndirected touard any of the high-profile individuals who were at the time or subsequently linked\nwith Epstein.'”° Acosta did not recall the provision or any discussions about it. He speculated\nthat if he read the non-prosecution provision, he likely assumed that Villafafia and Lourie had\n“thought this through” and “addressed it for a reason.” The West Palm Beach manager, who had\nonly limited involvement at this stage, told OPR that the provision was “highly unusual,” and he\nhad “‘no clue” why the USAO agreed to it.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had\nnot developed evidence of “any other potential co-conspirators. So, . . . we wouldn’t be\nprosecuting anybody else, so why not include it? ... I just didn’t think that there was anybody\nthat it would cover.” She conceded, houever, that she “did not catch the fact that it could be read\nas broadly as people have since read it.”\n\nK. The USAO Rejects Defense Efforts to Eliminate the Sexual Offender\n\nRegistration Requirement\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, State Atorney Krischer informed\nVillafafia that Epstein’s counsel had contacted him and Epstein was ready to agree “to all the\nterms” of the NPA—except for sexual offender registration. According to Krischer, defense\ncounsel had proposed that registration be deferred, and that Epstein register only if state or federal\nlaw enforcement felt, at any point during his service of the sentence, that he needed to do so.\nKrischer noted that he had “reached out” to Acosta about this proposal but had not heard back\nfrom him. Villafafia responded, “T think Alex is calling you nou.” Villafafia told OPR that, to her\nknouledge, Acosta called Krischer to tell him that registration was not a negotiable term. !*°\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia emailed Krischer for information about the amount of “gain\ntime” Epstein would earn in state prison. Villafafia explained in her email that she wanted to\ninclude a provision in the NPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at least a certain\nnumber of days to make sure he doesn’t try to ‘convince’ someone with the Florida prison\nauthorities to let him out early.” Krischer responded that under the proposal as it then stood,\nEpstein would serve l5 months. He also told Villafafia that a plea to a registrable offense would\nnot prevent Epstein from serving his time “at the stockade”—the local minimum security detention\nfacility. l?’\n\nl25 Sloman also pointed out that the NPA was not a “global <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>” and other co-conspirators could have\nbeen prosecuted “by any other [U.S. Atorney’s] office in the country.”\n\nl26 Krischer told OPR that he did not recall meeting or having interactions with Acosta regarding the Epstein\ncase or any other mater.\n\nal The State Atorney concluded his email: “Glad we could get this worked out for reasons I won’t put in\nwriting. After this is resolved I would love to buy you a cup at Starbucks and have a conversation.” Villafafia\nresponded, “Sounds great.” When asked about this exchange during her OPR interview, Villafafia said: “Everybody\n\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004406.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lo9 of 349\n\nAt some point that day, Acosta spoke with Lefkouitz by phone regarding the need for\nEpstein to plead to a registrable offense. Throughout the weekend, with Villafafia’s Monday\ndeadline looming, defense counsel pressed hard to eliminate the sexual offender requirement. On\nSaturday, September 22, 2oo7, Sanchez sent a series of emails to Lourie. In the first, she provided\ndetails from a press report about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty to\nchild sex abuse charges and was sentenced to a term of probation. She noted that she “spoke to\n[M]at [Menchel]” and asked Lourie to call her. Two hours later she sent Lourie a second, lengthy\nemail, strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against\nregistration [as a sexual offender] in this case.” In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been\na “miscommunication” during the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and that “we only agreed to the\nsolicitation with minors because we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was\nNOT registrable.” Sanchez complained that lifetime sexual offender registration was a “life\nsentence” that was “uncalled for,” “does not make sense,” and was “inappropriate” to impose\n“simply [because] the FBI wants it, in return for all there [sic] efforts.” She listed numerous\nreasons why Epstein should not have to register, including his lack of a prior record or history of\nsexual offenses; the lack of any danger of recidivism; the ease with which he could be “tracked”\nwithout registering; and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state\nregistration requirements. A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number to Lourie\n“in case you want to speak to him directly.”\n\nIn another email sent less than two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing again\nbecause “you are a very fair person. This <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> in the Epstein case is not reasonable. [I]t isa\nresult of a misunderstanding at a meeting.” She stated that Epstein’s atorneys had “consistently\nemphasized their goal of l8 months in a federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable\noffense precluded” a camp designation. Sanchez added, “Therefore it would have been wholly\ninconsistent with that primary goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration at that\nmeeting.” Sanchez concluded, “[I]mposing a life sentence on him is not something anyone will\neventually be proud of. Please reconsider and help me get a fair result.”\n\nLourie responded to none of the Sanchez emails, but he did reach out to Acosta for a phone\nconversation. By email late that night, at lo:26 p.m., Lefkouitz asked Lourie to phone him.\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia—\nto “follou up on our conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement that\nEpstein plead to a registrable offense. Lefkouitz wrote that there had been a “misunderstanding”\nat the September l2, 2oo7 meeting:\n\nBefore the meeting, Mr. Krischer and Ms. Belohlavek, a sex\n\nprosecutor for l3 years, told us that solicitation of a minor . . . is not\n\na registerable offense. Houever, as it turned out, [it] is a registerable\n\noffense and our discussion at the meeting was based on a mistaken\n\nassumption. We suggest that Mr. Epstein enter two pleas—one to\n\nthe Indictment and a second to a non-registerable charge.\nhas offered to buy me a cup of coffee. I have had coffee with no one.” Krischer told OPR that the “reasons” to which\nhe referred related to the pressure he had been geting from Chief Reiter about the Epstein case.\n\n82\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004408.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll of 349\nThe parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part of\nany public record.

SEPTEMBER 24, 2oo7: ACOSTA MAKES FINAL EDITS, AND THE NPA IS\n\nSIGNED\n\nThe contemporaneous emails shou that Villafafia continued to update Acosta as the parties\nnegotiated the final language and that Acosta reviewed and edited the NPA. Shortly after midnight\non Monday, September 24, 2oo7, Acosta sent Villafafia “[s]mall edits” to the “final” NPA she had\nsent to him. Among his changes was language modifying provisions that appeared to require the\nState Atorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein\nenter his guilty plea by a certain date. Acosta explained in his email, “I’m not comfortable with\nrequiring the State Atorney to enter into a [joint sentencing] recommendation” or “requiring a\nState court to stick with our timeline” for entry of the guilty plea and sentencing. Accordingly,\nAcosta substituted language that required Epstein alone to make a binding sentencing\nrecommendation to the state court, and required Epstein to use his “best efforts” to enter his guilty\nplea and be sentenced by the specified dates. Acosta also instructed Villafafia to restore a reference\nto Epstein’s wish “to reach a global <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of his state and federal criminal liabilities.” Lourie,\nwho had returned to the Department in Washington, D.C., had a phone conversation with\nLefkouitz and sent additional comments on the final draft to Acosta and Villafafia. Villafafia sent\na new revision, incorporating edits from Acosta and Lourie, to Lefkouitz later that morning.\n\nOn the afternoon of September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia circulated the new “final” version of\nthe NPA to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other supervisors, and asked Lefkouitz to send her the\nsigned agreement. After Lefkouitz electronically transmited to Villafafia a copy of the NPA\nsigned by Epstein, she emailed her immediate supervisor and her co-counsel: “They have scanned\nand emailed the signed agreement. It is done.”\n\nIn his transmital email, Lefkouitz asked Villafafia to “[p]lease do whatever you can to\nkeep this from becoming public.” Villafafia responded:\n\nI have forwarded your message only to Alex, Andy, and [the West\n\nPalm Beach manager]. I don’t anticipate it going any further than\n\nthat. When I receive the originals, I will sign and return one copy\n\nto you. The other will be placed in the case file, which will be kept\n\nconfidential since it also contains identifying information about the\n\ngirls.\n\nWhen we reach an agreement about the atorney representative for\n\nthe girls, we can discuss what I can tell him and the girls about the\nl28 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Lourie observed that because the NPA contained names of uncharged\nco-conspirators and other protected information, the USAO would have a duty to redact the information before\ndisclosing the NPA.\n\n84\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004409.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll2 of 349\nagreement. I knou that Andy promised Chief Reiter an update when\na <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> was achieved. ... [The West Palm Beach manager] is\ncalling, but [he] knous not to tell Chief Reiter about the money\nissue, just about what crimes Mr. Epstein is pleading guilty to and\nthe amount of time that has been agreed to. [He] also is telling Chief\nReiter not to disclose the outcome to anyone.\n\nOPR questioned Villafafia about this email. She explained that she generally kept\nconfidential the terms of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of any case. She understood that “the way that the [Epstein]\ncase was resolved” needed to remain confidential, but the victims could be informed about what\nhappened because by the NPA’s terms, they needed to knou what the agreement was about.\n\nVillafafia emailed the West Palm Beach manager, asking him to tell PBPD Chief Reiter\n“the good news” but “leave out the part about damages,” and explained that she wanted to meet\nwith the victims herself to explain hou the damages provision would work. Villafafia also told\nhim that Lourie had asked that Reiter share information about the NPA only with the PBPD\nDetective who had led the state investigation of Epstein.'”’ Villafafia forwarded to Acosta, Lourie,\nand the West Palm Beach manager Lefkouitz’s email asking that the USAO try to keep the NPA\nfrom becoming public. Acosta responded that the agreement “already binds us not to make public\nexcept as required by law under [the Freedom of Information Act],” and asked, “[W]hat more does\nhe want?” Villafafia replied, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief or FBI\nor the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.” Soon thereafter, Acosta emailed Lourie, Villafafia,\nand the West Palm Beach manager to set up a call to discuss “who we tell and hou much,” adding,\n“Nice job with a difficult negotiation.”\n\nThe final NPA, as signed by Epstein, his atorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez, and Villafafia,\ncontained the follouing pertinent provisions:\n\nCharges: Epstein would plead guilty to the pending Palm Beach County indictment,\n\nplus one count of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution, a\nregistrable offense.\n\nSentence: The parties would make a joint, binding recommendation for a 3o-month\nsentence divided as follous: consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months\nin the county jail, without opportunity for withholding adjudication or\nsentencing and without community control or probation, folloued by\nl2 months of community control, consecutive. !°°\n\nDamages: As long as the identified victims proceeded exclusively under l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255, Epstein would not contest federal court jurisdiction or the victims’\nstatus as victims.

More importantly, Lefkouitz used the\ndiscussion of the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the\nNPA or, at least, to its interpretation. Focusing on the atorney representative, Lefkouitz argued\nthat the atorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating setlements and that the atorney\nwas precluded from filing lawsuits on behalf of victims who could not reach a negotiated\nsetlement with Epstein. Lefkouitz proposed:\n\n[T]he selected atorney should evaluate the claims of each identified\n\nindividual, negotiate a total fund amount with Mr. Epstein, then\n\ndistribute the monies based on the strength of each case. For those\n\nidentified individuals who elect not to setle with Mr. Epstein, they\n\nmay proceed on their oun, but by doing so, they would not be suing\n\nunder § 2255 as contemplated by [the NPA] and therefore may not\n\ncontinue to be represented by the selected atorney.\nLefkouitz also objected to Villafafia’s draft leter to the special master, asserting that it was\nessential for the defense to participate in crafting a “mutually acceptable communication” to the\nvictims. Going further, Lefkouitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims\nabout the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision. Lefkouitz\nadmonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the\ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected atorney and the setlement process.”\n\nVillafafia forwarded Lefkouitz’s leter to Sloman, complaining that the defense\ninterpretation of the § 2255 procedure violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I\nplease just indict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follou-up\nleter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the atorney representative’s role, and\narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’\ncivil lawsuits in the event a setlement could not be reached. When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez]. The more ‘voices’ they hear the more wedges they try to drive\nbetween us.” Villafafia agreed, noting that “[t]here are so many of them over there, I am afraid we\nare geting triple-teamed.”!*°\n\nVillafafia sent Sanchez a leter regarding the roles of the special master and atorney\nrepresentative. The next day, October lo, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent a six-page leter to Acosta, as a\n“follou up to our conversation yesterday,” expressing “serious disagreements” with Villafafia’s\nview of the process for victims to claim § 2255 damages under the NPA. Lefkouitz reiterated the\ndefense position that the atorney representative’s role was meant to be limited to negotiating\nsetlements for the victims, rather than pursuing litigation. Lefkouitz claimed that a requirement\nl36 Villafafia also alerted Sloman that a newspaper was reporting that defense counsel was writing a leter to\nAcosta asking for reconsideration of the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.

In addition, Lefkouitz rejected Villafafia’s view that Epstein\nhad waived the right to challenge § 2255 liability as to victims who did not want to setle their\nclaims, and contended that any such victims “will have to prove, among other things, that they are\nvictims under the enumerated statutes.” Finally, Lefkouitz again argued that the USAO should\nnot discuss the setlement process with the victims who were to be identified as eligible for\nsetlement under § 2255:\n\nMs. Villafafia proposes that either she or federal agents will speak\nwith the [victims] regarding the setlement process. We do not think\nit is the government’s place to be co-counsel to the [victims], nor\nshould the FBI be their personal investigators. Neither federal\nagents nor anyone from your Office should contact the [victims] to\ninform them of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the case, including appointment of\nthe atorney representative and the setlement process. Not only\nwould that violate the confidentiality of the Agreement, but\nMr. Epstein also will have no control over what is communicated to\nthe [victims] at this most critical stage. We believe it is essential\nthat we participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication\nto the [victims]. We further believe that communications between\nyour Office or your case agents and the [victims] might well violate\nRule 6(e)(2)(B) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

In his leter, Starr\nargued that the USAO improperly had compelled Epstein to agree to pay civil damages under\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 as part of a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of a criminal case. On the same day, Lefkouitz\nemailed Sloman, complaining about the USAO’s plan to notify victims about the § 2255 provision\nand alerting Sloman that Epstein’s counsel were seeking a meeting with the Assistant Atorney\nGeneral “to address what we believe is the unprecedented nature of the section 2255 component”\nof the NPA. After Lourie sent to Sloman a copy of the Starr leter, Sloman forwarded it to\nVillafafia, asking her to prepare a chronology of the plea negotiations and hou the § 2255 provision\nevolved. Villafafia responded that she was “going through all of the ways in which they have tried\nto breach the agreement to convince you guys to let me indict.”\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Lourie consulted with CEOS Chief Oosterban, asking for his\nthoughts on defense counsel’s arguments. At the same time, at Lourie’s request, Villafafia sent\nthe NPA and its addendum to Lourie and Oosterban. Oosterban responded to Lourie that he was\n“not thrilled” about the NPA; described Epstein’s conduct as unusually “egregious,” particularly\nbecause of its serial nature; and observed that the NPA was “prety advantageous for the defendant\nand not all that helpful to the victims.” He opined, houever, that the Assistant Atorney General\nwould not and should not consider or address the NPA “other than to say that she agrees with it.”\nDuring her OPR interview, Fisher did not recall reading Starr’s leter or discussing it with\nOosterban, but believed the comment about her “agree[ing] with it” referred to a federal\nprosecution of Epstein, which she believed was appropriate. She told OPR, houever, that she\n“played no role in” the NPA and did not review or approve the agreement either before or after it\nwas signed.\n\nAs set forth in more detail in Chapter Three of this Report, Villafafia planned to notify the\nvictims about the NPA and its § 2255 provision, as well as about the state plea hearing, and she\nprovided a draft of the notification leter to Lefkouitz for comments. On November 29, 2oo7,\nLefkouitz sent Acosta a leter complaining about the draft notification to the victims. Lefkouitz\nasked the USAO to refrain from notifying the victims until after defense counsel met with Assistant\nAtorney General Fisher, which he anticipated would take place the follouing week. Internal\nemails indicate that Lourie contacted Oosterban about his availability for a meeting with Starr,\nbut both Fisher and Lourie told OPR that such a meeting never took place, and OPR found no\nevidence that it did.\n\nAcosta promptly responded to Lefkouitz by leter, directing him to raise his concerns about\nvictim notification with Villafafia or Sloman. Acosta also addressed Epstein’s evident efforts to\nstop the NPA from being enforced:\n\nl52 In a short email to Fisher, the next day, Lourie reported simply: “He was very nice.

Under this\nAgreement, this District has agreed to defer prosecution for\nenumerated sections of Title l8 in favor of prosecution by the State\nof Florida, provided .. . Mr. Epstein satisfies three general federal\ninterests: (l) that Mr. Epstein plead guilty to a “registerable”\noffense; (2) that this plea include a binding recommendation for a\nsufficient term of imprisonment; and (3) that the Agreement not\nharm the interests of his victims.\n\nAcosta explained in the leter that the USAO’s intent was “‘to place the identified victims\nin the same position as they would have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial.

Acosta’s leter concluded:\n\nAlthough it happens rarely, I do not mind this Office’s decision\nbeing appealed to Washington, and have previously directed our\nprosecutors to delay filings in this case to provide defense counsel\nwith the option of appealing our decisions. Indeed, although I am\nconfident in our prosecutors’ evidence and legal analysis, I\nnonetheless directed them to consult with the subject mater experts\nin [CEOS] to confirm our interpretation of the law before approving\ntheir [charges]. I am thus surprised to read a leter addressed to\nDepartment Headquarters that raises issues that either have not been\nraised with this Office previously or that have been raised, and in\nfact resolved, in your client’s favor.\n\nI am troubled, likewise, by the apparent lack of finality in this\nAgreement. The AUSAs who have been negotiating with defense\ncounsel have for some time complained to me regarding the tactics\nused by the defense team. It appears to them that as soon as\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> is reached on one issue, defense counsel finds ways to\nchallenge the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> collaterally. My response thus far has been\nthat defense counsel is doing its job to vigorously represent the\nclient. That said, there must be closure on this mater. Some in our\nOffice are deeply concerned that defense counsel will continue to\nmount collateral challenges to provisions of the Agreement, even\nafter Mr. Epstein has entered his guilty plea and thus rendered the\nagreement difficult, if not impossible, to unwind.\n\nI would reiterate that it is not the intention of this Office ever to force\nthe hand of a defendant to enter into an agreement against his\nwishes. Your client has the right to proceed to trial. Although time\nis of the essence . . . I am directing our prosecutors not to issue\nvictim notification leters until this Friday . . . to provide you with\ntime to review these options with your client... . We expect a\nwriten decision by [December 7, 2oo7] at 5 p.m., indicating\nwhether the defense team wishes to reaffirm, or to unwind, the\nAgreement.\n\nAcosta explained to OPR that he did not view his leter as “inviting” Departmental review,\nbut he believed the Department had the “right” to address Epstein’s concerns. Moreover, the\nUSAO’s only option at that time was to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA, which would have\nprompted litigation as to whether Epstein was, in fact, in breach. Acosta noted that defense counsel\nrepeatedly proclaimed Epstein’s intent to abide by the agreement, making any USAO effort to\ndeclare him in breach more difficult. In fact, the day after receiving Acosta’s leter, Starr and\nLefkouitz responded to Acosta (with copies to Sloman and Assitant Atorney General Fisher) that\n\n97\nDOJ-OGR-oooo442l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004424.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l27 of 349\n4.

He sent to Deputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal Mandelker language that he\nproposed including in a revision to the NPA’s § 2255 implementation section. Mandelker\nforwarded the language to her counterpart in the Civil Division, who responded to Mandelker and\nAcosta that he did not have “any insight” to offer. On December l9, 2oo7, after Acosta and\nSloman had a phone conversation with Starr and Lefkouitz, Acosta sent to Sanchez a leter\nproposing to resolve “our disagreements over interpretation[]” by replacing the existing language\nof the NPA relating to § 2255 with a provision that would read:\nAny person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an\noffense enumerated in Title l8, United States Code, Section 2255,\nwill have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she\nwould have had, if Mr. Epstein [had] been tried federally and\nconvicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing\nthis paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s\natorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to\nname... as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any\njudicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority\ndetermining which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet,\nshall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these\nidentified victims in the same position as they would have been had\nMr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.\n\nAcosta also noted that he had resisted his prosecutors’ urging to declare the NPA breached by the\n\ndefense delays. !°’\n\nLefkouitz responded by leter a few days later, suggesting that Acosta’s proposal raised\n“several troubling questions” and that “the problem arises from the incongruity that exists when\natempting to fit a federal civil remedies statute into a criminal plea agreement.” !** Ina follou-up\nleter to Acosta, to address the USAO’s concern that Epstein was intentionally delaying the entry\nof his guilty plea, Lefkouitz asserted that “any impediment to the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> at issue is a direct\ncause of the disagreements between the parties,” and that defense counsel had “at all times made\nand will continue to make sincere efforts to resolve and finalize issues as expeditiously as\npossible.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that despite this assurance from defense counsel, he was “increasingly\nfrustrated” by Epstein’s desire to take an “llth hour appeal” to the Department so soon before the\nl57 As described in detail in Chapter Three, Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter also addressed defense objections\nto notifying the victims about the NPA and the state plea.\n\nl58 After Starr and Lefkouitz had another conversation with Acosta and Sloman, Lefkouitz sent a second leter\nto Acosta reiterating concerns with the § 2255 provision and asserting that the provision was “inherently flawed and\nbecoming truly unmanageable.” In the end, the defense team rejected Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 NPA modification\nleter.\nloo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4424", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004425.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l28 of 349\nscheduled January 4, 2oo8 plea hearing. As soon became apparent, Acosta was unable to achieve\nan expedited review so that Epstein could plead guilty and be sentenced by\nJanuary 4, 2oo8, and the plea and sentencing date was rescheduled. On January 2, 2oo8, Sloman\nspoke with Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek, who confirmed that the change of plea hearing\nhad been postponed. In an email reporting this to Acosta and Villafafia, Sloman said that Epstein’s\nlocal defense atorney Goldberger had told Belohlavek the postponement was because the facts\n“did not fit the proposed state charge,” and that Belohlavek told Sloman she agreed with that\nassessment.’ The next day, Villafafia sent to Acosta and Sloman a local newspaper article\nreporting that Epstein’s state plea hearing was reset for March and in exchange for it the federal\nauthorities would drop their investigation of him. Acosta also sent to Sloman and Villafafia an\nemail memorializing a statement made to him by Lefkouitz in a phone call that day: “‘I\n[Lefkouitz] may have made a mistake 6 months ago. [Belohlavek] told us solicitation [is] not\nregistrable. It turns out that the actual offense charged is.’”!°°\n\n5. January 7, 2oo8: Acosta and Sloman Meet with Sanchez, Who Makes\nAdditional Allegations of USAO Misconduct\n\nOn January 7, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman met with defense atorney Sanchez at her request.\nAccording to meeting notes made by Sloman, among other things, Sanchez alleged that the\nUSAO’s media spokesperson had improperly disclosed details of the Epstein case to a national\nnews reporter, and Sanchez “suggested that the USAO could avoid any potential ugliness in DC\nby agreeing to a watered-doun <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> for Epstein.” After Acosta excused himself to atend\nanother meeting and Sloman refused to speak further with Sanchez “without a witness present,”\nshe left. Later that day, Acosta and Sloman spoke by phone with Starr, Lefkouitz, and Sanchez,\nwho expressed concern about the “leak” to the news media, reiterated their objections to the NPA,\nand pressed for the ‘“‘watered-doun <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>,” which they specified would mean allouing Epstein\nto plead to a charge of coercion instead of procurement, avoid serving time in jail, and not register\nas a sexual offender. A note in the margin of Sloman’s handwriten notes of the conversation\nreads: “We’re back to where we started in September.”\n\nThat evening, Villafafia expressed concern that the delay in resolving the mater was\naffecting the USAO’s ability to go forward with a prosecution should Epstein renege on his\nagreement, and she outlined for Acosta and Sloman the steps she proposed to take while Epstein\nwas pursuing Departmental review. Those steps included re-establishing contact with victims,\ninterviewing victims in New York and one victim who lived in a foreign country, making contact\nwith “potential sources of information” in the Virgin Islands, and re-initiating proceedings to\nobtain Epstein’s computers.\n\nIn the meantime, USAO Criminal Division Chief Robert Senior performed a “soup to nuts”\nreview of the Epstein investigation, reviewing the indictment package and all of the evidence\nVillafafia had compiled. He told OPR that he could not recall the reason for his review, but opined\nl5? Belohlavek told OPR that she did not recall this incident, but she noted that the PBPD report did set forth\nfacts supporting the charge of procurement of a minor.\n\nl6o Although the meeting Lefkouitz had with Lourie, Villafafia, Krischer, and Belohlavek to discuss the state\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> was only four months prior, not six, Lefkouitz’s reference was likely to the September l2, 2oo7 meeting.\nlol\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4425", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004433.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l36 of 349\nDivision forwarded to Roth the prior defense submissions, describing them as “an enormous\namount of material” regarding the Epstein mater. On June 3, 2oo8, Sloman sent to Roth a lengthy\nleter from Sloman to the Deputy Atorney General, recounting in detail the history of negotiations\nwith Epstein’s counsel culminating in the NPA, and addressing Epstein’s claims of professional\nmisconduct. Among the documents submited with the leter were the prosecution memorandum,\none of the proposed charging documents, and the NPA with its addendum and Acosta’s\nDecember l9, 2oo7 leter to Sanchez.\n\nAs the review was ongoing in the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, State Atorney\nKrischer mentioned to the USAO’s West Palm Beach manager that Krischer and Epstein’s local\ndefense atorney Jack Goldberger had arrived at a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of Epstein’s case that would involve\na 9o-day jail term, but Krischer provided no further information. Upon learning of this, Villafafia\nwrote to her immediate supervisor: “Please tell me that you are joking. Maybe we should throu\nhim [Epstein] a party and tell him we are sorry to have bothered him.” Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor later had phone and email exchanges with Krischer and with Epstein’s local counsel to\ninsist that the state plea comply with the terms of the NPA, or “we will consider it a breach of the\nagreement and proceed accordingly.” !7!\n\nDeputy Atorney General Filip told OPR he had never heard of Epstein before receiving\nStarr’s leter. Follouing the office’s standard protocol, Starr’s leter was handled by John Roth,\nan experienced senior federal prosecutor who had served some years before as an AUSA in the\nUSAO. Roth also told OPR that he had never before heard of Epstein. Roth explained to OPR\nthat he did not conduct an independent investigation, interview witnesses, or meet with Epstein’s\ncounsel, and instead limited his review to writen materials submited by Epstein’s atorneys and\nby Sloman to the Deputy Atorney General’s office, as well as materials that the defense team and\nthe USAO had previously provided to CEOS and the Criminal Division front office, and that\nCEOS furnished to him. Roth discussed the mater with two senior staff colleagues, as well as\nwith the Deputy Atorney General, who also reviewed the submissions.\n\nRoth told OPR that it was his understanding that Epstein had reneged on the NPA, and\nbecause he believed the NPA was a “dead leter,” he did not review the terms of the agreement or\nratify it post hoc. On the other hand, Deputy Atorney General Filip told OPR he understood that\nthe NPA was still in effect and that Epstein was trying to undermine the federal jurisdictional basis\nfor the agreement. Apart from addressing Epstein’s federalism arguments, houever, Deputy\nAtorney General Filip did not believe it was the “mission” of the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral to review the Epstein case de novo or to examine the NPA’s terms or determine whether\nthe NPA reached the “right balance” between state and federal punishment. He told OPR, “[W]e\nheard an appeal. . . . [Epstein] wanted a meeting to argue for relief. We didn’t give him a meeting\nand we didn’t give him [any] relief.” Deputy Atorney General Filip told OPR that no one in his\noffice who looked at Epstein’s arguments “felt that it was a sympathetic appeal.” In particular, he\ntold OPR that defense counsel’s argument that there was no basis for a federal prosecution was\n“ludicrous,” and the assertion that the USAO’s investigation of Epstein was politically motivated\n“Just seemed unserious.”\n\nM7l Villafafia urged Sloman, “Someone really needs to talk to Barry.”\nlo9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4433", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004434.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l37 of 349\n\nOn Monday, June 23, 2oo8, Roth sent a brief leter to Starr and Lefkouitz informing them\nthat the office had “completed a thorough review” of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater\nand did not believe intervention by the Deputy Atorney General was warranted in view of the\n“considerable discretion” vested by the Department in U.S. Atorneys. He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being sentenced, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence. On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls. Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try\nto take a further appeal in order to delay <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknouledging they had reached “the\nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While Iam obviously very unhappy at what I believe\nis the government’s treatment of my client, aman whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize\nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost. ... I would like to have .. . some\nclosure with you on this mater so that in the years to come, neither of us will harbor any ill will\nover the mater.”\n\nX. JUNE 2oo8 — JUNE 2oo9: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS PLEAS AND SERVES HIS\n\nCUSTODIAL SENTENCE\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia renewed her requests to Epstein’s local atorneys\nGoldberger and Black for a copy of the state plea agreement reached with the State Atorney’s\nOffice, noting that their failure to provide it was a material breach of the NPA. After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.’”!””\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\n\nV2 The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the\nchoice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as\nincompetence, corruption, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may\nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a conviction, if the prior\nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a\nsubstantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and restitution as well as\nimprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal\nprosecution.”\n\n(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal\noffense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and\nsustain a conviction.\n\nHouever, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a\nfederal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed\nprosecution.\n\nThe Petite policy cautions that whenever a mater involves overlapping federal and state\njurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most\nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests\ninvolved.” If a substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular\nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the mater to the appropriate Assistant Atorney General\nfor <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. Prior approval from the appropriate Assistant Atorney General must be obtained\nbefore bringing a prosecution governed by this policy.\n\n3. USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve an investigation or pending case through a\nplea agreement. USAM §§ 9-27.33o; 9-27.4oo. Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned\nby Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).!°3 Regardless of whether the plea agreement is\noffered pre-charge or post-charge, the prosecutor’s plea bargaining “must honestly reflect the\ntotality and seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.” USAM § 9-27.4oo, comment.!°4 The\nimportance of selecting a charge that reflects the seriousness of the conduct is echoed in USAM\n§ 9-27.43o, which directs the prosecutor to require a defendant to plead to an offense that\nrepresents the most serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the\nl28 As previously noted, Rule ll(c)(l)(C) permits the parties to agree to resolve the case in exchange for a\nspecific sentence, subject to the court’s acceptance of the agreement.\n\nl94 See also USAM § 9-27.3oo (“Once the decision to prosecute has been made, the atorney for the government\nshould charge . . . the most serious offense that is consistent with the nature of the defendant’s conduct, and that is\nlikely to result in a sustainable conviction.”).\nl23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4447", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004455.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l58 of 349\n4. FRPC 4-8.4 — Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(c) states that a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,\ndeceit, or misrepresentation.\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(d) prohibits a lawyer from engaging in conduct in connection with the practice\nof law that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\n\nIn Florida Bar v. Frederick, 756 So. 2d 79, 87 (Fla. 2ooo), the court noted that FRPC\n4-8.4(d) is not limited to conduct that occurs in a judicial proceeding, but can be applied to\n“conduct in connection with the practice of law.” In Florida Bar v. Shankman, 4l So. 3d l66, l72\n(Fla. 2olo), for example, an atorney’s continuous hiring and firing of firms to assist in the client’s\nmater resulted in delayed <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the case and constituted a violation of FRPC 4-8.4(d) due\nto the delay in the administration of justice and the increased costs to the client.7°!\n\n2ol OPR also examined FRPC 4-3.8, Special Responsibilities of a Prosecutor. Nothing in the text of that rule,\nhouever, was relevant to the issues addressed in this Report. A comment to FRPC Rule 4-3.8 notes that Florida has\nadopted the American Bar Association (ABA) Standards of Criminal Justice Relating to the Prosecution Function.\nThese “standards,” houever, are not binding rules of conduct but rather provide guidance to prosecutors. Indeed, the\nABA has expressly stated that these standards “are not intended to serve as the basis for the imposition of professional\ndiscipline, to create substantive or procedural rights for accused or convicted persons, to create a standard of care for\ncivil liability, or to serve as a predicate for a motion to suppress evidence or dismiss a charge.” OPR does not consider\nthe ABA standards as binding on the conduct of Department prosecutors.\n\nl3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4455", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004457.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l6o of 349\nCHAPTER TWO\nPART THREE: ANALYSIS\n\nI. OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. Asa result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconceming the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nI. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, two years .. . , registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority. ... [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, l... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4457", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004458.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l6l of 349\ndifferent points in time, and regarding different decisions. Menchel, for example, participated in\nformulating the USAO’s initial writen offer to the defense, but he had no involvement with actions\nor decisions made after August 3, 2oo7. Sloman was absent during part of the most intense\nnegotiations in September 2oo7 and did not see the final, signed version of the NPA until he\nreturned. Villafafia and Lourie participated in the negotiations, and Lourie either made decisions\nduring the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the defense and State Atorney’s Office, or at least\nindicated agreement pending Acosta’s approval. In any event, whatever the level of Sloman’s,\nMenchel’s, Lourie’s, and Villafafia’s involvement, they acted with the knouledge and approval of\nAcosta.\n\nUnder OPR’s analytical framework, an atorney who makes a good faith atempt to\nascertain the obligations and standards imposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given\nsituation does not commit professional misconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith\natempt to ascertain and comply with the obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not\nlimited to, the fact that the atorney consulted with a supervisor.*°? In this regard, OPR’s\nframework is similar to a standard provision of the professional conduct rules of most state bars,\nwhich specify that a subordinate lawyer does not engage in misconduct if that lawyer acts in\naccordance with a supervisory lawyer’s reasonable <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of an arguable question of\nprofessional duty. See, e.g., FRPC 4-5.2(b). Therefore, in addition to the fact that OPR did not\nfind a violation of a clear and unambiguous standard as discussed belou, OPR concludes that\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia did not commit professional misconduct with respect to\nany aspect of the NPA because they acted under Acosta’s direction and with his approval.\n\nWI. OPR FOUND THAT NONE OF THE SUBJECTS VIOLATED A CLEAR AND\nUNAMBIGUOUS STATUTE, PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY RULE OR\nSTANDARD, OR DEPARTMENT REGULATION OR POLICY, IN\nNEGOTIATING, APPROVING, OR ENTERING INTO THE NPA\nA central issue OPR addressed in its investigation relating to the NPA was whether any of\n\nthe subjects, in developing, negotiating, or entering into the NPA, violated any clear and\n\nunambiguous standard established by rule, regulation, or policy. OPR does not find professional\nmisconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous\nstandard. OPR considered three specific areas: (l) standards implicated by the decision to decline\n\na federal court prosecution; (2) standards implicated by the decision to resolve the federal\n\ninvestigation through a non-prosecution agreement; and (3) standards implicated by any of the\n\nNPA’s provisions, including the promise not to prosecute unidentified third parties. As discussed\n\nbelou, OPR concludes that in each area, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his\n\ndecisions were based on corrupt or improper influences, the U.S. Atorney possessed broad\ndiscretionary authority to proceed as he saw fit, authority that he could delegate to subordinates,\nand that Acosta’s exercise of his discretionary authority did not breach any clear and unambiguous\nstandard. As a result, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\n\n2o2 The failure to fully advise a supervisor of relevant and material facts can warrant a finding that the subordinate\n\natorney has not acted in “good faith.” OPR did not find evidence supporting such a conclusion here, and Acosta did\n\nnot claim that he was unaware of material facts needed to make his decision.\n\nl34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4458", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004461.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l64 of 349\nagreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\n\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\n\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>.”\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §8§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o6 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo446l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004464.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l67 of 349\n3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafafia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4464", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004467.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l7o of 349\nnarrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.?!” The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?!3\n\nde The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by Reasonable\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natorneys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at . . . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.?'* OPR also\node In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all frve subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have joined with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4467", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004470.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l73 of 349\nrecord, no restitution, no sex offender status, publication at a trial of\nthe names of certain victims that didn’t want their names revealed\nand the general difficulties of a trial for the victims and their\nfamilies.\n\nAlthough his emails shoued that, at the time, he advocated for prosecution of Epstein,\nLourie told OPR it was also his general recollection that “everybody at the USAO working on the\nmater had expressed concerns at various times about the long-term viability of a federal\nprosecution of Epstein due to certain factual and legal hurdles, as well as issues with the\ncooperation and desires of the victims.”\n\nSimilarly, Menchel—who had experience prosecuting sexual assault crimes—recalled\nunderstanding that many of the victims were unwilling to go forward and would have experienced\nadditional trauma as a result of a trial, and some had made statements exonerating Epstein.\nMenchel told OPR he believed that if the USAO had filed the proposed charges against Epstein,\nEpstein would have elected to go to trial. In Menchel’s view, the USAO therefore had to weigh\nthe risk of losing at trial, and thereby re-traumatizing the victims, against the benefits gained\nthrough a negotiated result, which ensured that Epstein served time in jail, registered as a sexual\noffender, and made restitution to his victims.\n\nSloman also recalled witness challenges and concerns about the viability of the\ngovernment’s legal theories. He told OPR:\n\n[I]t seemed to me you had a tranche of witnesses who were not going\nto be reliable. You had a tranche [of] witnesses who were going to\nbe severely impeached. People who loved Jeffrey Epstein who\nthought he was a Svengali . . . who were going to say I told him I\nwas l8 years old.\n\nYou had witnesses who were scared to death of the public light\nbeing shoun on them because their parents didn’t even knou -- had\nvery vulnerable victims. You had all of these concerns.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he recalled discussions with his senior managers about the victims’\ngeneral credibility and reluctance to testify and the evidentiary strength of the case, all of which\nfactored into the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. He acknouledged that his understanding of the facts was not\n“sranular” and did not encompass a detailed understanding of each victim’s expected testimony,\nbut he trusted that his “team” had already “done the diligence necessary” to make\nrecommendations about the evidentiary strength of the case. Acosta recalled discussing the facts\nwith Sloman and Menchel, and possibly Lourie, none of whom had as detailed an understanding\nof the facts as Villafafia. Nevertheless, OPR credits Acosta’s statement that he reasonably\nbelieved, based on his conversations with others who expressed this view, that a trial would pose\nsignificant evidentiary challenges.\n\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony regarding witness challenges,\nincluding the FBI co-case agent, who recalled during his OPR interview that some of the victims\nhad expressed concern for their safety and “a lot of them d[id]n’t want to take the stand, and\n\nl46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo447o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004472.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l75 of 349\n\nThe USAO might have been able to surmount the evidentiary, legal, and policy issues\npresented by a federal prosecution of Epstein. Villafafia, in particular, believed she could have\nprevailed had she taken the case to trial, and even after the NPA was negotiated, she repeatedly\nrecommended declaring Epstein in breach and proceeding with an indictment, because she\ncontinued to have confidence in the case.”*? Oosterban and others also believed that the\ngovernment would succeed at trial. Furthermore, the victims were not a uniform group. Some of\nthem were afraid of testifying or having their identities made public; others wanted Epstein\nprosecuted, but even among those, it is not clear hou many expressed a willingness to testify at a\ntrial; and still others provided information favorable to Epstein. In the end, Acosta assumed\nresponsibility for deciding hou to resolve the Epstein investigation and weighing the risks and\nbenefits of a trial versus those of a pre-charge disposition. His determination that a pre-charge\ndisposition was appropriate was not unreasonable under the circumstances.\n\nAlthough evidentiary and witness issues explain the subject supervisors’ concerns about\nwinning a potential trial and why the USAO would have sought some sort of pre-charge\ndisposition, they do not fully explain why Acosta decided to pursue a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> as\nopposed to a traditional federal plea agreement. OPR did not find in the contemporaneous records\na memorandum or other memorialization of the reasoning underlying Acosta’s decision to offer a\nstate-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> or the terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7.\n\nAccording to Acosta, “In 2oo6, it would have been extremely unusual for any United States\nAtorney’s Office to become involved in a state solicitation case, even one involving underage\nteens,” because solicitation was “the province of state prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR that he\ndeveloped “a preference for deferring to the state” to “make it clear that [the USAO was] not\nstepping on something that is a purely local mater, because we [didn’t] want bad precedent for\nthe sake of the larger human trafficking issue.” Acosta also told OPR that it was his understanding\nthat the PBPD would not have brought the case to federal investigators if the State Atorney’s\nOffice had pursued a sanction against Epstein that included jail time and sexual offender\nregistration. Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in the case as limited to preventing the “manifest\ninjustice” that, in Acosta’s view, would have resulted from the state’s original plea proposal.\nAcosta acknouledged that if the investigation had begun in the federal system, he would not have\nviewed the terms set out in the NPA as a satisfactory result, but it was adequate to serve as a\n“backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he described as “a polite way of saying[,\n“|encouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]” In sum, Acosta told OPR that the Epstein case\nlay in “uncharted territory,” there was no certainty that the USAO would prevail if it went to trial,\nand a potentially unfavorable outcome had to be “weighed against a certain plea with registration\nthat would make sure that the public knew that this person was a sex offender.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he discussed the case primarily with Sloman and Menchel, and both\ntold OPR that while they did not share Acosta’s federalism concerns, they recalled that Acosta had\nthe terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7. Therefore, any allegations against the prosecutors could not have\nplayed a significant role in Acosta’s decisions as reflected in the term sheet.\n\n22o Sloman told OPR that Villafafia “always believed in the case.”\nl48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4472", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004473.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l76 of 349\nbeen concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.*”” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . I was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\neee Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4473", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004476.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l79 of 349\nfriendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.?”*\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4476", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004478.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l8l of 349\n\nMenchel told OPR that when he and Sanchez were in the USAO, they had a social\nrelationship, which included, in 2oo3, “a handful of dates over a period of two to three weeks. We\ndecided that . . . this was probably best not to pursue, and we mutually agreed to not do that.””°\nApart from that, he stated they were “close” and “chung out,” and he asserted that this was knoun\nin the office at the time. Menchel said that his relationship with Sanchez “changed dramatically”\nwhen she left the office for private practice, and that by the time he became involved in the Epstein\ninvestigation, he had dated and married his wife, and his contact with Sanchez would “most likely”\nhave been at office events and when she atended his wedding.*?’ Menchel added, “[T]hat was\nthree and a half years [prior] for a very brief period of time, and I don’t think I gave it a moment’s\nthought.”\n\nWhen asked by OPR about the basis for the decision to make an offer of a two-year term\nof incarceration, Menchel said that he did not recall discussions about the two-year offer and did\nnot recall hou the office arrived at that figure. In response to OPR’s question, Menchel stated that\nhis relationship with Sanchez did “[n]ot at all” affect his handling of the Epstein case. Moreover,\nMenchel asserted that the contemporaneous documentary record supports a conclusion that it was\nAcosta, not Menchel, who made the decision to resolve the case with the two-year term.\n\nOPR carefully considered the documentary record on this point, as well as the statements\nto OPR from Menchel, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta, and concludes that there is no evidence\nsupporting the suggestion that the plea was instigated by Menchel as a favor to defense counsel.\nThe USAO’s first plea overture to defense counsel, which took place sometime before June 26,\n2oo7, occurred when Menchel spoke with Sanchez about the possibility of resolving the federal\ncase with a state plea that required jail time and sexual offender registration. According to the\nemail, “[iJt was a non-starter” for the defense. In the lengthy email exchange with Villafafia in\nearly July 2oo7, Menchel told her that his discussion with Sanchez about a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>\nwas made with Acosta’s “full knouledge.” Acosta corroborated this statement, telling OPR that\nalthough he did not remember a specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, he was certain Menchel would not have discussed this potential <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> with defense\ncounsel “without having discussed it with me.” Moreover, the defense did not immediately\n226 Acosta, Sloman, and Lourie each told OPR that in 2oo7, he was not aware that Menchel had previously dated\nSanchez. OPR questioned the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer regarding whether Menchel had an\nobligation to inform his supervisors of his dating relationship. The Professional Responsibility Officer said that it\nwould depend on “hou long the relationship was and hou compromised the individual felt he might appear to be,”\nbut he would have expected Menchel to raise the issue with Acosta. The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR\nthat if he had been approached for advice at the time, he would have asked for more facts, but “[g]iven the sensitivity\nof the [Epstein] mater, [my advice] would probably have been to tell him to step back and let somebody else take it\nover.” Menchel told OPR that if his relationship with Sanchez had turned into something more than a handful of\ndates, he would have advised his supervisors. Although OPR does not conclude Menchel’s prior relationship with\nSanchez influenced the Epstein investigation, OPR assesses that it would have been prudent for Menchel to have\ninformed his supervisors so they could make an independent assessment as to whether his continued involvement in\nthe Epstein investigation might create the appearance of a loss of impartiality.\nal Menchel’s Outlook records also indicate he scheduled lunch with Sanchez on at least one occasion, in early\n2oo6, after she left the USAO.\n\n228 In addition, Villafafia recalled Menchel stating at the July 26, 2oo7 meeting that “Alex has decided to offer\na two year state deal.”\nl54\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4478", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004480.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l83 of 349\nincluding one called by the USAO to offer the NPA term sheet <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>—and a sixth meeting\ntogether with the State Atorney and the lead state prosecutor to discuss the state plea. Acosta\natended only one pre-NPA meeting. After the NPA was signed and before Epstein entered his\nstate guilty pleas, the subject supervisors and the defense team had one substantive meeting, one\nunscheduled meeting on a procedural mater, and a meeting with one defense atorney in\npreparation for a conference call; in addition, Acosta had the breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz.?”°\n\nParticipants\nimproprieties and federal\n| jurisdiction issues\nJune 26, 2oo7 | Sloman / Menchel / Dershouitz / Black | Defense presents legal issues,\nLourie / Villafafia / Lefcourt / Sanchez | investigation improprieties, and\nfederal jurisdiction issues\nLourie / Villafaia Sanchez\nSept. 7, 2oo7 | Acosta /Oosterban/ | Starr / Lefkouitz/ | Defense presents counteroffer\n———\nVillafaia’s co-counsel\nsuccessor / Villafafia | / Goldberger Belohlavek re state plea\nprovision of NPA\nterms and likely appeal to\nDepartment\n(unscheduled) | Acosta) Dershouitz) atorney representative\nprocedure\nDec. l4, 2oo7 | Acosta / Sloman / Starr /Wemberg/ | Defense presents federal\nSS eS\nsenior AUSA Lefcourt and request for de novo review\nJan. 7, 2oo8 (l) Acosta / Sloman (l) Sanchez Defense presents USAO\n(2) Acosta / Sloman (2) Starr / improprieties and “watered-\n(conference call) Lefkouitz/ Sanchez | doun” <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>\n= In addition, all of the subjects took phone calls from various defense atommeys, and although numerous\ndocumentary records refer to such calls, there may have been others for which OPR located no record.\nl56\nDOJ-OGR-oooo448o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004481.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l84 of 349\n\nOPR explored the subject supervisors’ reasoning for accommodating the defense requests\nfor in-person meetings and whether such accommodation was unusual. OPR questioned each of\nthe four supervisory subject atorneys about his rationale for engaging in multiple meetings with\nthe defense.\n\nLourie could not recall his reasoning for meeting with Epstein’s defense counsel, but he\ntold OPR that his general practice was to meet with defense counsel when asked to do so. Lourie\nrecognized that some prosecutors—like Villafafia—viewed meeting with the defense as a sign of\n“weakness,” but in Lourie’s view, “information is pouer,” and as long as the USAO did not share\ninformation with the defense but rather listened to their arguments, meetings were “all pouer to\nus.” Lourie explained that by meeting with the defense, “[Y]ou’re geting the information that\nthey think is important; that they’re going to focus on. The witnesses that they think are liars... .\nAnd so you can form all of that into your strategy.” Lourie also told OPR that giving defense\ncounsel the opportunity to argue the defense position is an important “part of the process” that\nhelped ensure procedural fairness, allouing them to “believe that they are geting heard.” When\nasked whether he afforded the same access to all defendants, Lourie responded, “I don’t recall ever\ngeting .. . so many requests for meetings . . . and so many appeals and so many audiences that\n[Epstein’s atorneys] got. But this was I think the first time that that’s really happened.”\n\nMenchel, too, told OPR that his general view was that “ethically it’s appropriate” to give a\ndefense atorney ‘“‘an audience,” and there was no real “dounside” to doing so. Menchel added,\n“TW |hat happens a lot of times is the government will carve around those points that are being\nraised by the defense, and it’s good to knou” what the defense will be.\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Acosta rejected the notion that his meeting with defense counsel\nwas unusual or outside the norm. He told OPR that his initial meeting with the defense team,\nbefore the NPA was signed, was “not the first and only time that I granted a meeting . . . to defense\natorneys” who requested one. Acosta did not believe it was “atypical” for a U.S. Atorney to meet\nwith opposing counsel, particularly as a case was coming to <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. Sloman corroborated\nAcosta on this point, telling OPR that Acosta typically met with defense atorneys, and that the\nUSAO handled requests for meetings from Epstein’s counsel “in the normal course.” Furthermore,\nAcosta said that notwithstanding that meeting and all the other “process” granted to the defense\nby the USAO and the Department, “we successfully held firm in our positions” on the key elements\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>—that is, the requirements that Epstein be incarcerated, register as a sexual\noffender, and provide monetary damages to the victims.\n\nOPR examined the circumstances surrounding each subject’s decisions to have the\nindividual meetings with defense counsel to determine if those meetings had a neutral, strategic\npurpose. The first meeting, on February l, 2oo7, folloued a phone call between Lourie and one\nof Epstein’s atorneys, in which the atorney asked for a chance to “make a pitch” about the\nvictims’ lack of credibility and suggested that Epstein might agree to an interview follouing that\npitch. Villafafia objected to meeting with the defense, but she recalled that Lourie told her she was\nnot being a “strategic thinker,” and that he believed the meeting could lead to a debriefing of\nEpstein. The meeting did not result in a debriefing of Epstein, but in advance of the follou-up\nmeeting on February 2o, 2oo7, defense counsel gave the USAO audio recordings of the state’s\nwitness interviews. Contemporaneous documents indicate that Lourie was unpersuaded by the\ndefense arguments. After Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum, Lourie suggested\n\nl57\nDOJ-OGR-oooo448l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004489.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l92 of 349\n\nWith regard to her comment about “avoid[ing] the press,” Villafafia told OPR that her goal\nwas to protect the anonymity of the victims. She said that the case was far more likely to be\ncovered by the Palm Beach press, which had already writen articles about Epstein, than in Miami,\nand “if [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into the\ncourthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper.”\n\nIn evaluating the emails, OPR reviewed all the email exchanges between Villafafia, as well\nas Sloman and Acosta, and Lefkouitz and other defense counsel, including the portions redacted\nfrom the publicly released emails (except for a few to or from Acosta, copies of which OPR did\nnot locate in the USAO records). OPR also considered the emails in the broader context of\nVillafafia’s overall conduct during the federal investigation of Epstein. The documentary record,\nas well as witness and subject interviews, establishes that Villafafia consistently advocated in favor\nof prosecuting Epstein and worked for months touard that goal. She repeatedly pressed her\nsupervisors for permission to indict Epstein and made numerous efforts to expand the scope of the\ncase. She opposed meetings with the defense team, and nearly withdrew from the case because\nher supervisors agreed to those meetings. Villafafia objected to the decision to resolve the case\nthrough a guilty plea in state court, and she engaged in a lengthy and heated email exchange with\nMenchel about that subject. When she was assigned the task of creating an agreement to effect\nthat <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, Villafafia fought hard during the ensuing negotiations to hold the USAO’s position\ndespite defense counsel’s aggressive tactics.\n\nOPR also considered statements of her supervisors regarding her interactions with defense\ncounsel. Sloman, in particular, told OPR that reports that Villafafia “was soft on Epstein...\ncouldn’t have been further from the truth.” Sloman added that Villafafia “did her best to implement\nthe decisions that were made and to hold Epstein accountable.” Lourie similarly told OPR that\nwhen he read the district court’s February 2ol9 opinion in the CVRA litigation and the emails\nfrom Villafafia cited in that opinion, he was “surprised to see hou nice she was to them. And she\nwinds up taking it on the chin for being so nice to them. When I knou the whole time she was the\none who wanted to go after him the most.” The AUSA who assisted Villafafia on the investigation\ntold OPR “everything that [Villafafia] did . . . was, as far as I could tell, [ ] completely pro\nprosecution.”\n\nBecause the emails in question were publicly disclosed without context and without other\ninformation shouing Villafafia’s consistent efforts to prosecute Epstein and to assist victims, a\npublic narrative developed that Villafafia colluded with defense counsel to benefit Epstein at the\nexpense of the victims. After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that\nnarrative to be inaccurate. The USAO’s and Villafafia’s interactions with the victims can be\ncriticized, as OPR does in several respects in this Report, but the evidence is clear that any missteps\nVillafafia may have made in her interactions with victims or their atorneys were not made for the\npurpose of silencing victims. Rather, the evidence shous that Villafafia, in particular, cared deeply\nabout Epstein’s victims. Before the NPA was signed, she raised to her supervisors the issue of\nconsulting with victims, and after the NPA was signed, she drafted leters to notify victims\nidentified in the federal investigation of the pending state plea proceeding and inviting them to\nappear. The draft leters led defense counsel to argue to Department management that Villafafia\nand Sloman commited professional misconduct by “threaten[ing] to send a highly improper and\nunusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” of the listed victims. Given the full context of Villafafia’s\nconduct throughout her tenure on the case, OPR concludes that her explanations for her emails are\n\nl65\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4489", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004494.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l97 of 349\nsuccessful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based <span class=\"highlight\">Resolution</span>\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4494", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004499.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o2 of 349\nEpstein’s state guilty plea.~° As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”>*!\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerms about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.”°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2oo Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\na In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n252 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstein and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4499", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004501.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o4 of 349\nthe federal investigation in exchange for a plea in state court to a charge that carried a two-year\nsentence. The FBI co-case agent told OPR that, in a meeting to discuss the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, at which\nthe FBI was present, the co-case agent specifically suggested that the USAO wait to pursue a\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> until after the litigation was resolved, but this suggestion was “pushed under the rug”\nwithout comment. Although the co-case agent could not recall who was present, the case agent\nrecalled that Menchel led the meeting, which occurred while the litigation was still pending.\n\nEven after the NPA two-year state plea <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> was presented to the defense, Villafafia\ncontinued to press ahead to have the court resolve the issue concerning the defense production of\nthe computer equipment. On August lo, 2oo7, she asked Lourie for authorization to oppose\nEpstein’s efforts to stay the litigation until after an anticipated meeting between the USAO and the\ndefense, informing Lourie that a victim interviewed that week claimed she started seeing Epstein\nat age l4 and had been photographed in the nude. A few days later, Villafafia told defense counsel\nthat she had “conferred with the appropriate people, and we are not willing to agree to a stay.”\nDefense counsel then contacted Lourie, who agreed to postpone the hearing until after the\nupcoming meeting with Acosta. After the meeting, and when the court sought to reschedule the\nhearing, Villafafia emailed Sloman to ask if she should “put it off’; he replied, “Yes,” and the\nhearing was re-set for September l8, 2oo7. As negotiations touards the NPA progressed,\nhouever, the hearing was postponed indefinitely. Ultimately the NPA itself put the issue to rest\nby specifying that all legal process would be held in abeyance unless and until Epstein breached\nthe agreement.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she had learned through law enforcement channels that the defense\nteam had reviewed the contents of Epstein’s computers. She told OPR that, in her view, “the fact\nthat the defense was trying desperately to put off the hearing . . . was further evidence of the\nimportance of the evidence.”\n\nOPR questioned Acosta about the decisions to initiate, and continue with, the NPA\nnegotiations while the litigation concerning the computers was still pending, and to agree to\npostpone the litigation rather than exhausting all efforts to obtain and review the computer\nevidence. Acosta told OPR that he had no recollection of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the missing\ncomputers, but he believed that “there was a desire to move quickly as opposed to slouly”\nregarding the plea.\n\nMenchel, Sloman, and Lourie also all told OPR that they did not remember Villafafia’s\nefforts to obtain the computers or recalled the issue only “vaguely.” Menchel expressed surprise\nto OPR that a prosecutor could obtain “an entire computer” through the method utilized by\nVillafafia, telling OPR, “I had not heard of that.” Houever, the contemporaneous records shou\nthat Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie had each been aware in 2oo7 of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s missing computer equipment.\n\nVillafafia kept Menchel, in particular, well informed of her efforts to obtain the computer\nequipment. She sent to Menchel, or copied him on, several emails about her plan to obtain the\ncomputer equipment; specifically, her emails on May l8, 2oo7, July 3, 2oo7, and July l6, 2oo7,\nall discussed her proposed steps. Villafafia told OPR that Lourie was involved in early discussions\nabout her proposal to obtain the evidence. Lourie also received Villafafia’s July l6, 2oo7 email\ndiscussing the computer equipment and the plan to obtain it, and on one occasion he spoke directly\n\nl77\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45ol", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004503.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o6 of 349\n\nTo be clear, OPR is not suggesting that prosecutors must obtain all available evidence\nbefore reaching plea agreements or that prosecutors cannot reasonably determine that reaching a\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> is more beneficial than continuing to litigate evidentiary issues. Every case is different\nand must be judged on its oun facts. In this case, houever, given the unorthodox nature of the\nstate-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, the fact that Acosta’s decision to pursue it set the case on a wholly different\ntrack than what had been originally contemplated by his experienced staff, the nature and scope of\nEpstein’s criminal conduct, the circumstances surrounding the removal of the computers from\nEpstein’s residence, and the potential for obtaining evidence revealing serious additional criminal\nconduct, Acosta had a responsibility to ensure that he was fully informed about the consequences\nof pursing the course of action that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flouing\nfrom the express terms of the NPA. In deciding to resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta lost sight\nof the bigger picture that the investigation was not completed and viable leads remained to be\npursued. The decision to forgo the government’s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and to\npursue significant investigative steps should have been made only after careful consideration of\nall the costs and benefits of the proposed action. OPR did not find evidence that Acosta fully\nconsidered the costs of ending the investigation prematurely.”\n\nC. OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of\n\nIncarceration, That It Was Tied to Traditional Sentencing Goals, or That It\nSatisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution\n\nThe heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency\nafforded him concerning his sentence. After offering a deal that required a “non-negotiable”\n24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an l8-month term of incarceration,\nknouing that gain time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served only l3 months.\nEpstein ultimately did not serve even that minimal sentence incarcerated on a full-time basis\nbecause the state alloued Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his\nsentence. As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything else that happened to [Epstein] is exactly what\nshould have happened to him. . . . He had to pay a lot of money. He had to register as a sex\noffender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”\n\nDue to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant\nevents, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of hou the original two-year sentence\nrequirement was developed or by whom. Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject\ninterviews: (l) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled\nguilty to an unspecified charge originally contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years\nrepresented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding\nthe need for a trial. As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of\nthe two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.” He elaborated,\n28s In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney objected to OPR’s conclusion that Acosta knew or\nshould have knoun about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater consideration\nto pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed. Acosta’s atorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in\nthat level of “granularity”; that his “‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that\nit was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him. For the reasons stated above, OPR\nnonetheless concludes that having developed a unique <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> to a federal investigation, Acosta had a greater\nobligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004504.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o7 of 349\n“I’m reconstructing memories of... l2 years ago. I can speculate that at some point, the mater\ncame up, and I or someone else said . .. what would the original charges have likely brought? And\nsomeone said this amount.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall who initially proposed this\nmethod, but he believed that it likely did not result from a single specific discussion but rather\nfrom conversations over a course of time. Acosta could not recall specifically with whom he had\nthese discussions, other than that it would have been Lourie, Menchel, or Sloman. Villafafia was\nnot asked for her views on a two-year sentence, and she had no input into the decision before it\nwas made. Villafafia told OPR that she examined the state statutes and could not validate that a\nstate charge would have resulted in a 24-month sentence. OPR also examined applicable state\nstatutes and the Florida sentencing guidelines, but could not confirm that Epstein was, in fact,\nfacing a potential two-year sentence under charges contemplated by the PBPD.\n\nOn the other hand, during his OPR interview, Lourie “guess[ed]” that “somehou the\ndefense conveyed . . . we’re going to trial if it’s more than two years.” Menchel similarly told\nOPR that he did not knou hou the two year sentence was derived, but “obviously it was a number\nthat the office felt was palatable enough that [Epstein] would take” it. Sloman told OPR that he\nhad no idea hou the two-year sentence proposal was reached.\n\nThe contemporaneous documentary record, houever, provides no indication that Epstein’s\nteam proposed a two-year sentence of incarceration or initially suggested, before the USAO made\nits offer, that Epstein would accept a two-year term of incarceration. As late as July 25, 2oo7—\nonly days before the USAO provided the term sheet to defense counsel—Epstein’s counsel\nsubmited a leter to the USAO arguing that the federal government should not prosecute Epstein\nat all. Furthermore, after the initial “term sheet” was presented and negotiations for the NPA\nprogressed, Epstein’s team continued to strongly press for less or no time in jail.\n\nThe USAO had other charging and sentencing options available to it. The most obvious\nalternative to the two-year sentence proposal was to offer Epstein a plea to a federal offense that\ncarried a harsher sentence. If federally charged, Epstein was facing a substantial sentence under\nthe federal sentencing guidelines, l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment. Houever, it is unlikely that\nhe would have agreed to a plea that required a guidelines sentence, even one at the louer end of\nthe guidelines. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues had been concerned that Epstein\nwould opt to go to trial if charged and presented with the option of pleading to a guidelines\nsentence, and as previously discussed, there were both evidentiary and legal risks atendant upon\na trial in this case. If federally charged, Epstein’s sentencing exposure could have been managed\nby offering him a plea under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c) for a stipulated sentence,\nwhich requires judicial approval. Acosta rejected this idea, houever, apparently because of a\nperception that the federal district courts in the Southern District of Florida did not view Rule ll(c)\npleas favorably and might refuse to accept such a plea and thus limit the USAO’s options.\n\nAnother alternative was to offer Epstein a plea to conspiracy, a federal charge that carried\na maximum five-year sentence. Shortly after Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum\nto her supervisors, Lourie recommended to Acosta charging Epstein by criminal complaint and\noffering a plea to conspiracy “to make a plea atractive.” Similarly, before learning that Menchel\nhad already discussed a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> with Epstein’s counsel, Villafafia had considered\noffering Epstein a plea to one count of conspiracy and a substantive charge, to be served\nconcurrently with any sentence he might receive separately as a result of the state’s outstanding\n\nl8o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004505.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o8 of 349\nindictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>\nthat ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would\nbe sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\ntraditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis. In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004507.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2lo of 349\nthe defendant faced decades in prison for sexual crimes against minors with such an insignificant\nterm of incarceration, and made numerous other concessions to the defense. As OPR has set forth\nin substantial detail in this Report, OPR did not find evidence to support allegations that the\nprosecutors sought to benefit Epstein at the expense of the victims. Instead, the result can more\nappropriately be tied to Acosta’s misplaced concerns about interfering with a traditionally state\ncrime and intruding on state authority. Acosta was also unwilling to abandon the path that he had\nset, even when Villafafia and Lourie advocated to end the negotiations and even though Acosta\nhimself had learned that the state authorities may not have been a reliable partner.\n\nMany of the problems that developed might have been avoided had Acosta engaged in\ngreater consultation with his staff before making key decisions. The contemporaneous records\nrevealed problems with communication and coordination among the five key participants. Acosta\nwas involved to a greater extent and made more decisions than he did in a typical case. Lourie\ntold OPR that it was “unusual to have a U.S. Atorney get involved with this level of detail.”\nMenchel told OPR, “I knou we would have spoken about this case a lot, okay? And I’m sure with\nJeff as well, and there were conversations -- a meeting that I had with Marie and Andy as well.”\nLourie similarly told OPR:\n\nWell, ... he would have been talking to Jeff and Mat, talking to me\nto the extent that he did, he would have been looking at the Pros\nMemo and... the guidance from CEOS, he would have been\nreading the defense atorney’s leters, maybe talking to the State\nAtorney, I don’t knou, just . . . all these different sources of\ninformation he was -- I’m comfortable that he knew the case, you\nknou, that he was, he was reading everything. Apparently, he, you\nknou, read the Pros Memo, he read all the stuff... .\n\nAt the same time, Acosta was significantly removed, both in physical distance and in levels\nin the supervisory chain, from the individuals with the most knouledge of the facts of the case—\nVillafafia and, to a lesser extent, Lourie. Lourie normally would have signed off on the prosecution\nmemorandum on his oun, but as he told OPR, he recognized that the case was going to go through\nthe front office “[b]ecause there was front office involvement from the get go.” Yet, although\nAcosta became involved at certain points in order to make decisions, he did not view himself as\noverseeing the investigation or the details of implementing his decisions. OPR observed that as a\nconsequence, management of the case suffered from both an absence of ounership of the\ninvestigation and failures in communication that affected critical decisions.\n\nOn occasion, Villafafia included Acosta directly in emails, but often, information upon\nwhich Acosta relied for his decisions and information about the decisions Acosta had made\ntraveled through multiple layers between Acosta and Villafafia. Villafafia did draft a detailed,\nanalytical prosecution memorandum, but it is not clear that Acosta read it and instead may have\nrelied on conversations primarily with Menchel and later with Sloman after Menchel’s departure.\nDespite these discussions, though, it is not clear that Acosta was aware of certain information, such\nas Oosterban’s strong opinion from the outset in favor of the prosecution or of Villafafia’s\nconcerns and objections to a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> or the final NPA. Acosta interpreted the state\nindictment on only one charge as a sign that the case was weak evidentially, but it is not clear that\nwhen making his decision to resolve the mater though a state-based plea, he knew the extent to\n\nl83\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004508.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2ll of 349\nwhich Villafafia and Lourie believed that the state had intentionally failed to aggressively pursue\na broader state indictment.\n\nOne example illustrates this communication gap. In a September 2o, 2oo7 email to Lourie\nasking him to read the latest version of the proposed “hybrid” federal plea agreement (calling for\nEpstein to plead to both state and federal charges), Acosta noted, “I don’t typically sign plea\nagreements. We should only go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement. I\ndidn’t even sign the public corruption or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not be the first.”\n(Emphasis added.) In his email to Villafafia, Lourie atached Acosta’s email and instructed\nVillafafia to “change the signature block to your name and send as final to Jay [Lefkouitz].”\n(Emphasis added.) Villafafia raised no objection to signing the agreement. Acosta told OPR that\nhe wanted to give the “trial team” a chance to “speak up and let him knou” if they did not feel\ncomfortable with the agreement. Villafafia, houever, told OPR that she did not understand that\nshe was being given an opportunity to object to the agreement; rather, she believed Acosta wanted\nher to sign it because he was taking an “‘arm’s length” approach and signaling this “was not his\ndeal.” The fact that the top decision maker believed he was giving the line AUSA an opportunity\nto reflect and stop the process if she believed the deal was inappropriate, but the line AUSA\nbelieved she was being ordered to sign the agreement because her boss wanted to distance himself\nfrom the decision, reflects a serious communication gap.\n\nAs another example, at one point, Villafafia, frustrated and concerned about the decisions\nbeing made concerning a possible <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, requested a meeting with Acosta; in a sternly worded\nrebuke, Menchel rejected the request. Although Menchel told OPR that he was not prohibiting\nVillafafia from speaking to Acosta, Villafafia interpreted Menchel’s email to mean that she could\nnot seek a meeting with Acosta. As a consequence, Acosta made his decision about a state\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> and the term of incarceration without any direct input from Villafafia. Acosta told OPR\nthat he was unaware that Villafafia had sought a meeting with him and he would have met with\nher if she had asked him directly. OPR did not find any writen evidence of a meeting involving\nboth Acosta—the final decision maker—and Villafafia—the person most knouledgeable about the\nfacts and the law—before Acosta made his decision to resolve the case through state charges or to\noffer the two-year term, and Villafafia said she did not have any input into the decision. Although\na U.S. Atorney is certainly not required to have such direct input, and it may be that Menchel\npresented what he believed to be Villafafia’s views, OPR found no evidence that Acosta was aware\nof Villafafia’s strong views about, and objections to, the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>.*°\n\nTwo logistical problems hindered effective communication. First, the senior managers\ninvolved in the case—Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel—had offices located in Miami, while the\noffices of the individuals most familiar with facts of the case—Villafafia and, to a lesser extent,\nLourie—were located in West Palm Beach. Consequently, Villafafia’s discussions with her senior\n256 In her 2ol7 Declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that, given the challenges of obtaining\nvictims’ cooperation with a federal prosecution, “I believed and still believe that a negotiated <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the mater\nwas in the best interests of the [USAO] and the victims as a whole. The [USAO] had also reached that same\nconclusion.” Several subjects pointed to this statement as indicating that Villafafia in fact supported the NPA. In her\nOPR interview, houever, Villafafia drew a distinction between resolving the investigation through negotiations that\nled to what in her view was a reasonable outcome, which she would have supported, and “this negotiated <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>” —\nthat is, the NPA—which she did not support.\n\nl84\nDOJ-OGR- oooo45o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004509.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l2 of 349\nmanagers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.”*”\n\nSecond, key personnel were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the... bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third\nad In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004510.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l3 of 349\nparties.7°* The rush to reach a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> should not have led the USAO to agree to such a\nsignificant provision without a full consideration of the potential consequences and justification\nfor the provision. It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n2n8 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s\n\nunderstood that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you\n\nknou the husband’s willing to go and take the weight .... This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004511.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l4 of 349\nfrom Villafafia and others, but given the highly unusual procedure being considered, his decision\nshould have been made only after a full consideration of all of the possible ramifications and\nconsequences of pushing the mater into the state court system, with which neither Villafafia nor\nthe other subjects had experience, along with consideration of the legal and evidentiary issues and\npossible means of overcoming those issues. OPR did not find evidence indicating that such a\nmeeting or discussion with the full team was held before the decision was made to pursue the\nstate-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term of incarceration, or\nbefore the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed. As Acosta later recognized and told OPR,\n“And a question that I think is a valid one in my mind is, did the focus on, let’s just get this done\nand get a jail term, mean that we didn’t take a step back and say, let’s evaluate hou this train is\nmoving?”\n\nMany features of the NPA were given inadequate consideration, including core provisions\nlike the term of incarceration and sexual offender registration, with the result that Epstein was able\nto manipulate the process to his benefit. Members of his senior staff held differing opinions about\nsome of the issues that Acosta felt were important and that factored into his decision-making.\nThere does not seem to be a point, houever, at which those differing opinions were considered\nwhen forming a strategy; rather, Acosta seems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him\nfolloued and atempted to implement but without a considered strategy beyond ataining the three\ncore elements. As the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had authority to proceed in this manner, but many of\nthe problems that developed with the NPA might have been avoided with a more thoughtful\napproach. As Acosta belatedly recognized, “[I]f I was advising a fellou U.S. Atorney today, I\nwould say, think it through.”?*?\n\nNo one of the individual problems discussed above necessarily demonstrates poor\njudgment by itself. Houever, in combination, the evidence shous that the state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>\nwas ill conceived from the start and that the NPA resulted from a flawed decision-making process.\nFrom the time the USAO opened its investigation, Acosta recognized the federal interest in\nprosecuting Epstein, yet after that investigation had run for more than a year, he set the\ninvestigation on a path not originally contemplated. Having done so, he had responsibility for\nensuring that he received and considered all of the necessary information before puting an end to\na federal investigation into serious criminal conduct. Acosta’s failure to adequately consider the\nfull ramifications of the NPA contributed to a process and ultimately a result that left not only the\nline AUSA and the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also caused victims and the public to question\nthe motives of the prosecutors and whether any reasonable measure of justice was achieved.\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he chose a course of\naction that was in marked contrast to the action that the Department would reasonably expect an\natorney exercising good judgment to take.\n\n259 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney acknouledged that “[t]he mater would have\nbenefited from more consistent staffing and atention.”\nl87\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004514.jpg": ". . . nm: .\n> Timeline of Key Events for Crime Victims’ Rights Act Analysis\na\n- Aug lo — FBI Dec 7 — Sloman tells July 7 —Jane Doe files an Additional Key Dates\n| begins interviewing Villafafia to “hold the emergency petition against\nvictims leter” re notification to the United States asserting\npa Santen acgeurdna Shad violations of the CVRA VG\nq plea hearing Marl? = Villasita : nits el\ncr BPRS carrer teres voliedee alte July 9 ~ USAO begins regarding CVRA\nte st ip ; : = = _ ang Dee ls aces sands atormeys for victims sending leters to victims\n—i ea ; a vena res 7 leter to Epstein’s counsel Mar-May — FBI concerning <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of Oct 2oll = DOJ revises\nee ard ts advising USAO will defer Seana federal investigation AG Guidelines\nof the girls i ges tre eTe Tas interviews victims\nnotification of state piea\nto state officials May 29, 2ol5 —CVRA\n= Rigid tie Jan lo - FBI new rights\n6 =—— sends VNS leter i oe\n: to some victims Eeb2l, 2ol9 Dit Ct\n= US. violated the\na : Jul 6, 2ol9 — Epstein\n2oo6 2oo7 2oo8 | arrested on SDNY\n= Sept 6 — Villafafia e-mail to | ug lo, 2ol9 — Epstein\nJ Sloman raising victim Jan 3l-Feb | —FBI, Spin tie es “is\n8 consultation issue, which Villafada, and CEOS in custody\na) Sloman forwards to Acosta atlomey ilerview Viclins Sep l6, 2ol9 — Dist.

The Case Agents and Villafafia Solicit Some Victims’ Opinions about\n\nResolving the Federal Investigation\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when she and the case agents met with victims, “we would ask\nthem hou they wanted the case to be resolved.”7*!\n\nAnd most of them wanted the case to be resolved via a plea. Some\nof them wanted him not to be prosecuted at all. Most of them did\nnot want to have to come to court and testify. They were very\nworried about their privacy rights. Some of them wanted him to go\nto jail. But... [s]ome of them talked about bad experiences with\nthe State Atorney’s Office. And so, I felt like sending them back to\nthe State Atorney’s Office was not something that they would have\nsupported.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she also recalled that some victims “expressed . . . concern about\ntheir safety,” and were worried that Epstein would find out about their participation in the\ninvestigation. In her 2ol7 declaration submited in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that the\ntwo CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my\nrole was to evaluate the entire situation, consider the input received from all of the victims, and\nallou the Office to exercise its prosecutorial discretion accordingly.”** She also noted that some\nvictims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would\nhave on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”\n\nIn the FBI case agent’s 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During\ninterviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be\nprosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s]\n\nvictims .... A majority of the victims expressed concern about the\n\npossible disclosure of their identities to the public. A number of the\n\nvictims raised concerns about having to testify and/or their parents\n\nfinding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein. Additionally,\n26 Villafafia created for OPR a chart listing victims identified in the state and federal investigations, with\nnotations indicating several with whom Villafafia recalled discussing their opinions about resolving the case. The\nchart, houever, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafafia told OPR that the information contained in the\nchart was based on her memory of her interactions with each victim. OPR was unable to determine the details or\nextent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2oo7, because Villafafia did not have contemporaneous\nnotes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information\nabout the victims’ desired outcomes. The victims who provided information to OPR did not recall discussing potential\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal investigation with anyone from the government.\n282 In the declaration, Villafafia stated, “Jane Doe 2 specifically told me that she did not want Epstein\nprosecuted.”\n\n2ol\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4525", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004526.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 229 of 349\nfor some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall,\nmany of the victims were troubled about the existence of the\ninvestigation. They displayed feelings of embarrassment and\nhumiliation and were reluctant to talk to investigators. Some\nvictims who were identified through the investigation refused even\nto speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and\ngeting to the truth were always at the forefront of our handling of\nthe investigation.\nThe case agent told OPR that although she encountered victims who were “strong” and\n“believable,” she did not encounter any who vigorously advocated for the prosecution of Epstein.\nRather, “they were embarrassed,” “didn’t want their parents to knou,” and “wanted to forget.””*\nAs of September 24, 2oo7, the date the NPA was signed, Villafafia informed Epstein\natorney Lefkouitz that she had compiled a preliminary list of victims including “34 confirmed\nminors” and 6 other potential minor victims who had not yet been interviewed by the FBI.7*4\nAlthough the government had contacted many victims before the NPA was signed, Villafafia\nacknouledged during the CVRA litigation that “individual victims were not consulted regarding\nthe agreement.”\nB. Before the NPA Is Signed, Villafafia Expresses Concern That Victims Have\nNot Been Consulted\nBefore the NPA was signed, Villafafia articulated to her supervisors concerns about the\ngovernment’s failure to consult with victims.\nl. July 2oo7: Villafafia’s Email Exchanges with Menchel\nIn July 2oo7, Villafafia learned that Menchel had discussed with defense counsel Sanchez\na possible state <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> to the federal investigation of Epstein. Villafafia was upset by this\ninformation, and sent a strongly worded email to Menchel voicing her concerns. (A full account\nof their email exchange is set forth at Chapter Two, Part One, Section IV.A.2.) In that email, she\ntold him that it was “inappropriate [for you] to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE, the victims, and me. These plea negotiations violate . . . all of the\n283 The case agent also noted that the victim who became CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 had expressed in her\nApril 2oo7 video-recorded FBI interview her opinion that “nothing should happen to Epstein.”\n284 The “victims’ list” for purposes of the NPA was intended to include the names of all individuals whom the\ngovernment was prepared to name in a charging document “as victims of an offense enumerated in l8 U.S.C. § 2255.”\nAlthough the charges Villafafia proposed on May l, 2oo7, were based on crimes against l3 victims, thereafter, as\nexplained in Chapter Two of this Report, she continued to revise the proposed charges, adding and removing victims\nas the federal investigation developed further evidence. At the time the NPA was signed, the proposed charges were\nbased on crimes against l9 victims, but others had been identified for potential inclusion.\n2o2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4526", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004527.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 23o of 349\nvarious iterations of the victims’ rights legislation.””* Villafafia explained to OPR her reference\nto the victims:\n\n[M]y concern was that [Menchel] was violating the CVRA which\n\nrequires the atorneys for the government, which[] includes me[,] to\n\nconfer with the victims, and the [VRRA], which requires the agents\n\nto keep the victims apprised of what’s happening with the case. So\n\nin essence, I felt like he was exposing both myself and the agents to\n\nallegations of not abiding by our obligations by engaging in these\n\nplea negotiations without leting us knou about it.7°°\n\nIn his reply to Villafafia’s email, and after noting that he found her email “totally\ninappropriate,” Menchel denied that he had violated any Departmental policy, and he noted that\n“Ta]s Chief of the Criminal Division, I am the person designated by the U.S. Atorney to exercise\nappropriate discretion in deciding whether certain pleas are appropriate and consistent with”\nDepartmental policy. Perceiving Menchel’s rebuke as a criticism of her judgment, Villafafia\nresponded, “[R]aising concerns about the forgoten voices of victims in this case should not be\nclassified as a lapse in judgment” and that her “first and only concern in this case. . . is the victims.”\nMenchel told OPR that he did not view his conversation with Sanchez as a plea offer,\nasserted that he was not obligated to consult with victims during preliminary setlement\nnegotiations, and noted that he left the USAO before the NPA was fully negotiated or signed.\nMenchel told OPR that “you have discussions . . . with [the] defense all the time, and the notion\nthat even just having a general discussion is something that must be veted with victims . . . is not\neven ... in the same universe as to hou I think about this.” Menchel also observed that on the\nvery day that Villafafia criticized him for engaging in setlement negotiations without consulting\nher, the FBI, or the victims, Villafafia had herself sent an email to Sanchez offering “to discuss the\npossibility of a federal <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of Mr. Epstein’s case that could run concurrently with any state\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>,” without having spoken to the victims about her proposal.”*”\n288 Villafafia told OPR that “some victims, I felt strongly, would have objected to [a state-only disposition].”\nVillafafia stated to OPR that at the time Menchel engaged in such negotiations, he would only have been aware of the\nvictim information contained in her prosecution memorandum, which included information about the “effects on the\nvictims” but did not likely contain information as to “hou they would like the case resolved.” Villafafia asserted that\nMenchel “never reached out to any of the victims to find out what their position would be.” Menchel told OPR that\nthe allegations in Villafafia’s email that he violated the Ashcroft Memo, USAM, and the CVRA were “way out of line\nin terms of what the law is and the policies are.”\n286 As discussed, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not apply before charges were\nfiled against a defendant.\n287 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel asserted that her email to Sanchez was intended\nonly to determine whether Epstein was interested in opening plea negotiations.\n2o3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4527", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004529.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 232 of 349\nChief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.”?! Sloman forwarded this\nemail to Acosta. Villafafia recalled that Sloman responded to her email by telephone, possibly\nafter he had spoken to Acosta, and stated, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.” Villafafia did not recall\nSloman explaining at the time the reason for that instruction.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[WJe’ve\nbeen advised that . . . pre-charge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Sloman did not\nrecall any discussions, before the NPA was signed, about contacting the victims or conferring with\nthem regarding the potential <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the case. Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that\nwe had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek\napproval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the notification issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.”” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”???\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.””* Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate\n22) Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “he was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\n\n282 Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\ni The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n2o4 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto .. . instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4529", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004530.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 233 of 349\ndisagreement” regarding the CVRA’s requirements.””> Oosterban’s disagreement was based on\npolicy considerations, and he told OPR that “from a policy perspective,” CEOS would not “take a\nposition that you wouldn’t consult with [the victims].” Oosterban also told OPR that whether or\nnot the law required it, the victims should have been given an opportunity “to weigh in directly,”\nbut he did not fault the USAO’s motivations for failing to provide that opportunity:\n\nThe people I knou, Andy [Lourie], Jeff [Sloman], . . . were trying\nto do the right thing. . . . [T]hey weren’t acting unethically. I just\ndisagree with the outcome . . . but the point is they weren’t trying\n... to do anything improper . . . it was more of this question of .. .\nyou can let the victims weigh in on this, you can get their input on\nthis and maybe it doesn’t sway you. You still do what you’ re going\nto do but .. . it’s hard to say it was a complete, completely clean\nexercise of . . . prosecutorial discretion when [the USAO] didn’t\nreally knou what [the victims] would say.\n\nSloman told OPR, “I don’t think we had a concern about entering into the NPA at that point\nin terms of notifying victims. . . . I was under the perception that once the NPA was entered into\nand [Epstein] was going to enter a guilty plea in state court that we were going to notify the\nvictims.”\n\nVII. SEPTEMBER 24, 2oo7 — JUNE 3o, 2oo8: AFTER THE NPA IS SIGNED, THE\n\nUSAO MAKES VARIOUS VICTIM NOTIFICATION DECISIONS\n\nThe contemporaneous emails make clear that once the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the\ncase agents planned to inform the victims about the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal investigation.\nHouever, the emails also shou that the USAO was unclear about hou much information could be\ngiven to the victims in light of the NPA’s nondisclosure provision and consulted with Epstein’s\ndefense counsel regarding victim notifications.?”° As a result, although the expectation in the\nUSAO was that the victims would be informed about the NPA, the monetary damages provision,\nand the state plea, the USAO became entangled in more negotiations with the defense atorneys,\nwho strongly objected to the government’s notification plan. In addition, Villafafia and the case\nagents grew concerned that notifying the victims about the NPA monetary damages provision\nwould damage the victims’ credibility if Epstein breached the NPA and the case went to trial. In\nthe end, Acosta decided to defer to the State Atorney’s discretion whether to notify the victims\nabout the state plea, and information about the NPA and the monetary damages provision was not\nprovided to victims until after Epstein pled guilty in June 2oo8.\na Oosterban stated that, in retrospect, “maybe I should have been more aggressive with hou . . . I dealt with\n[the USAO].”\n\n296 The NPA nondisclosure provision stated: “The parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part\nof any public record. If the United States receives a Freedom of Information Act request or any compulsory process\ncommanding the disclosure of the agreement, it will provide notice to Epstein before making that disclosure.”\n2o6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo453o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004531.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 234 of 349\nA. September — October 2oo7: The Case Agents Notify Some Victims about the\nNPA, but Stop When the Case Agent Becomes Concerned about Potential\nImpeachment\n\nIn transmiting the signed NPA to Villafafia on September 24, 2oo7, defense atorney\nLefkouitz asked Villafafia to “do whatever you can to prevent [the NPA] from becoming\npublic.””°’ Villafafia forwarded this email to Acosta, Lourie, and the new West Palm Beach\nmanager noting that, “I don’t intend to do anything with it except put it in the case file.” Acosta\nresponded that he “thought the [NPA] already binds us not to make [it] public except as required\nby law or [FOJA]” and noted that because the USAO would not proactively inform the media\nabout the NPA, “this is the State Atorney[’]s shou.”””° Acosta added, “In other words, what more\ndoes he want?” Villafafia responded, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief\nor FBI or the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.” Lourie agreed, noting that “there really is\nno reason to tell anyone all the details of the non pros or provide a copy. The [PBPD] Chief was\nonly concerned that he not get surprised by all this.”°°? Acosta responded that he would set up a\ncall on September 26, 2oo7, to talk “about who we can tell and hou much.”*°°\n\nAlso on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed the new West Palm Beach manager to\ninform him that once the atorney representative was appointed for the victims, she planned to\n“meet with the girls myself to explain hou the system [for obtaining relief under l8 U.S.C. § 2255]\nwill work.” Villafafia also emailed Lefkouitz stating that she planned to discuss with him “what\nI can tell [the atorney representative] and the girls about the agreement,” and she assured\nLefkouitz that her office “is telling Chief Reiter not to disclose the outcome to anyone.” Villafafia\nalso provided Lefkouitz with a list of potential candidates for the atorney representative position\nand advocated for an atorney representative who would minimize press coverage of the mater.\n\nOn September 26, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Lefkouitz to request guidance on informing the\nvictims about the NPA: “Can you give me a call... J am meeting with the agents and want to\ngive them their marching orders regarding what they can tell the girls.” Villafafia told OPR that\nbecause the government and the defense had not agreed on the atorney representative for the\nvictims, she reached out to the defense at the direction of either Acosta or Sloman in order to\ncoordinate hou to inform the victims about the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the case and the fact that there would\nbe an atorney to assist them in recovering monetary damages from Epstein. Villafafia told OPR\nthat the defense responded to her email by complaining to her supervisors that she should not be\noad Villafafia had assured Lefkouitz that the NPA “would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would\nremain part of our case file. It probably would be subject to a FOIA request, but it is not something that we would\ndistribute without compulsory process.”\n228 Acosta told OPR that he believed that the NPA “would see the light of day” because the victims would have\nto “hear about [their § 2255 rights] from somewhere” and “given the press interest, eventually this would be FOTA’d.”\nad Lourie told OPR that the § 2255 provisions of the NPA “that benefited the victims were there for the victims\nto take advantage of... . and they did. Hou. . . they were going to receive that information and when they were going\nto receive it is a different question, but there’s no . . . issue with the fact that they were going to get that information.”\n3oo OPR was unable to determine whether the call took place.\n\n2o7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo453l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004532.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 235 of 349\ninvolved in such notifications. According to Villafafia, Sloman then directed her to have the case\nagents make the victim notifications.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia directed the case agents to “meet with the victims to provide them\nwith information regarding the terms of the [NPA] and the conclusion of the federal investigation.”\nThe case agent told OPR, “[T]here was a discussion that Marie and I had as\nto... hou we would tell them, and what we would tell them, and what that was I don’t recall, but\nit was the terms of the agreement.” Villafafia believed that if “victims were properly notified of\nthe terms [of the NPA] that applied to them, regarding their right to seek damages from [Epstein],\nand he paid those damages, that the rest of the [NPA] doesn’t need to be disclosed.” Villafafia\n“anticipated that [the case agents] would be able to inform the victims of the date of the state court\nchange of plea [hearing], but that date had not yet been set by state authorities at the time the first\nvictims were notified [by the FBI].” Villafafia told OPR that it was her belief that because the\nUSAO had agreed to a confidentiality clause, the government could not disclose the NPA to the\ngeneral public, but victims could be informed “because by its terms they needed to be told what\nthe agreement was about.” Villafafia told OPR that no one in her supervisory chain expressed a\nconcern that if victims learned of the NPA, they would try to prevent Epstein from entering a plea.\n\nWithin a week after the NPA was signed, news media began reporting that the parties had\nreached a deal to resolve the Epstein case. For example, on October l, 2oo7, the\nNew York Post reported that Epstein “has agreed to plead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes\nat his Florida mansion in a deal that will send him to prison for about l8 months,” and noted that\nEpstein would plead guilty in state court and that “the feds have agreed to drop their probe into\npossible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge.”*\"!\n\nThe case agent recalled informing some victims that “there was an agreement reached” and\n“we would not be pursuing this federally.” In October 2oo7, for example, the case agents met with\nvictim Courtney Wild, “to advise her of the main terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement.”\nAccording to the case agent, during that meeting, the case agents told Wild “that an agreement had\nbeen reached, Mr. Epstein was going to plead guilty to two state charges, and there would not be\na federal prosecution.”*°? Houever, in a declaration filed in 2ol5 in the CVRA litigation, Wild\ndescribed the conversation differently:\n\n[T]he agents explained that Epstein was also being charged in State\n\ncourt and may plea [sic] to state charges related to some of his other\n\nvictims.

Villafafia recalled that during a brief telephone consultation, the Professional\nResponsibility Officer advised her and the case agent that “it’s not really that big a concern, but if\nyou’re concerned about it then you should stop making the notification.”°* In her 2ol7 CVRA\ndeclaration, the case agent stated that after conferring with the USAO, the case agents stopped\nnotifying victims about the NPA.\n\nB. October 2oo7: Defense Atorneys Object to Government Victim Notifications\n\nWhile the case agents and Villafafia considered the impact that notifying the victims about\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the case might have on a potential trial, defense counsel also raised concerns\nabout what the victims could be told about the NPA. As discussed in Chapter Two, after the NPA\nwas signed on September 24, 2oo7, the USAO proposed using a special master to select the\natorney representative for the victims, which led to further discussions about the § 2255 provision.\nOn October 5, 2oo7, when defense atorney Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a leter responding to the\nUSAO’s proposal to use a special master, he cautioned that “neither federal agents nor anyone\nfrom your Office should contact the identified individuals to inform them of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the\ncase” because such communications would “violate the confidentiality of the agreement” and\nwould prevent Epstein from having control over “what is communicated to the identified\nindividuals at this most critical stage.” Lefkouitz folloued this communication with an October\nlo, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, arguing that “[n]either federal agents nor anyone from your Office should\ncontact the identified individuals to inform them of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the case.”°°° Rather,\nLefkouitz wanted to “participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication to the identified\nindividuals.”\n\nOn October 23, 2oo7, Villafafia raised the issue of victim notification with Sloman, stating:\n\nWealso have to contact the victims to tell [them] about the outcome\nof the case and to advise them that an atorney will be contacting\nthem regarding possible claims against Mr. Epstein. If we don’t do\nthat, it may be a violation of the Florida Bar Rules for the selected\natorney to ‘cold call’ the girls.\n\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter Two, on October 23, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent Acosta\na leter stating that Epstein expected to enter a guilty plea in state court on November 2o, 2oo7,\nao The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR that he did not recall the case agent contacting him about\nvictim notification, nor did he recall being involved in the Epstein mater before the CVRA litigation was instituted\nin July 2oo8 and he was assigned to handle the litigation. Villafafia told OPR that they consulted the Professional\nResponsibility Officer over the telephone, the call took no more than “five minutes,” and the Professional\nResponsibility Officer had no other exposure to the case and thus “wouldn’t have [any] context for it.”\n\n3o6 Lefkouitz also argued that direct contact with the victims could violate grand jury secrecy rules.\n2lo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4534", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004535.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 238 of 349\nand thanking Acosta for agreeing on October l2, 2oo7, not to “contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this\nmater.”°°7 Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Acosta\nrevised to clarify the “inaccurate” representations made by Lefkouitz, in particular noting that\nAcosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact. The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\n\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\ncommunications that are typical in these maters. As an example,\nour Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them\nthat either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing]\nthem. Rest assured that we will continue to treat this mater as we\nwould any similarly situated case.°°\nIn a November 5, 2oo7 leter, Sloman complained to Lefkouitz that private investigators\nworking for Epstein had been contacting victims and asking whether government agents had\ndiscussed financial setlement with them. Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some circumstances.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?’”>\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to Investigate,\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been identified in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o2 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\nao8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n3o9 Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to\ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4535", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004536.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 239 of 349\nNPA.*!° The FBI reports of the victim interviews do not mention the NPA or indicate that the\nvictims were asked for their input regarding the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the case. Villafafia acknouledged\nthat she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the\nagreement because “at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and\nthat we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”\n\nOn October l2, 2oo7, the FBI Victim Specialist sent a VNS form notice leter to a victim\nthe case agents had interviewed two days earlier. This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim Specialist sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\nidentified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD. The USAO Informs the Defense That It Intends to Notify Victims by Leter\nabout Epstein’s State Plea Hearing and the <span class=\"highlight\">Resolution</span> of the Federal\nInvestigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the Notification Plan\n\nIn anticipation of Epstein’s state court plea, Villafafia reported on November l6, 2oo7, to\nAcosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that she had learned, from FBI agents who met with\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek, that the State Atorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify\nvictims of the state plea hearing.\n\n[Belohlavek] would still like us to do the victim notifications. The\n\nState does not have a procedure (like we do federally) where the\n\nCourt has to provide a separate room for victims who want to atend\n\njudicial proceedings, so I do not knou hou many victims will\n\nactually want to be present.?!!\nBelohlavek told OPR that she did not recall the conversation referenced by the FBI nor any\ncoordination between her office and federal officials to contact or notify victims about Epstein’s\nstate plea hearing.\n\nOn November l9, 2oo7, Villafafia decided that to avoid any misconduct accusations from\nthe defense about the information given to victims, she “would put the victim notification in\nwriting.” She provided Sloman with a draft victim notification leter, in which among other things,\n3l9 Not all the individuals interviewed qualified for inclusion on the victim list. For example, one would not\ncooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third\nclaimed she had no contact with Epstein.\n\n3ll Villafafia told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or\ntwo victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”\n2l2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4536", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004537.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 24o of 349\nshe would inform victims of the terms of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal case, including Epstein’s\nagreement to plead guilty to state charges and serve l8 months in county jail, and the victims’\nability to seek monetary damages against Epstein. The leter also would invite victims to appear\nat the state court hearing and make a statement under oath or provide a writen statement to be\nfiled by the State Atorney’s Office. Sloman and Villafafia exchanged edits on the draft victim\nnotification leter, and Villafafia also informed Sloman that “[t]here are a few girls who didn’t\nreceive the original leters, so I will need to modify the introductory portion of the leter for\nthose.”?””\n\nSloman informed Lefkouitz of the government’s need to meet its “statutory obligation\n(Justice for All Act of 2oo4) to notify the victims of the anticipated upcoming events and their\nrights associated with the agreement” and his intent to “notify the victims by leter after COB\nThursday, November 29.” Lefkouitz objected to the proposal to notify the victims, asserting that\nit was “incendiary and inappropriate” and not warranted under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4. He\nargued that the defense “should have a right to review and make objections to that submission\nprior to it being sent to any alleged victims.” He also insisted that if any notification leters were\nsent to “victims, who still have not been identified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein\nhas entered his plea” and that the leter should come from the atorney representative rather than\nthe government. On November 28, 2oo7, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia provided Lefkouitz\nwith the draft victim notification leter, which would advise victims that the state court plea was\nto occur on December l4, 2oo7.7\n\nIn a November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz strongly objected to the proposed draft\nnotification leter, arguing that the government was not obligated to send any leter to victims until\nafter Epstein’s plea and sentencing. Lefkouitz also contended that the victims had no right to\nappear at Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing or to provide a writen statement for such a\nproceeding. In a November 3o, 2oo7 reply leter to Lefkouitz, Acosta did not address the\nsubstance of Lefkouitz’s arguments, but accused the defense team of “in essence presenting\ncollateral challenges” delaying effectuation of the NPA, and asserted that if Epstein was\ndissatisfied with the NPA, “we stand ready to unwind the Agreement” and proceed to trial. Shortly\nthereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by leter that he had directed prosecutors “not to\nissue victim notification leters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time\nto review these options with your client.” In the leter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that\nVillafafia had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary\ndamages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during\nthe investigation phase of this mater.”\n\nOn December 5, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz sent a leter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman\nand Assistant Atorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with\n3l2 On November 28, 2oo7, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafafia that\nonly l5 of the then-knoun victims had received victim notification leters from either the FBI or the USAO. On\nDecember 6, 2oo7, the lead case agent reported to Villafafia that she was “still holding many of the original V/W\nleters addressed to victims from the USAO.”\n\nSis Villafafia understood the state prosecutors had set the December l4, 2oo7 date, and emailed them for\nconfirmation, stating, “[I]f the mater is set for the l4th, please let me knou so I can include that in my victim\nnotifications.”\n2l3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4537", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004538.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 24l of 349\nthe USAO’s interpretation of the agreement and “the use of Section 2255.” The Starr and\nLefkouitz leter asserted it was “wholly inappropriate” for the USAO to send the proposed victim\nnotification leter “under any circumstances,” and “strongly urg[ed]” Acosta to withhold the\nnotification leter until after the defense was able “to discuss this mater with Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Fisher.”\n\nThe follouing day, Sloman sent a leter to Lefkouitz, with copies to Acosta and Villafafia,\nasserting that the VRRA obligated the government to notify victims of the l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nproceedings as “other relief” to which they were entitled. Sloman also stated that the VRRA\nobligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning restitution to which\nthey may be entitled and “the earliest possible’ notice of the status of the investigation, the filing\nof charges, and the acceptance of a plea.?'* (Emphasis in original). Sloman added:\n\nJust as in l8 U.S.C. § 377l [the CVRA], these sections are not\n\nlimited to proceedings in a federal district court. Our Non-\n\nProsecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by\n\nallouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense. The victims\n\nidentified through the federal investigation should be appropriately\n\ninformed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.*!°\nSloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafafia or the\nFBI case agent with questions or concerns: “Again, federal law requires that victims have the\n‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’” Sloman advised\nthe defense: “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed\nto Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation. Those questions are appropriately directed to\nlaw enforcement.”\n\nAlong with this leter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkouitz for comment a revised draft victim\nnotification leter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense. The\nleter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been completed,” Epstein would\nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of imprisonment at sentencing,\nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The\nleter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing:\n\nAs I mentioned above, as part of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal\n\ninvestigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.\n\nMr. Epstein’s change of plea and sentencing will occur on\n\nDecember l4, 2oo7, at ___—a.m., before Judge Sandra K. McSorley,\n3l4 See 42 U.S.C. § lo6o7(c)(l)(B) and (c)(3).\n3l5 Emphasis in original. Sloman also stated that the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is\nsimply informing the victims of their rights.” Villafafia informed OPR that Sloman approved and signed the leter,\nbut she was the primary author of the document. OPR notes that Villafafia was the principal author of most\ncorrespondence in the Epstein case, and that follouing the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the leter went\nout with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three atorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence\nbefore a final version was sent to the defense.\n\n2l4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4538", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004540.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 243 of 349\nher a victim for purposes of the federal charges, and continued to treat her as a victim because she\nwanted “to go above and beyond in terms of caring for the victims.”?\"®\n\nE. December l9, 2oo7: Acosta Advises the Defense That the USAO Will Defer to\n\nthe State Atorney the Decision Whether to Notify Victims of the State Plea\nHearing, but the USAO Would Notify Them of the Federal <span class=\"highlight\">Resolution</span>, “as\nRequired by Law”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo7, Starr transmited to Acosta two lengthy submissions authored by\nLefkouitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to “the background and conduct of\nthe investigation” into Epstein. Regarding issues relevant to victim notification, in his transmital\nleter, Starr asserted that the “latest episodes involving [§] 2255 notification to the alleged victims\nput illustratively in bold relief our concerns that the ends of justice, time and time again, are not\nbeing served.” By way of example, Starr complained the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it\nwas clear from the girl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a\nvictim.”\n\nIn his submissions, Lefkouitz argued that the government was not required to notify\nvictims of the § 2255 provision:\n\nVillafafia’s decision to utilize a civil remedy statute in the place of\na restitution fund for the alleged victims eliminates the notification\nrequirement under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4, a federal law that\nrequires federal authorities to notify victims as to any available\nrestitution, not of any potential civil remedies. Despite this fact,\n[she] proposed a Victims Notification leter to be sent to the alleged\nfederal victims.\n\nLefkouitz also argued that a victim trust fund would provide a more appropriate\nmechanism for compensating the victims than the government’s proposed use of l8 U.S.C. § 2255,\nand a trust fund would not violate Epstein’s due process rights. Lefkouitz took issue with the\ngovernment’s “assertion” that the USAO was obligated to send a victim notification leter to the\nalleged victims, or even that it was appropriate for the USAO to do so. Lefkouitz further argued\nthat the government misinterpreted both the CVRA and the VRRA, because neither applied to a\npublic, state court proceeding involving the entry of a plea on state charges.\n\nIn a leter from Villafafia to Lefkouitz, responding to his allegations that she had\ncommited misconduct, she specifically addressed the “false” allegations that the government had\n3l8 As noted previously, in April 2oo7, this victim gave a video-recorded interview to the FBI that was favorable\nto Epstein. Villafafia told OPR she was instructed by either Sloman or Acosta “not to consider [this individual] as a\nvictim for purposes of the NPA because she was not someone whom the Office was prepare[d] to include in” a federal\ncharging document. Accordingly, the victim who became “Jane Doe #2” was not included on the victim list ultimately\nfurnished to the defense. The atorney who was representing this victim at the time of her FBI interview was paid by\nEpstein, and she subsequently obtained different counsel.\n\n2l6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo454o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004542.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 245 of 349\nreview the appropriateness of the potential federal charges and the government’s “unprecedentedly\nexpansive interpretation” of l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn a December l9, 2oo7 response to the defense team, Acosta offered to revise two\nparagraphs in the NPA to resolve “disagreements” with the defense and to clarify that the parties\nintended Epstein’s § 2255 liability to “place these identified victims in the same position as they\nwould have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.” Acosta also advised\nthat although the USAO intended to notify the victims of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal investigation,\nthe USAO would leave to the State Atorney the decision whether to notify victims about the state\nproceedings:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court sentencing\nhearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim notification leter and\nthe statute. I would note that the United States provided the draft\nleter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition, First Assistant United\nStates Atorney Sloman already incorporated in the leter several\nedits that had been requested by defense counsel. I agree that [the\nCVRA] applies to notice of proceedings and results of investigations\nof federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We intend to provide\nvictims with notice of the federal <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, as required by law. We\nwill defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding whether\nhe wishes to provide victims with notice of the state proceedings,\nalthough we will provide him with the information necessary to do\nso if he wishes.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this leter without running it by [Sloman], if\nnot other individuals in the office,” and records shou he sent a draft to Sloman and Villafafia.\nAcosta explained to OPR that he was not concerned about deferring to Krischer on the issue of\nwhether to notify the victims of the state proceedings because he did not view it as his role, or the\nrole of the USAO, “to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to the state\noutcome.”*” Acosta further explained to OPR that despite the USAO’s initial concerns about the\nState Atorney’s Office’s handling of the Epstein case, he did not believe it was appropriate to\nquestion that office’s ability to “fulfill whatever obligation they have,” and he added, “Let’s not\nassume .. . that the State Atorney’s Office is full of bad actors.” Acosta told OPR that it was his\nunderstanding “that the victims would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have\nan opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.” Acosta also told OPR that the state would\n322 Sloman’s handwriten notes from a December 2l, 2oo7 telephone conference indicate that Acosta asked the\ndefense, “Are there concerns re: 377l lang[uage],” to which Lefkouitz replied, “The state should have their oun\nmechanism.” At the time of the Epstein mater, under the Florida Constitution, upon request, victims were afforded\nthe “right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of, and to be present at” a defendant’s plea and sentencing.

Villafafia removed some victims knoun to Epstein from the PBPD investigation\nand others subject to impeachment as a result of civil suits they filed against Epstein, added newly\ndiscovered victims, and made changes to the proposed indictment.\n\nWhile the defense appealed the USAO’s decision to prosecute Epstein to higher levels of\nthe Department, Villafafia sought help for victims whom defense investigators were harassing and\natempting to subpoena for depositions as part of Epstein’s defense in civil lawsuits that some\nvictims had brought against him, as well as purportedly in connection with the state criminal case.\nVillafafia reported to her supervisors that she was able to locate a “national crime victims service\norganization” to provide atorneys for the victims, and the FBI Victim Specialist contacted some\nvictims to provide contact information for the atorneys.*4! During this period, an atorney from\nthe victims service organization was able to help Courtney Wild avoid an improper deposition.\nVillafafia also informed her supervisors, including Sloman, that “one of the victims tried to commit\nsuicide last week,” and advocated aggressively for a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> to the case: “I just can’t stress\nenough hou important it is for these girls to have a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> in this case.

Villafafia did not recall being “asked [to] provide a list of all our victims to the\nState Atorney’s Office.”\n\nIn his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter stated that Villafafia sent him a leter “around the time of\nsentencing,” listing the victims in the federal investigation, and that she asked him to destroy the\nleter after he reviewed it. Reiter recalled that he requested the list because he was aware that the\nstate grand jury’s indictment of Epstein did not include all of the victims that the PBPD had\nidentified and he “wanted to make sure that some prosecution body had considered all of our\nvictims.”°>?\n\nIn her 2ol7 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the PBPD\n“atempted to notify the victims about [the June 3o] hearing in the short time available to us.”°\"4\nIn her 2oo8 declaration, houever, Villafafia conceded that “all knoun victims were not notified.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that Edwards was the only victim atorney she was authorized to\ncontact—she thought probably by Sloman—about the June 3o, 2oo8 plea hearing because Edwards\n“had expressed a specific interest in the outcome.” Villafafia recalled, “I was told that I could\ninform [Edwards] of [the plea date], but I still couldn’t inform him of the NPA.”**° In her 2oo8\ndeclaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she called Edwards and informed him of\nthe plea hearing scheduled for Monday; Villafafia stated that Edwards told her that he could not\natend the hearing but “someone” would be present. In a later filing in the CVRA litigation,\nhouever, Edwards asserted that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading guilty to state\nsolicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edwards’ clients nor any of\nthe federally-identified victims.”*°° Edwards further claimed that because Villafafia failed to\ninform him that the “guilty pleas in state court would bring an end to the possibility of federal\nprosecution pursuant to the plea agreement,” his clients did not atend the hearing.

Acosta told OPR that he\nbelieved the state would notify the victims of the “all-encompassing plea” resolving the federal\ncase “and [the victims would] have an opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\nNevertheless, Acosta did not knou whether the state victims overlapped with the federal victims\nor whether the USAO “shared that list with them.” Villafafia told OPR that she and Acosta\n“understood that the state would notify the state victims” but that neither of them were aware “that\nthe state only believed they had one victim.”*°® Villafafia told OPR that there was “very litle”\ncommunication between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, and although she discussed a\nfactual proffer with the State Atorney’s Office and “the fact that . . . the federal investigation had\nidentified additional victims,” she did not recall discussing “who the specific people were that they\nconsidered victims in the state case.”*°?\n\nSloman told OPR that the “public perception . . . that we tried to hide the fact of the results\nof this <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> from the victims” was incorrect.

July 7, 2oo8: The CVRA Litigation Is Initiated\n\nOn July 3, 2oo8, victims’ atorney Edwards spoke to Villafafia by telephone about the\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the state case against Epstein “and the next stage of the federal prosecution.”°°7 In\nhis 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, Edwards asserted that during this conversation,\nVillafafia did not inform him of the NPA, but that during the call, he sensed that the USAO “was\nbeginning to negotiate with Epstein concerning the federally identified crimes.” Houever, in an\nemail Villafafia sent after the call, she informed Sloman that during the call, Edwards stated that\n“his clients can name many more victims and wanted to knou if we can get out of the deal.”\nVillafafia told Sloman that after she told Edwards that the government was bound by the\nagreement, assuming Epstein completed it, Edwards asked that “if there is the slightest bit of\nhesitation on Epstein’s part of completing his performance, that he and his [three] clients be\nalloued to consult with [the USAO] before making a decision.”*°°\n\nThat same day, Edwards wrote a leter to Villafafia, complaining that Epstein’s state court\nsentence was “grossly inadequate for a predator of this magnitude” and urged Villafafia to “move\nforward with the traditional indictments and criminal prosecution commensurate with the crimes\nMr. Epstein has commited.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, Edwards filed his emergency petition in the U.S. District Court for the\nSouthern District of Florida on behalf of Courtney Wild, who was then identified only as “Jane\nDoe.” She was soon joined by a second petitioner, and they were respectively referred to as “Jane\nDoe l” and “Jane Doe 2.”3°? Edwards claimed that the government had violated his clients’ rights\nunder the CVRA by negotiating to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein without consulting\nwith the victims.

July — August 2oo8: The FBI Sends the Victim Notification Leter to Victims\n\nResiding Outside of the United States\n\nWhile atempting to locate and contact the unrepresented victims, the FBI obtained contact\ninformation for two victims residing outside of the United States.

Villafafia also raised\nwith Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors the question whether the USAO had developed sufficient evidence to\ninclude new victims it had identified since creation of the July 2oo8 list and whether Jane Doe #2, who had previously\ngiven a statement in support of Epstein, should be added back to the list. Ultimately, Villafafia sent the defense a\nleter confirming that the government’s July lo, 2oo8 victim list was “the final list.”\n\n238\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4562", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004567.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 27o of 349\nleters to victims sent after the NPA was signed were not misleading in stating that the mater was\n“under investigation” because the government continued to investigate given its uncertainty that\nEpstein would plead guilty; and (3) Villafafia contacted the petitioners’ atorney prior to Epstein’s\nstate plea to advise him of the hearing. Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR that, while there were\nvalid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is\na case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required. I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [victim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key conclusion that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> after development of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\nintention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\nconcluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*°°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, “[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 Guidelines for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]uidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4567", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004581.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 284 of 349\nand consider victims’ views about, prospective plea negotiations.*’?

In a November 2l, 2ol9 leter to Atorney General William Barr, a Congressional\nRepresentative stated that she had recently introduced legislation specifically to “[c]larify that\nvictims of federal crimes have the right to confer with the Government and be informed about key\npre-charging developments in a case, such as . . . non-prosecution agreements.”*°? The CVRA\nlitigation arising from the Epstein case shous the lack of clarity regarding when CVRA rights\napply: the district court concluded that CVRA rights applied pre-charge, but a sharply divided\npanel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals came to a contrary conclusion, a decision that has\nnou been vacated while the entire court hears the case en banc.\n\nBecause the Supreme Court had not addressed the issue of when CVRA rights apply, the\nlouer courts had reached divergent conclusions, and the Department had concluded that CVRA\nrights did not apply pre-charge, OPR concludes that the subjects’ failure to consult with victims\nbefore signing the NPA did not constitute professional misconduct because at that time, the CVRA\ndid not clearly and unambiguously require prosecutors to consult with victims before the filing of\nfederal criminal charges.*\n\n398 2oo5 Guidelines, Art.

In a\nSeptember 6, 2oo7 email primarily addressing other topics, as the plea negotiations were beginning\nin earnest and almost three weeks before the NPA was signed, Villafafia raised the topic of victim\nconsultation with Sloman: “The agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their\napproval, which as [CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law. . . .\n[A]nd the [PBPD] Chief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.’4\nSloman forwarded the email to Acosta with a note stating, “fyi.” Villafafia recalled that after she\nsent the email, Sloman told her by telephone, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.”*°° Villafafia also told\nOPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve been advised that . . . pre-\ncharge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Villafafia also recalled a discussion with\nAcosta, Menchel, and Sloman, during which she stated that she would need to get victims’ input\non the terms being proposed to the defense, and she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential.\nYou can’t disclose them.’4°°\n\nNone of the other subjects recalled a specific discussion before the NPA was signed about\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations. Menchel told OPR he believed the USAO was not required to\nconsult with victims during the preliminary “general discussion” phase of setlement negotiations;\nmoreover, he left the USAO before the terms of the NPA were fully developed.\n\nSloman told OPR that he “did not think that we had to consult with victims prior to entering\ninto the NPA” and “we did not have to seek approval from victims to resolve a case.” Sloman\nbelieved the USAO was obligated only to notify victims about <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of “the cases that we\nhandled, filed cases.” Sloman recalled that because the USAO envisioned a state court <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>\nof the mater, he did not “think that that was a concern of ours at the time to consult with [the\nvictims] prior to entering into... the NPA.”\n\nLourie told OPR that he did not recall any discussions about informing the victims about\nthe terms of the NPA or any instructions to Villafafia that she not discuss the NPA with the victims.\nHe stated that everything the USAO did was “to try and get the best result as possible for the\nvictims. . . .

[I]f you\nlook at each tree and say, well, you didn’t do this right for the victim, you didn’t tell the victim\nthis and that, you’re missing the big picture.”\nae As noted, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not require consultation with victims\nbecause no criminal charges had been filed. In addition, Villafafia’s reference to victim “approval” was inaccurate\nbecause the CVRA, even when applicable, requires only “consultation” with victims about prosecutorial decisions.\n‘o5 Villafaia did not recall Sloman explaining the reason for the decision.\n\n4o6 Villafafia also told OPR that she recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations\ncould cause victims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.” Villafafia was\nuncertain of the date of the conversation, but Menchel’s presence requires it to have occurred before August 3, 2oo7.\n259\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4583", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004585.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 288 of 349\nrequire victim approval of the prosecutors’ plans, but it allous victims the opportunity to express\ntheir views and to be heard before a final decision is made.

LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\n\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*°”\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim Specialist. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\n4o8 Villafaia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\nGuidelines, Art. IV, § B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners.

ACOSTA’S DECISION TO DEFER TO THE STATE ATTORNEY’S\n\nDISCRETION WHETHER TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT EPSTEIN’S STATE\n\nCOURT PLEA HEARING DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR OR UNAMBIGUOUS\n\nSTANDARD; HOWEVER, ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY\n\nFAILING TO ENSURE THAT VICTIMS IDENTIFIED IN THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION WERE ADVISED OF THE STATE PLEA HEARING\n\nAs set forth in the factual discussion, within a few weeks of the NPA’s signing, it became\nclear that the defense team disagreed with, and strongly objected to, the government’s plan to\ninform victims of their ability to recover monetary damages from Epstein, under the l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 provision of the NPA, and about Epstein’s state court plea hearing. The USAO initially\ntook the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA,\nincluding the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that\nvictims who wanted to atend could do so.\n\nIn November and December 2oo7, Epstein’s atorneys challenged the USAO’s position\nregarding victim notification. Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim\nnotifications. Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected\nto defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing\npursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights requirements. Acosta also determined that the USAO\nwould notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255,\na decision that was implemented by leters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.\nThis decision, which postponed notification of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas,\nwas based, at least in part, on Villafafia’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to\npreserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, belou.\n\nIn this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the responsibility for\nnotifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing. OPR concludes that neither the CVRA\nnor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore\nAcosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the discretion of the State\nAtorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing. Houever, OPR\nalso concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state\nintended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims\nforthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department. Through counsel, Acosta\n“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s conclusion and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard\n“never before expected of any U.S. Atorney.” OPR addresses Acosta’s criticisms in the\ndiscussion belou.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Defer to the State Atorney’s Discretion Whether to\n\nNotify Victims about Epstein’s State Court Plea Hearing Did Not Violate Any\nClear or Unambiguous Standard\n\nIn November 2oo7, Villafafia sought to avoid defense accusations of misconduct\nconcerming her interactions with the victims by preparing a writen notice to victims informing\nthem of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal case and of their eligibility for monetary damages, and inviting\nthem to appear at the state plea hearing. Villafafia and Sloman exchanged edits of the draft leter\nand, at Sloman’s instruction, she provided the draft to defense atorney Lefkouitz, who, in turn,\n\n265\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4589", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004591.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 294 of 349\n\nThereafter, in his December l9, 2oo7 leter to defense counsel mainly addressing other\nmaters, Acosta informed the defense that the USAO would defer to the State Atorney’s discretion\nthe responsibility for notifying victims about Epstein’s state plea hearing:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court [plea and]\nsentencing hearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim\nnotification leter and the statute. I would note that the United States\nprovided the draft leter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition,\nFirst Assistant United States Atorney Sloman already incorporated\nin the leter several edits that had been requested by defense counsel.\nI agree that Section 377l applies to notice of proceedings and results\nof investigations of federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We\nintend to provide victims with notice of the federal <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, as\nrequired by law. We will defer to the discretion of the State Atorney\nregarding whether he wishes to provide victims with notice of the\nstate proceedings, although we will provide him with the\ninformation necessary to do so if he wishes.\n(Emphasis added.)\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this [leter] without running it by [Sloman],\nif not other individuals in the office.” Acosta explained that it was “not for me to direct the State\nAtorney, or for our office to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to\nthe state outcome.” Acosta acknouledged that the USAO initially had concerns about the state’s\nhandling of the case, but he told OPR, “that doesn’t mean that they will not fulfill whatever\nobligation they have. Let’s not assume. . . that the State Atorney’s office is full of bad actors.”\nSloman initially believed that “the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially\nbecause they had restitution rights under [§] 2255”; but his expectations changed after “there was\nan agreement made that we were going to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to\ndecide hou the victims were going to be notified.”*!7 Sloman told OPR he had been “proceeding\nunder the belief that we were going to notify the victims,” even though “this was not a federal\ncase,” but once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO “had concerns that if\nwe g[a]ve them the victim notification leter .. . and the deal fell apart, then the victims would be\ninstantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary compensation.”\n\nOPR could not determine whether the State Atorney’s Office notified any victims in\nadvance of the June 3o, 2oo8 state plea hearing. Krischer told OPR that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad a robust and effective victim notification process and staff, but he was not aware of whether\nor hou it was used in the Epstein case. Belohlavek told OPR that she could not recall whether\nvictims were notified of the hearing nor whether the state law required notification for the\naly Sloman stated in his June 3, 2oo8 leter to Deputy Atorney General Filip that Acosta made the decision\ntogether with the Department’s Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker. Acosta did consult\nwith Mandelker about the § 2255 civil damages recovery process, but neither Acosta nor Mandelker recalled\ndiscussing the issue of victim notification, and OPR found no other documentation indicating that Mandelker played\na role in the deferral decision.\n\n267\nDOJ-OGR-oooo459l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004592.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 295 of 349\nparticular charges and victims at issue. Once the hearing was scheduled, Sloman told Villafafia to\ncontact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2oo8, she reported back\nto Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”*!® Villafafia recalled that she\nsent Reiter a list of the girls identified as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said\nhe would “contact as many as he could.” The contemporaneous records do not shou hou many\nor which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom. No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials. At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding. Accordingly, Villafafia, who was present in the courtroom for the\nhearing, had no knouledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims\nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.””*!”\n\nOPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Atorney’s Office the\ndecision to notify victims of the scheduled date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional\nmisconduct. OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*” Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(2)).7!\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*””\n\n4l8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n4l9 Plea Hearing Transcript at 42.\n42o) OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v.

This\ncontrast added to the victims’ perception that they had been treated unfairly, a view shared by the\npublic.\n\nNothing in the documentary record suggests that Acosta thought through the issue of\ndetermining which victims would be notified by the state, or that he took any steps to ensure that\nall of the knoun federal victims received information about the state plea hearing. Instead, as with\nhis decision to resolve the federal investigation through a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, Acosta exercised\npoor judgment when he made critical decisions affecting the federal investigation and the victims,\nbut also failed to consider the full consequences of those decisions or what was needed to\nimplement them. Acosta’s failure to consider these issues before simply leaving the responsibility\nfor making notifications entirely to the State Atorney’s discretion reflected poorly on the USAO\nand the Department as a whole. It left victims in the dark about an important proceeding that\nresolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had communicated with\nvictims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the Department intentionally\nsought to silence the victims by keeping them uninformed about the NPA and the resulting state\nproceeding. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were afforded an opportunity to atend a hearing\nthat was related to their oun cases and thus failed to ensure that victims were treated with\nforthrightness and dignity.\n\nV. VILLAFANA DID NOT COMMIT PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT IN HER\nORAL COMMUNICATIONS TO VICTIMS AND VICTIMS’ ATTORNEYS, IN\nWHICH SHE DESCRIBED THE CASE AS “UNDER INVESTIGATION” BUT DID\nNOT DISCLOSE THE EXISTENCE OF THE NPA TO SOME VICTIMS\nFrom September 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, until after Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\n\nstate court plea, the case agents, acting under Villafafia’s direction, directly informed only three\n\nvictims that the government had signed an NPA and that, if Epstein complied with its terms, the\nfederal investigation would be closed. During this time period, Villafafia and the case agents\ninteracted with several victims and their atorneys, and Villafafia contacted victims’ atorney\n\nBradley Edwards to encourage him to atend the state court plea hearing, but she did not inform\n\nvictims or Edwards of the NPA or the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal investigation.\n\nAs described in Part One of this chapter, after the NPA was signed, the FBI case agent and\nco-case agent began notifying victims about the NPA.*°° After speaking to three victims, houever,\nthe FBI case agent became concerned that informing the victims about the NPA and the monetary\ndamages provision would create potential impeachment material for the victims and the agent\nshould Epstein breach the NPA and the case proceed to indictment and trial. As the case agent\ntold OPR, “I would . . . have to testify that I told every one of these girls that they could sue\nMr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think it was right.” The case\n43o Although Wild disputed that she was informed of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal case, the case agent’s email to\nVillafafia from this time period reflects that at least one victim understood that the federal case was resolved and that\nshe was unhappy with the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>.\n\n273\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4597", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004598.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3ol of 349\nagent and Villafafia consulted with the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer about the\nmater, and thereafter stopped notifying the victims about the NPA and their ability to pursue\nmonetary damages according to its terms.\n\nVillafafia advised Sloman by email of her concerns regarding the potential impeachment\nevidence, telling him, “One thing I am concerned about is that, if we [file charges] nou, cross-\nexamination will consist of- ‘and the government told you that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are\nentitled to a large amount of damages right?’” Explaining the decision in her later CVRA\ndeclaration, Villafafia said that after Epstein’s atorneys “complained that the victims were\nreceiving an incentive to overstate their involvement with Mr. Epstein in order to increase their\ndamages claims,” she “concluded that informing additional victims could compromise the\nwitnesses’ credibility at trial if Epstein reneged on the agreement.” Acosta was aware of these\nconcerns as he referred to them in an August 2oo8 email, “[W]e also believed that contacting the\nvictims would compromise them as potential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they\nwere doing this for the money, and we did not want to discuss liability with them, which was [a]\nkey part of [the] agree[ment].”\n\nThe case agents interviewed victims in October and November 2oo7, but did not inform\nthem about the NPA.**! On January 3l, 2oo8, the FBI agents, Villafafia, and the CEOS Trial\nAtorney interviewed three victims, including Courtney Wild, and they interviewed at least one\nmore victim the next day.°? Wild and two others had been contacted by the FBI in the fall of\n2oo7 and may have been informed about the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal investigation.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that during the January 3l, 2oo8 interviews, she did not specifically\ntell the victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had these terms.” She\nstated that she would not use “terminology” such as “NPA” because “most people don’t understand\nwhat that means.” Instead, with respect to the three victims who, according to Villafafia, had been\ninformed by the FBI about the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, she stated that “can agreement had been reached where\n[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look [like] he intends to actually\nperform . . . [and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged . . . and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled telling some victims that Epstein “was supposed to enter a plea in state court”\nthat would end the investigation, but she did not recall distinguishing between the “federal\ninvestigation versus a state investigation.” Villafafia told OPR she explained “the case was under\ninvestigation,” she and the agents “were preparing . . . again” to file charges, and they hoped “that\ncharges would be brought.” An email from Villafafia to Sloman and Acosta during this time period\nreflects that she had such discussions with at least one victim interviewed on this date: “The\nsecond girl... was very upset about the l8 month deal she had read about in the paper... .\n[S]he would rather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time in jail.” Villafafia,\nhouever, did not recall telling all of the victims interviewed at this time of the state plea; rather,\nshe likely only told those who knew about the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> from the FBI. In her oun 2ol5 CVRA-\ncase declaration, Wild stated that she “was not told about any [NPA] or any potential <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of\nwl FBI agents also interviewed victims in March and May of 2oo8, without prosecutors, and did not inform the\nvictims of the NPA.\na2 Two additional victims were scheduled to be interviewed on February l, 2oo8, but the evidence is unclear as\nto whether the interviews occurred.\n\n274\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4598", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004603.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o6 of 349\nand they often cannot fully reveal either the facts or the status of an investigation, even with\nvictims. The 2oo5 Guidelines advise that in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited\nin their disclosures: “Because victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government,\nand may disclose whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only nonsensitive data and\npublic information.”*°\n\nVillafafia’s concern about generating potential impeachment evidence by informing\nvictims of their potential to recover monetary damages from Epstein was not unreasonable.\nIndeed, the case agents initially raised the impeachment issue, and after considering the problem,\nVillafafia agreed with the agents’ concerns. Villafafia raised those concerns with the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer in October 2oo7 after the agents brought the issue to her\natention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom\nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound. OPR also considered that although\nVillafafia had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her\nsupervisor, the U.S. Atorney, had decided otherwise. When authorized to inform Edwards of the\nscheduled change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) atendance at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).*4 Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential conclusion of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\nHe 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV, J B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim notification leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\n\n“44 The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of a sex abuse case. Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004604.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o7 of 349\nintentionally concealing information from them and was part of a series of interactions with\nvictims that led to condemnation of the government’s treatment of victims. **°\nVI. THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO TREAT VICTIMS FORTHRIGHTLY AND\n\nWITH SENSITIVITY WHEN IT FAILED TO TIMELY PROVIDE VICTIMS\n\nWITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE <span class=\"highlight\">RESOLUTION</span> OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAlthough OPR does not conclude that any of the subjects commited professional\nmisconduct, either by failing to consult with the victims before the NPA was signed or in\ninteractions afterwards, OPR’s findings are not an endorsement of the government’s course of\naction. The government’s interactions with victims confused and frustrated many of the victims,\nparticularly the two CVRA petitioners and the two victims who had unsuccessfully atempted to\njoin in the CVRA litigation. As a result, the victims’ and the public’s perception of the mater is\nthat the prosecutors worked with Epstein’s atorneys to disenfranchise and silence the victims. It\nis unfortunate, and appears fundamentally unfair to the victims, that Acosta and Sloman (after\nMenchel and Lourie departed) took the unusual step of deciding to vet the USAO victim\nnotification leters with the defense after the NPA was signed, but failed to go beyond the\nrequirements of the CVRA or the 2oo5 Guidelines to consult with the victims before the NPA was\nsigned. This result is contrary to the Department’s intent, as set forth in the 2oo5 Guidelines, that\nDepartment employees work to “minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of crime\nendure in its wake.” When considering the entirety of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by\nthe Department.\n\nWild’s criticisms of the government’s conduct were based on interactions that are similar\nto and generally representative of the government’s interactions with other Epstein victims and\nthat demonstrate an overall lack of sensitivity to the victims by the government. Wild experienced\na series of confusing and inconsistent communications in her interactions with Villafafia and the\ncase agents. Wild received Villafafia’s leter in June 2oo7 stating inaccurately that she was a\nfederal victim entitled to CVRA rights. She was interviewed by the FBI in August 2oo7 but was\nnot told that a potential outcome was a state plea. Shortly after the September 24, 2oo7 signing of\nthe NPA, the FBI contacted her to inform her of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal case. Nonetheless,\non January lo, 2oo8, the FBI sent her a victims’ rights leter indicating that the case was under\ninvestigation and that some of her CVRA rights may not apply until after the defendant was\ncharged. On January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia re-interviewed Wild, along with a CEOS atorney and\nthe FBI] agents, and told Wild that the case was under investigation, but did not specifically mention\nthe NPA, although she may have mentioned a possible <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. In mid-June 2oo8, when\nEdwards contacted Villafafia on Wild’s behalf, Villafafia informed him that the case was under\ninvestigation but did not mention the NPA. Just before Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8 state court plea,\n“45 OPR notes that, similar to Villafafia, Sloman interacted with a victim’s atorney during the time period\nbetween the signing of the NPA and Epstein’s state guilty plea. In January 2oo8, Sloman received a telephone call\nfrom his former law partner, who represented one of the victims and who asked Sloman whether the federal\ngovernment could bring charges against Epstein. Sloman, concerned about the potential for conflict of interest\nallegations due to his prior business relations with the atorney, refused to answer any questions regarding Epstein.\nBecause Sloman refused to provide any information, OPR found no basis for finding that Sloman misled the atorney.\n\n28o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004608.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3ll of 349\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004609.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3l2 of 349\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into\nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation\nwithout a federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department\ndid not interpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the\nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before\ncriminal charges were brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation\nwas for the purpose of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series\nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of\nthe government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is\ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims\nof a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\n285\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004700.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-4 Filed o5/25/2l Page4of5\nCase 9:o8-cv-8o736-KAM Documentl4 Entered on FLSD Docket o7/l5/2oo8 Page 3 of 2l\n—_ ae\n| federal _— on May 28, 2oo8.

Atomey Edwards’ other client,\n‘T.M., was represented by counsel and, accordingly, all contact with T.M. was made through\nthat atorney. That atorney was James Eisenberg, and his fees were paid by Jeffrey Epstein,\nthe target of the investigation.’\n5, In the summer of 2oo7, Mr. Epstein and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the\nSouthern District of Florida (“the Office”) entered into negotiations to resolve the\ninvestigation. At that time, Mr. Epstein had been charged by the State of Florida with\nsolicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statutes § 796.o7. Mr. Epstein’s atorneys\nsought a global <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the mater. The United States subsequently agreed to defer\n| federal prosecution in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida, so long as certain basic\ni preconditions were met. One of the key objectives for the Government was to preserve a\nfederal remedy for the young girls whom Epstein had sexually exploited. Thus, one\n| condition of that agreement, notice of which was provided to the victims on July 9, 2oo8, is\n. the follouing:\n| “Any person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an offense\n. enumerated in Title l8, United States Code, Section 2255, will have the same\nrights to proceed under Section 2255 as she would have had, if Mr. Epstein\n| ———\n*The undersigned does not knou when Mr. Edwards began representing T.M. or whether\nT.M. ever formally terminated Mr. Eisenberg’s representation.\noe CONFIDENTIAL\nSDNY_GM_oo33l5l8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo47oo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004701.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-4 Filed o5/25/2l Page5of5\nCase 9:o8-cv-8o736-KAM Documentl4 [Entered on FLSD Docket o7/l5/2oo8 Page 4 of 2l\n—_ —\nhad been tried federally and convicted of an enumerated offense.

As explained above, one of the terms of the agreement deferring prosecution\nto the State of Florida was securing a federal remedy for the victims. In October 2oo7,\n. shortly after the agreement was signed, four victims were contacted and these provisions\nj were discussed, One of those victims was C.W. who at the time was not represented, and she\n: was given notice of the agreement.

Cosby's atorney\nfor the civil proceedings, John Schmit, had learned about the non-prosecution decision\nfrom Cosby’s criminal counsel, Walter Phillips. From the perspective of Cosby’s\natorneys, the district atorney’s decision legally deprived Cosby of any right or ability to\ninvoke the Fifth Amendment. Accordingly, not once during the four depositions did Cosby\ninvoke the Fifth Amendment or even mention it. During one deposition, Atorney Schmit\nadvised Cosby not to answer certain questions pertaining to Constand, but he did not\nspecifically invoke the Fifth Amendment.’ Nor did Cosby claim the protections of the Fifth\nAmendment when asked about other alleged victims of his sexual abuse, presumably\nbecause he believed that he no longer retained that privilege.

The Government’s charging decisions are squarely\nwithin its discretion and not a probative topic on which the jury should speculate, and the\nGovernment has no obligation to use any particular investigative technique. The Court should\nnot permit evidence on these subjects, which would create an irrelevant sideshou that would\nsignificantly delay this trial and confuse the jury. Similarly, the Court should not permit the\ndefense to call FBI case agents in order to introduce evidence about those topics.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo54l5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005426.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 33 of 54\n(see generally Dep’t of Justice, Office of Professional Responsibility Report, Dkt.

The notice is atached as Exhibit A. According to the\nTouhy request, which must summarize the testimony sought, see 28 C.F.R. § l6.23(c), the\ndefendant seeks testimony “concerning the scope, timeline, and <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the investigation, as\nwell as the various investigative steps taken by the agents, including but not limited to testimony\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5426", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005427.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 34 of 54\nabout numerous witness interviews they conducted, physical evidence they reviewed, documents\nthey obtained by subpoena,” and their activities before the grand jury. (Ex. A at l-2).\n\nBut as set forth above, testimony about the “<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>” of a prior investigation is\nirrelevant hearsay that would only serve to confuse the jury. Evidence about the “scope,”\n“timeline,” or “various investigative steps taken by the agents” is similarly irrelevant and\nmisleading. The case agents are not summary witnesses that the defense can use to place before\nthe jury sweeping conclusions about the Florida Investigations or this one.” The bases identified\nfor their testimony are improper, and the Court should preclude them unless the defense\nidentifies a specific, valid purpose for their testimony.\n\nIV. The Court Should Preclude Evidence or Argument About the Government’s\nAlleged Motives for Prosecution\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has claimed that she is being prosecuted as a\nscapegoat because Jeffrey Epstein is dead. (See, e.g., Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. l42, at l (“[T]he\ngovernment has sought to substitute our client for Jeffrey Epstein... .”)). That claim is as false\nas it is offensive. But in any event, the Government’s motives for prosecution are irrelevant to\nthe question of the defendant’s factual guilt that will be before the jury at trial, and any probative\n’ Furthermore, the proffered bases for the case agents’ testimony will likely run afoul of\nnumerous evidentiary rules. The Government’s case agents cannot testify to the substance of\n“numerous witness interviews they conducted” with uncalled witnesses, which is hearsay. The\nagents’ prior testimony before the grand jury is admissible only under the limited principles that\ngovern prior consistent or inconsistent statements. And there is significant risk that case agent\ntestimony will introduce additional evidentiary issues. For instance, questioning the case agents\nabout information their investigations generated about the defendant would likely yield hearsay\nresponses and would open the door to agents offering other information that is inculpatory to the\ndefendant and that the Government would not otherwise offer at trial.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5427", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005449.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o-l Filed lo/29/2l Page2of3\n| COHEN & GRESSER LLP Nea irk IEE\nChristian R.

It will not be confusing or distracting to elicit evidence of hou that investigation\nconcluded, as the government contends. See Mot. at 27. In fact, the opposite is true. Without\nthat evidence, the jury will be left to speculate hou and when the Florida Investigation ended,\nand whether Ms. Maxwell was charged in connection with that investigation. Accordingly,\neliciting evidence of hou the Florida Investigation ended, including who was (and was not)\ncharged in the proposed indictment, and who was (and was not) immunized in the NPA, will be\nnecessary to avoid jury confusion and speculation, as well as prejudice to Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThe government also suggests that introducing the NPA would require an extended “trial\nwithin a trial” concerning the history of its creation, which was the subject of the 29o-page report\nfrom the Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility (the “OPR Report”). Mot.\nat 27-28. Not so. The defense has no interest in probing the minutiae of the circumstances\nsurrounding the creation of the NPA. It seems even less likely that the government would do so,\ngiven that the OPR Report found that the NPA was “flawed” and was extremely critical of hou\nthe U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida, Alexander Acosta, handled the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>\nof the investigation. OPR Report at 284. The risk of delay or juror confusion by puting the\nNPA at issue in the trial is therefore illusory. It should not be excluded under Rule 4o3.7°\n° The NPA is also not hearsay. It is an agreement that has independent legal significance and is a “verbal\nact” “containing legally operative language affecting the rights of the parties” that does not qualify as\nhearsay.

Evidence and Argument About the Scope, Timeline, and Investigative Steps of\nPrior Investigations Is Admissible\n\nThe government’s motion to preclude the defense from eliciting evidence about the\ninvestigative steps taken in the Florida Investigation and the New York Investigation, and the\nduration of those investigations (see Mot. at 29-32), is entirely off base and breathtaking in the\nscope of what it seeks to restrict. It is as if the government will not tolerate any questioning\nabout its investigations at all. That is certainly not the law. For example, the decision to\ninterview a witness is an investigative step. Does the government really mean to suggest that\nquestioning the case agents about who they spoke to and when they spoke to them is irrelevant?\nSimilarly, the decision to issue a subpoena for documents is an investigative step. Does the\ngovernment really mean to suggest that questioning the case agents about which documents they\nsubpoenaed and when they subpoenaed them is irrelevant? Furthermore, the government will\nseek to offer numerous items of evidence collected in both the Florida and New York\nInvestigations. Does the government really mean to suggest that questioning the case agents\nabout when those investigations began and ended is irrelevant? Surely not. Such questions are\nentirely appropriate and will yield relevant, admissible evidence. The government cannot\npossibly try to prevent the defense from asking these types of valid questions or from calling the\ncase agents as witnesses to answer them.\n\nThe government seems to be conflating “investigative steps” with “investigative\ntechniques,” even though the defense’s Touhy leter does not request testimony from the case\nagents about “investigative techniques.” See Mot., Ex. A (requesting testimony “concerning the\nscope, timeline, and <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the investigation, as well as the various investigative steps\ntaken by the agents”).

The defendant\nand Minor Victim-4 met in person and interacted multiple times between 2ool and 2oo4. Minor\nVictim-4 then mentioned the defendant by description or by name in 2oo7, 2oo9, 2o2o, and 2o2l,\nall prior to being shoun the photo book. And the circumstances of the identification were not\nsuggestive. Minor Victim-4 was shoun 2o photos, LT rrrrr—— ee\nee. She was not asked to locate the defendant, or asked whether a particular photo\ndepicted the defendant, but just whether she recognized anyone, although she was told that she\nwas not expected to recognize someone just because their photo was in the book. And, indeed,\nMinor Victim-4 said she did not recognize some photos in the book. Regarding the defendant\nspecifically, Minor Victim-4 carefully considered whether a different photo depicted the person\nshe believed to be the defendant before seeing and selecting a photo of the defendant. This\nprocedure was cautious and not suggestive—much less unduly suggestive.\n\nThe reality is straightforward: Minor Victim-4 knous exactly who the defendant is and\nconfirmed that the person in the photograph was the defendant. In response, the defense argues\nthat the photo “looks like a mug shot” and “is different than the others.” (Def. Mot. 9 at 3). Of\ncourse, as is often the case with photo arrays or photo books, a// of the photos generally resemble\nmug shots, so there is nothing suggestive about the fact that the defendant’s photo does. And it is\nnot in fact different from the others: While the defendant’s photo is louer <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> than some,\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5852", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005902.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 35 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 29l\n\nDespite Ward and Siegert presenting their Pathways Model as a comprehensive theory of\nsexual offending, it still only considers aetiology and no consideration is given to the offence\nprocess. In a comprehensive theory it is necessary to consider the whole journey from initial\nonset to the offence and beyond. In a similar way that the Transtheoretical Model (Prochaska &\nDiClemente, l982) of change considers not only the action stage, where the overt behaviour is\nchanged, but also the precontemplation, contemplation, preparation and maintenance stages, a\ntheory of sexual offending against children needs to consider the whole journey. As\ndemonstrated above, it is necessary that theories of aetiology are coherent with the\nphenomenon they are atempting to explain. While endeavouring to explain sexual offending\nit is important that sexual grooming is also factored into the equation, because it is part of the\nsexual offending phenomenon. Of the above theories, only Finkelhor’s (l984) Pre-condition\nModel has taken this approach.\n\nOffence process\n\nIn addition to the Pre-condition Model (Finkelhor, l984) there is one other model that\nconsiders the offence process of sexual offending. This is the Descriptive Model of the\nOffence Chain (Ward, Louden, Hudson & Marshall, l995). Ward et al.’s model provides a\nmuch more detailed account of the offence process than the Pre-condition Model. While litle\nevidence has been found to support Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model, Ward et al. used a\ngrounded theory approach and developed their model directly from offenders’ experiences.\nThey identified nine stages of the offence chain. Stage one relates to the offender’s\nbackground factors, including their perception of themselves and their life at the beginning\nof the offence chain and whether these factors caused positive or negative affect. Stage two\ndescribes distal planning of access to their victim; this could take the form of implicit, or\nexplicit planning or chance. Contact with the victim takes place in stage three. Stage four\ninvolves cognitive restructuring, which will result in either positive or negative affect. Stage\nfive entails proximal planning, which would either be self-focused, victim-focused or a\nmutual-focus. This leads to stage six and the sexual offence, which is folloued by further\ncognitive restructuring at stage seven. This results in negative or positive evaluation and future\nresolutions regarding continued offending at stage eight.

For example, the defense has notified the\nGovernment that it seeks to call FBI case agents from these investigations to testify “concerning\nthe scope, timeline, and <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the investigation, as well as the various investigative steps\ntaken by the agents, including by not limited to testimony about numerous witness interviews\nthey conducted, physical evidence they reviewed, [and] documents they obtained by subpoena.”\n(See Exhibit A). In their voir dire motion, the defense stated that they expect “Epstein’s arrests\nand prior convictions for sexual misconduct, allegations of his sexual misconduct of minors over\nthe course of two decades, and his untimely death awaiting his federal trial will be front and\ncenter” at this trial. (Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. 342 at 2).\n\nThe Court should preclude any evidence and argument about (l) charging decisions in\ncriminal investigations of Epstein and his co-conspirators, and possible reasons for those\ndecisions, and (2) the investigative steps taken during the current and prior investigations,\nincluding the length of those investigations. The Government’s charging decisions are squarely\nwithin its discretion and not a probative topic on which the jury should speculate, and the\nGovernment has no obligation to use any particular investigative technique. The Court should\nnot permit evidence on these subjects, which would create an irrelevant sideshou that would\nsignificantly delay this trial and confuse the jury. Similarly, the Court should not permit the\ndefense to call FBI case agents in order to introduce evidence about those topics.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6382", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006393.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 33 of 54\n(see generally Dep’t of Justice, Office of Professional Responsibility Report, Dkt. No. 293 Ex. A\nat v-vi), evidence or argument on that point can only distract the jury from its function.\n\nThe defense is free to offer its oun evidence about the victims and instances charged in\nthis case, and it is free to atempt to impeach the Government’s witnesses through legitimate\nevidentiary means. But evidence about unrelated investigative steps and their outcomes would\nonly serve to extend the trial and distract the jury with irrelevant information. This Court should\npreclude such evidence.\n\nC. The Defense Should Not Be Permited to Call Case Agents Without First Proffering\n\na Valid Basis for Their Testimony\n\nAs explained above, the Court should preclude evidence or argument regarding either the\noutcomes of the prior investigations, investigative steps taken during those investigations, the\nlength of those investigations, or the evidence developed during those investigations about\nunrelated events. Nevertheless, it appears the defense intends to call one or more case agents in\norder to elicit such improper testimony. The Court should preclude testimony from case agents\nunless the defense identifies a proper basis for their testimony.\n\nThe Government has received a request from the defense pursuant to United States ex.\nrel. Touhy v. Regan, 34o U.S. 462 (l95l) for the testimony of two FBI case agents from the\nFlorida Investigations and two FBI case agents for the investigation that led to charges in this\nDistrict against Epstein and the defendant. The notice is atached as Exhibit A. According to the\nTouhy request, which must summarize the testimony sought, see 28 C.F.R. § l6.23(c), the\ndefendant seeks testimony “concerning the scope, timeline, and <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the investigation, as\nwell as the various investigative steps taken by the agents, including but not limited to testimony\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6393", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006394.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 34 of 54\nabout numerous witness interviews they conducted, physical evidence they reviewed, documents\nthey obtained by subpoena,” and their activities before the grand jury. (Ex. A at l-2).\n\nBut as set forth above, testimony about the “<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>” of a prior investigation is\nirrelevant hearsay that would only serve to confuse the jury. Evidence about the “scope,”\n“timeline,” or “various investigative steps taken by the agents” is similarly irrelevant and\nmisleading. The case agents are not summary witnesses that the defense can use to place before\nthe jury sweeping conclusions about the Florida Investigations or this one.” The bases identified\nfor their testimony are improper, and the Court should preclude them unless the defense\nidentifies a specific, valid purpose for their testimony.\n\nIV. The Court Should Preclude Evidence or Argument About the Government’s\nAlleged Motives for Prosecution\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has claimed that she is being prosecuted as a\nscapegoat because Jeffrey Epstein is dead. (See, e.g., Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. l42, at l (“[T]he\ngovernment has sought to substitute our client for Jeffrey Epstein... .”)). That claim is as false\nas it is offensive. But in any event, the Government’s motives for prosecution are irrelevant to\nthe question of the defendant’s factual guilt that will be before the jury at trial, and any probative\n’ Furthermore, the proffered bases for the case agents’ testimony will likely run afoul of\nnumerous evidentiary rules. The Government’s case agents cannot testify to the substance of\n“numerous witness interviews they conducted” with uncalled witnesses, which is hearsay. The\nagents’ prior testimony before the grand jury is admissible only under the limited principles that\ngovern prior consistent or inconsistent statements. And there is significant risk that case agent\ntestimony will introduce additional evidentiary issues. For instance, questioning the case agents\nabout information their investigations generated about the defendant would likely yield hearsay\nresponses and would open the door to agents offering other information that is inculpatory to the\ndefendant and that the Government would not otherwise offer at trial.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6394", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006416.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page2of3\n| COHEN & GRESSER LLP Nea irk IEE\nChristian R.

It will not be confusing or distracting to elicit evidence of hou that investigation\nconcluded, as the government contends. See Mot. at 27. In fact, the opposite is true. Without\nthat evidence, the jury will be left to speculate hou and when the Florida Investigation ended,\nand whether Ms. Maxwell was charged in connection with that investigation. Accordingly,\neliciting evidence of hou the Florida Investigation ended, including who was (and was not)\ncharged in the proposed indictment, and who was (and was not) immunized in the NPA, will be\nnecessary to avoid jury confusion and speculation, as well as prejudice to Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThe government also suggests that introducing the NPA would require an extended “trial\nwithin a trial” concerning the history of its creation, which was the subject of the 29o-page report\nfrom the Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility (the “OPR Report”). Mot.\nat 27-28. Not so. The defense has no interest in probing the minutiae of the circumstances\nsurrounding the creation of the NPA. It seems even less likely that the government would do so,\ngiven that the OPR Report found that the NPA was “flawed” and was extremely critical of hou\nthe U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida, Alexander Acosta, handled the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>\nof the investigation. OPR Report at 284. The risk of delay or juror confusion by puting the\nNPA at issue in the trial is therefore illusory. It should not be excluded under Rule 4o3.7°\n° The NPA is also not hearsay. It is an agreement that has independent legal significance and is a “verbal\nact” “containing legally operative language affecting the rights of the parties” that does not qualify as\nhearsay.

Evidence and Argument About the Scope, Timeline, and Investigative Steps of\nPrior Investigations Is Admissible\n\nThe government’s motion to preclude the defense from eliciting evidence about the\ninvestigative steps taken in the Florida Investigation and the New York Investigation, and the\nduration of those investigations (see Mot. at 29-32), is entirely off base and breathtaking in the\nscope of what it seeks to restrict. It is as if the government will not tolerate any questioning\nabout its investigations at all. That is certainly not the law. For example, the decision to\ninterview a witness is an investigative step. Does the government really mean to suggest that\nquestioning the case agents about who they spoke to and when they spoke to them is irrelevant?\nSimilarly, the decision to issue a subpoena for documents is an investigative step. Does the\ngovernment really mean to suggest that questioning the case agents about which documents they\nsubpoenaed and when they subpoenaed them is irrelevant? Furthermore, the government will\nseek to offer numerous items of evidence collected in both the Florida and New York\nInvestigations. Does the government really mean to suggest that questioning the case agents\nabout when those investigations began and ended is irrelevant? Surely not. Such questions are\nentirely appropriate and will yield relevant, admissible evidence. The government cannot\npossibly try to prevent the defense from asking these types of valid questions or from calling the\ncase agents as witnesses to answer them.\n\nThe government seems to be conflating “investigative steps” with “investigative\ntechniques,” even though the defense’s Touhy leter does not request testimony from the case\nagents about “investigative techniques.” See Mot., Ex. A (requesting testimony “concerning the\nscope, timeline, and <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the investigation, as well as the various investigative steps\ntaken by the agents”). The defense is aware of the rule that it may comment on the absence of\nproof in the record, but it is not permited to argue that the government should have used any\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6465", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006777.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 69 of 84\nand the identification is merely confirmatory.” (citation and internal quotation marks omited));\nStallings v.

The defendant\nand Minor Victim-4 met in person and interacted multiple times between 2ool and 2oo4. Minor\nVictim-4 then mentioned the defendant by description or by name in 2oo7, 2oo9, 2o2o, and 2o2l,\nall prior to being shoun the photo book. And the circumstances of the identification were not\nsuggestive. Minor Victim-4 was shoun 2o photos, LT rrrrr—— ee\nee. She was not asked to locate the defendant, or asked whether a particular photo\ndepicted the defendant, but just whether she recognized anyone, although she was told that she\nwas not expected to recognize someone just because their photo was in the book. And, indeed,\nMinor Victim-4 said she did not recognize some photos in the book. Regarding the defendant\nspecifically, Minor Victim-4 carefully considered whether a different photo depicted the person\nshe believed to be the defendant before seeing and selecting a photo of the defendant. This\nprocedure was cautious and not suggestive—much less unduly suggestive.\n\nThe reality is straightforward: Minor Victim-4 knous exactly who the defendant is and\nconfirmed that the person in the photograph was the defendant. In response, the defense argues\nthat the photo “looks like a mug shot” and “is different than the others.” (Def. Mot. 9 at 3). Of\ncourse, as is often the case with photo arrays or photo books, a// of the photos generally resemble\nmug shots, so there is nothing suggestive about the fact that the defendant’s photo does. And it is\nnot in fact different from the others: While the defendant’s photo is louer <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> than some,\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6777", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006827.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 35 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 29l\n\nDespite Ward and Siegert presenting their Pathways Model as a comprehensive theory of\nsexual offending, it still only considers aetiology and no consideration is given to the offence\nprocess. In a comprehensive theory it is necessary to consider the whole journey from initial\nonset to the offence and beyond. In a similar way that the Transtheoretical Model (Prochaska &\nDiClemente, l982) of change considers not only the action stage, where the overt behaviour is\nchanged, but also the precontemplation, contemplation, preparation and maintenance stages, a\ntheory of sexual offending against children needs to consider the whole journey. As\ndemonstrated above, it is necessary that theories of aetiology are coherent with the\nphenomenon they are atempting to explain. While endeavouring to explain sexual offending\nit is important that sexual grooming is also factored into the equation, because it is part of the\nsexual offending phenomenon. Of the above theories, only Finkelhor’s (l984) Pre-condition\nModel has taken this approach.\n\nOffence process\n\nIn addition to the Pre-condition Model (Finkelhor, l984) there is one other model that\nconsiders the offence process of sexual offending. This is the Descriptive Model of the\nOffence Chain (Ward, Louden, Hudson & Marshall, l995). Ward et al.’s model provides a\nmuch more detailed account of the offence process than the Pre-condition Model. While litle\nevidence has been found to support Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model, Ward et al. used a\ngrounded theory approach and developed their model directly from offenders’ experiences.\nThey identified nine stages of the offence chain. Stage one relates to the offender’s\nbackground factors, including their perception of themselves and their life at the beginning\nof the offence chain and whether these factors caused positive or negative affect. Stage two\ndescribes distal planning of access to their victim; this could take the form of implicit, or\nexplicit planning or chance. Contact with the victim takes place in stage three. Stage four\ninvolves cognitive restructuring, which will result in either positive or negative affect. Stage\nfive entails proximal planning, which would either be self-focused, victim-focused or a\nmutual-focus. This leads to stage six and the sexual offence, which is folloued by further\ncognitive restructuring at stage seven. This results in negative or positive evaluation and future\nresolutions regarding continued offending at stage eight. This <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> will be to either avoid\nfuture offending or to persist in an abusive patern. Stage nine depicts the impact of these\nresolutions on the offender’s life.\n\nIt is important to consider hou sexual grooming fits into, and facilitates, the offence\nprocess, as this understanding is likely to aid the management of offenders and potential\noffenders by identifying the offence process prior to an sexual offence taking place.

NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nThe Court is in receipt of the parties’ leters addressing the Defendant’s request to\ntemporarily seal her motion for a new trial and accompanying exhibits, and the Government’s\nresponse in opposition and accompanying exhibits. See Dkt. Nos. 59o, 594, 595. Several media\norganizations have also filed leters seeking unsealing. The Court is also in receipt of Juror 5o’s\nmotion to intervene. Both the Government and the Defendant oppose intervention. The\nDefendant seeks to strike or, in the alternative, seal Juror 5o’s motion.\n\nFor the reasons outlined more fully belou, the Court rules as follous. First, the\nDefendant’s motion to temporarily seal in their entirety all documents related to the motion for a\nnew trial is DENIED. Any sealing of judicial documents must be narrouly tailored to serve\ncompeting interests. In this case, important interests include preserving the integrity of any\ninquiry process going forward as well as protecting juror anonymity and privacy. Protection of\nthese interests, houever, can plainly be accomplished through tailored redactions. Follouing the\nCourt’s <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the Defendant’s motion or a hearing, if one is ordered, all redactions will be\npromptly unsealed except those necessary to protect any continuing interest in juror anonymity\nand privacy.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo89o9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008910.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document596- Filed o2/ll/22 Page2of7\n\nSecond, the Court DENIES Juror 5o’s motion to intervene as it is unnecessary and\nunsupported by any authority or precedent. Juror 5o’s motion to intervene, houever, will be\ndocketed because the Court DENIES the Defendant’s request to seal the motion. Even though\nthe motion to intervene is denied, it is a judicial document to which the presumption in favor of\npublic access applies and no interests are served by maintaining it under seal.\n\nl. Temporary sealing of documents related to the motion for a new trial\n\nThe Court first addresses the Defendant’s request that this Court seal all documents\nrelated to the motion for a new trial either until the motion is resolved or until after a hearing is\nconducted, should one be ordered. Dkt. No. 59o at l-2. The Court considers a request to seal\npursuant to the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). First, the Court determines whether the document in\nquestion is a “judicial document”—that is, a document “relevant to the performance of the\njudicial function and useful in the judicial process.” Jd. at ll9. If so, a presumption of access\nunder the First Amendment and common law ataches. In the second step of the inquiry, the\nCourt determines the weight to be accorded the presumption of access. /d. Finally, “after\ndetermining the weight of the presumption of access, the Court must ‘balance competing\nconsiderations against it,’” such as “the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial\nefficiency” and “the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.” /d. at l2o (quoting United\nStates v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o-5l (2d Cir. l995)).\n\nBoth parties agree that the motion papers are “judicial document[s] that [are] subject to a\nstrong presumption of access under both the First Amendment and common law.” Dkt. No. 594\nat 2 (quoting Dkt. No. 59o at 4). Houever, the Defendant argues that sealing pending a hearing\nor <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> is necessary “to ensure the integrity of any fact-gathering process that may take\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo89lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008912.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document596 Filed o2/ll/22 Page4of7\n\nAccordingly, the Defendant’s motion to keep the papers under seal in their entirety is\ndenied. Instead, the parties must propose narrouly tailored redactions as necessary to serve\nimportant interests. Here those interests are to ensure the integrity of any inquiry going forward\nand to protect juror anonymity and privacy. Those interests justify redaction of the questions the\nparties propose be asked at any hearing. See United States v. McCoy et al., No. l4 Cr. 6l8l\n(EAW), Dkt. No. 3l2 (text order) (W.D.N.Y. May 26, 2ol7) (requiring proposed questions to be\nsubmited directly to the court); see also Dkt. No. 329 at 38-39 (counsel discussing concern that\ndisclosing specific questions ahead of hearing would allou juror to prepare and “rehearse the\nanswers”). And they may justify redaction of any specific factual information developed by the\nparties that has not been publicly reported in the press and that the parties propose be inquired\nabout at any forthcoming hearing. The Court will also permit redactions necessary to ensure\njuror anonymity and privacy. See Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of Cal., Riverside Cnty., 464\nU.S. 5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984). By contrast, there is no basis to redact legal arguments, case citations,\nand analysis regarding the standard by which the parties contend that the Defendant’s motion\nshould be evaluated, as well as legal arguments, case citations, and analysis regarding the proper\nscope of any potential hearing. Nor will the Court permit the redaction of information that is\nwidely reported in the press. Such redactions do not conform with the dictates of Lugosch and\nare not necessary to protect the integrity of any inquiry.\n\nImportantly, follouing the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the Defendant’s motion or a hearing, if\none is ordered, all redactions will be promptly unsealed except those necessary to protect any\ncontinuing interest in juror anonymity and privacy.\n\nThe parties are thus ORDERED to propose narrouly tailored redactions to the Defense\nmotion, the Government’s response in opposition, and the Defense reply, as consistent with this\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo89l2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008948.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 24 of 37\na part and furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, [Ms. Maxwell] and Jeffrey\nEpstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein’s residences in different states,\nwhich [Maxwell] knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual\nabuse.”’).\n\nMs. Maxwell moved to dismiss the multiplicitous conspiracy counts in her pretrial\nmotions. (Dkt. l22, 2lo, 293). The Court, citing the Second Circuit’s holding in United States v.\nJosephburg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir. 2oo6), found that the motion was premature because Ms.\nMaxwell had not been convicted on the conspiracy counts and, hence, was not yet in jeopardy of\nreceiving multiple punishments for the same offense. (Dkt. 2o7 at 27-28; Dkt 3l7 at 9-lo). The\nCourt denied Ms. Maxwell’s motion without prejudice, deferring the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the\nmultiplicity claim until after the conclusion of the trial. Jd.\n\nThe trial is nou over, and Ms. Maxwell was convicted on all three conspiracy counts.\nThe government’s theory of prosecution and the proof elicited at trial were entirely aligned with\nthe allegations in the Indictment — that Ms. Maxwell participated in a single criminal conspiracy\nwith Epstein, which may have evolved slightly over time, but always maintained the same\noverarching objective, the same core participants, and the same method of operation throughout\nthe entire time period in the Indictment. Ms. Maxwell nou faces the prospect of being punished\nmultiple times for the same offense in violation of her rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause.\nAccordingly, we move the Court to impose judgement on only one of the three conspiracy\ncounts.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n“An indictment is multiplicitous when it charges a single offense as an offense multiple\ntimes, in separate counts, when, in law and fact, only one crime has been commited.” United\nStates v.

As such, Juror 5o’s motion to\nintervene and for the release of the sealed Jury Questionnaire and voir dire materials should be\ngranted, as requested herein\nI. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nJuror 5o served on the jury in the case sub judice, which reached a verdict on December\n29, 2o2l. After the verdict was reached Juror 5o gave interviews, which were reported in both\nprint media and televised news reports. In the media reporting on the interviews given by Juror\n5o, he is alleged to have discussed his personal experience(s) with sexual abuse. See Prosecution\nLeter dated Jan. 5, 2o22. ECF # 568.\n\nOn this basis, and on the basis of information filed under seal, Defense Counsel sent a\nleter to Judge Nathan, which was also published in the media, claiming “incontrovertible\ngrounds for a new trial under rule 33”. See Defense Leter dated Jan. 5, 2o22. ECF #569.\n\nThereafter, Judge Nathan issued an order giving Juror 5o the opportunity to determine if\nhe “wishes to be heard on the issue of the appropriateness of an inquiry” and to submit a brief by\nJanuary 26, 2o22, if he determines that he does desire to be heard on such issue. Order at l. Jan.\n5, 2o22. 2o-CR-33o.\n\nJuror 5o seeks a copy of his Jury Questionnaire, as he does not recall answering questions\nregarding his prior experience with sexual assault. Juror 5o indicated the same to the media,\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8984", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008987.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6o9_ Filed o2/24/22 Page8ofl3\nF3d 76, 79 (2d Cir l998) (Citing United States v. King, No. 94 Cr. 455, l998 WL 5o22l\n(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, l998)).\nMoreover, conclusion of the trial on which the subject juror served does not remove a\nJurors’ interest in privacy and protection from harassment. See United States v. Gurney, 558 F.2d\nl2o2, l2lo-l2 (Sth Cir.l977).\nps Jurors may face criminal exposure for answers given on jury\nquestionnaires\nTo complete the jury questionnaire, jurors must swear to truthfully answer the same\nunder penalty of perjury; jurors are also placed under oath prior to answering questions in voir\ndire. See e.g., United States v Parse, 789 F3d 83, 88 (2d Cir 2ol5).

(Dkt.\nNo. 627). The Government strongly opposes defense counsel’s request, as an adjournment—let\nalone a two-month adjournment—s not in the interests of justice. As an initial mater, this case is\nscheduled for sentencing in June and that date should not be delayed. The victims in this case\ndeserve a timely <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of this mater.\n\nNearly one week after the Court issued its Opinion and Order scheduling the March 8, 2o22\nhearing (Dkt. No. 62o), defense counsel filed its adjournment request, citing scheduling conflicts\nof the defendant’s Colorado-based counsel. But the defendant is represented by multiple atorneys,\nat least two of whom are available.! Moreover, because the Court has already ruled that the Court\nwill conduct the questioning of Juror 5o, and because the parties have had an opportunity to submit\nquestions for the Court’s consideration in advance of the hearing (id. at l6-l7), the defendant does\n' Defense counsel’s leter notes that Ms. Sternheim has a trial scheduled to start the follouing\nweek, on March l6, 2o22, but the Government notes that Ms. Sternheim is one of multiple defense\natorneys in that case as well.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo96l9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009620.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 628 Filed o3/o2/22 Page2of2\nPage 2\n\nnot need four atorneys to be present to observe the questioning of Juror 5o and participate in the\nhearing.

Juror No. 5o’s Motion and accompanying\nMemorandum are an atempt to obtain discovery by a non-party to this criminal case,\nmade by someone who lacks standing to participate in this prosecution. Accordingly,\nthese pleadings are not “judicial documents” and are afforded no presumption of public\naccess. United States v. Smith, 985 F.

She is wrong. Juror 5o’s motion to intervene is\nquite obviously “relevant to the performance of a judicial function and useful in the judicial\nprocess.” United States v.

The defendant also cites\ncivil cases involving discussions of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure l2(f) under which “[a] court\nmay strike from a pleading . . . any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous mater.” The\ndefendant ignores that even in that context, “motions to strike are disfavored and should not be\ngranted ‘unless there is a strong reason for so doing.’” Bailey v.

Maxwell was central to operating the scheme and managing employees at\nthese properties. Most importantly, the offense conduct was extensive because so many young\ngirls were sexually exploited as a direct result of the defendant’s conduct. At trial, the evidence\nestablished that Jane, Annie, Kate, Carolyn, Virginia, and Melissa were all exploited as a direct\nresult of the defendant’s actions.\n\nThe trial record also makes clear that there were many other victims who were harmed by\nthis conspiracy. First, Carolyn testified that she brought multiple additional minors, including\nMelissa, to provide paid sexualized massages to Epstein. Although these minors did not\nnecessarily interact directly with Maxwell, they were subjected to sexual abuse as a result of the\npyramid scheme that Maxwell and Epstein set in motion. Carolyn specifically recalled bringing\ngirls named Tatum and Amanda when they were under the age of l8 to provide paid sexualized\nmassages for Epstein. (Tr. l543-44).

I worked for the 9/ll Fund for over ten years before leaving in November 2ol9 to\nserve as Co-Designer and Administrator of the EVCP.\n\n4. Compensation programs like the EVCP and the 9/ll Fund are designed as\nalternative dispute <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> mechanisms through which alleged victims of traumatic events\nhave an opportunity to voluntarily and confidentially resolve related civil tort claims through a\nnon-adversarial administrative process outside of court.\n\n5. Confidentiality is a critical, cornerstone feature in compensation programs like the\nEVCP and the 9/ll Fund. Preserving confidentiality and preventing the disclosure of all\ninformation and/or documentation submited to, maintained by, exchanged with, and distributed\nby these programs in order to protect the privacy of claimants is of paramount importance.\n\n6. Confidentiality is particularly important in the EVCP given that it involves claims\nof sexual abuse and given the history of the Epstein case. In my experience, it can be incredibly\ndifficult for victims of sexual abuse to share such deeply personal, intimate, private information\nabout their experiences and the impact it has had on their lives. To compound that, victims of\nsexual abuse often suffer from a loss of trust and confidence in individuals in positions of\nauthority as well as a fear of exposure. This is especially true of victims of Jeffrey Epstein,\nmany of whom share a common distrust of the justice system and lack of faith in basic principles\nof fairness.\n\n7. Against this backdrop, it is not surprising that many victims were initially\nreluctant to participate in the EVCP — or would have refused to participate — without an express\nassurance of confidentiality. I had countless conversations with victims’ counsel and sexual\nabuse experts when the Program was being designed in which they vigorously expressed this\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooll468", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011469.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-l Filed o7/l5/22 Page3of7\nsentiment, a sentiment that was also conveyed to me personally, repeatedly and pleadingly by the\nvictims themselves.\n\n8. With that confidentiality imperative in mind, we designed the EVCP Protocol\nwith input and support from the victims’ lawyers, the Atorney General of the U.S. Virgin\nIslands, the Epstein Estate and other interested parties. The Protocol was approved by the\nProbate Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands (where Epstein’s estate is being probated); a copy of the\ncourt order is included with this motion as Exhibit G. The Protocol sets out the terms, conditions\nand guiding principles that govern the Program, the claims process and my role and\nresponsibilities as independent Administrator. In accordance with the Protocol, I had complete\nand exclusive autonomy and decision-making authority over all claim determinations and all\nclaim procedures. The Estate agreed to pay whatever amounts I determined in my independent\njudgment to eligible claimants in exchange for the claimant releasing the Estate and other related\nindividuals and entities from any civil claims relating to the allegations of sexual abuse. The\nProtocol, as well as other information about the EVCP, is publicly available on its website at\nhtps://epsteinvep.com/, and the Protocol is atached to the motion as Exhibit D.\n\n9. Confidentiality is an indispensable condition of the EVCP; its importance cannot\nbe overstated. The EVCP Protocol expressly requires confidentiality in order to protect the\nprivacy of claimants. In accordance with the Protocol, information provided to or obtained by\nthe Program was used by me, in my role as Administrator, for the sole purpose of processing and\nevaluating claims and performing other Program-related work (such as <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of any related\nMedicaid and/or Medicare liens). It was otherwise kept - and must remain - confidential. The\nProtocol provides that the Program’s files are not available for inspection or review at any time,\nand that no information obtained solely through the Program will be disclosed publicly or used\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooll469", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011470.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-l Filed o7/l5/22 Page4of7\nby the Estate in defending itself from any claim, regardless of forum. And the Protocol expressly\nauthorizes the destruction of Program files to protect the privacy of claimants participating in the\nProgram.\n\nlo. —_ In addition to the Protocol, I testified in open court in the Probate Court in the\nU.S. Virgin Islands about the confidentiality requirement imposed on the Program, as did\nKenneth R. Feinberg, who was a Co-Designer of the EVCP. A copy of relevant excerpts of the\ntranscript is atached to the motion as Exhibit H, and the relevant testimony appears at pages\nll:l-ll:l6, ll8:9-ll8:24 (my testimony) and pages l7o:25-l7l:25, l8o:23-l82:8 (Mr.\nFeinberg’s testimony). I posted FAQs on the EVCP website that address the scope and\nassurance of confidentiality. A copy of the EVCP FAQs is atached to the motion as Exhibit E\n(see Questions 5, 6 and ll). I also issued several press releases during the claims process that\nhighlight confidentiality as a “cornerstone” of the EVCP and of “paramount importance.”\nCopies of EVCP press releases are atached as Exhibits B, C, and F. Through numerous public\nforums, confidentiality was discussed as a centerpiece of the Program.\n\nll. The express condition of confidentiality significantly informed the way I\nadministered the Program and approached the claims process. I implemented a trauma-informed\nprocess where claimants could share information freely and openly without feeling the need to\ncensor themselves - not only about the events that gave rise to the claim but also the often\nprofound impact on their lives. I spent months building trust and confidence in this alternative\ndispute <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> process among claimants and their atorneys — a process that was new and\nunfamiliar to many of them. I dispensed with formal rules of procedure or evidence that would\napply in a court of law in favor of a less formal, non-adversarial approach. And I implemented\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll47o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011471.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-l Filed o7/l5/22 Page5of7\nextensive measures to safeguard the confidentiality and security of all information submited to,\nmaintained by, exchanged with and distributed by the Program.\n\nl2. With the express assurance of confidentiality, and without the formality of court\nproceedings or fear of exposure and cross examination, victims agreed to participate in the\nProgram, let their guards doun and share exceedingly intimate, private information. Claimants\nrelied upon the express condition and assurances of confidentiality in agreeing to support the\nvery existence of the Program, in deciding to participate in the claims process, and in submiting\ntheir claims and any other information to the EVCP. They were willing to trust this process,\ndespite deep-seated distrust of purported systems of “justice,” because of Program\nconfidentiality.\n\nl3. Compromising confidentiality in any way would eviscerate the very foundation\nand fabric of the EVCP, and would have a disastrous chilling effect on victims who are already\nloath to disclose such personal information. The idea that the information the victims agreed to\ndisclose to the EVCP solely for purposes of evaluation and potential <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the claim\nwould be disclosed to anyone outside the EVCP for any other purpose is anathema to the\nintegrity of this Program and others like it. The Program and Protocol were approved by a court\norder from the Probate Court in the U.S. Virgin Islands and I abided by the terms and guiding\nprinciples of the Protocol in every way and at every step of the process. Failing to abide by any\nterm of the Protocol, much less the keystone condition of confidentiality, is intolerable,\nimpermissible, and would lead to the unraveling of the Program. Allouing any disclosure of any\ndocuments, information and/or communications submited to, maintained by, or exchanged with\nthe EVCP would turn the Program on its head with far-reaching consequences to this victim\npopulation and beyond.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll47l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011474.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-2 Filed o7/l5/22 Pagepk@frbit p\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE November l4, 2ol9\nAdministrator Jordana H.

The Epstein VCP is a voluntary, non-adversarial, confidential claims <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> program\nthat has been established to compensate victims-survivors and resolve their sexual abuse claims\nagainst Jeffrey Epstein and the Epstein Estate. The Epstein VCP will operate entirely independently\nof the Epstein Estate.\nThe Program was designed over the last several months by nationally recognized independent\nclaims administration experts Kenneth R.

When Plaintiff’s counsel\nasked Maxwell’s counsel for information about the criminal investigation during their meet and\nconfer, Maxwell’s counsel refused to provide any details. “A civil defendant urging such a stay\n[pending a parallel criminal prosecution] bears the burden of establishing its need.” Rex & Roberta\nLing Living Tr. v. B Commce’ns Ltd., 346 F. Supp. 3d 389, 4oo (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8) (internal quotation\nmarks omited). Maxwell therefore cannot use the existence of a criminal investigation to dodge\nher discovery obligations in this mater, particularly while at the same time refusing to provide any\ndetails or reasons as to why the investigation is a reason to stay the action under the law of this\nCircuit.\"\n\nSecond, the potential claims <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> program does not justify a stay of discovery. As\nthis Court knous, the program cannot go forward due to the current criminal activity lien on Jeffrey\nEpstein’s Estate in the U.S. Virgin Islands (“USVI”). See Tr. of Feb. ll, 2o2o Conf. at 36:l5-l8\n(“[T]he two cases where discovery has been stayed, in light of what’s happening in the Virgin\nIslands, they may end up unstayed.”). But even if the lien were lifted and the program could go\nforward tomorrou, both Epstein’s Estate (Maxwell’s co-defendant) and this Court have recognized\nthat victims would still not be required to stay discovery in their cases in order to participate in the\nprogram. Tr. of Feb ll, 2o2o Conf. at 6:lo—l8 (Estate explaining that staying litigation is not\nrequired in order to participate in the program); Tr. of Feb ll, 2o2o Conf. at l7:2-3 (Court\nrecognizing that Defendants cannot ask victims to stay their cases in order to participate in the\nprogram); Tr. of Nov. 2l, 2ol9 Conf. at 26:lo—ll (“The default in this Court is that it does not\nstay discovery.”). Accordingly, this Court has not stayed any other action against Jeffrey Epstein’s\nEstate in light of a potential claims administration program unless all the parties agreed to such a\nstay, and there is no reason to treat this case differently merely because Maxwell is named as a\nDefendant in addition to the Estate. Further, this Court has recognized that some discovery might,\nin fact, be necessary to inform the claims <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> program. Tr. of Nov. 2l, 2ol9 Conf. at\n27:8—ll (“[I]t may be that you need discovery in the litigation to have in hand certain discovery\nbefore you can figure out the right setlement for a particular case.”).\n\nMaxwell also contends that if the program moves forward and Plaintiff chooses to\nparticipate, Maxwell will be released from liability for sexually assaulting Plaintiff when she was\na child. But, again, the contours of the program have not been finalized. Even if the program\nmoves forward and even if Plaintiff chooses to participate, it is not clear that Maxwell would be\nreleased for her torts against Plaintiff. In fact, the scope of the release that participants in the\nprogram would be required to sign is the very issue, and the sole issue, that the USVI Atorney\nGeneral and Epstein’s Estate are still negotiating. See Co-Executors’ Corrections to Atorney\nl The pending criminal investigation did not inhibit Maxwell from filing her oun lawsuit\nagainst the Estate for indemnification, even though her criminal conduct would be directly at issue\nin that case, and the case would require discovery concerning such conduct. Maxwell v. Estate of\nJeffrey E. Epstein, et al., ST-2o-CV-l55 (V.I. Super. Ct.); Willie v. Amerada Hess Corp., 66 VI.\n23, 92 (Super.

Judge Schofield’s words at the pre-motion conference—in which she suggested that\nMaxwell’s counsel not file a motion to dismiss—speak for themselves, and demonstrate that\nMaxwell’s motion to dismiss is anything but “strong”: “I’ve reviewed the leter from defendant\nMaxwell’s counsel, and this particular motion doesn’t strike me as any more meritorious” than the\none previously contemplated by the Estate, which eventually filed an Answer in lieu of a motion\nto dismiss after a similar pre-motion conference before Judge Schofield. Tr. of Apr. l6, 2o2o\nConf. at 3:22—24. Further, this Court has explicitly stated that the default in this Court is that\ndispositive motions do not stay discovery, which is also consistent with Judge Schofield’s\nindividual rules. Tr. of Nov. 2l, 2ol9 Conf. at 26:lo—l2; Judge Schofield’s Individual Rule HI.C.2.\n(“Absent extraordinary circumstances, the Court does not stay discovery or any other case\nmanagement deadlines during the pendency of a motion to dismiss.”). Maxwell’s anticipated\nmotion to dismiss should not stay discovery in this mater, just as the Estate’s motions to dismiss\nhave not stayed discovery in any other mater against it in this District.\n\nThe Court should deny Maxwell’s motion for a pre-motion conference, and deny her\nanticipated motion to stay discovery in this mater in its entirety. Nor is full briefing necessary to\naddress the above issues—the anticipated motion to stay borders on frivolous in light of this\nCourt’s clear statements about staying cases against Epstein’s Estate and Judge Schofield’s advice\nto Maxwell to refrain from filing a motion to dismiss. Maxwell has already failed to comply with\nher discovery obligations in this mater, in effect granting herself a de facto stay, and providing for\na full, three-week briefing schedule on her anticipated motion to stay will only give her another\nincentive to continue to delay. Fact discovery in this mater ends in less than two months, and we\nrespectfully submit that her delay tactics should end nou.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n\n/s/ David Boies\n\nDavid Boies, Esq.\ncc: Counsel of Record (via ECF)\n2 Maxwell also argues that the fact that Plaintiffs sister (and a few other victims) have\nvoluntarily stayed their cases in light of a potential claims <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> program warrants a ruling\nthat Plaintiff must stay her case as well. This makes no sense. Plaintiff and her sister filed separate\nactions and are separate litigants.

(See 8/l9/2o Menninger Ltr.) In her\nmotion, Maxwell set out the factors relevant to a stay analysis, and argued that not only her oun\ninterest, but also the interests of the courts, the public, and the other parties would be best served\nby the requested stay. (See generally id.)\n\nOn August 27, 2o2o, the Co-Executors submited a leter consenting to the entry of a stay\nand joining in Maxwell’s request that the stay apply to the entire proceeding. (See Leter to the\nCourt from Bennet J. Moskouitz, Esq., dated Aug. 27, 2o2o (“8/27/2o Moskouitz Ltr.”)\n\n(Dkt. 77).) The Co-Executors principally argued that this Court should not consider a partial stay\nof this case (7.e., a stay that would apply solely as to Plaintiffs claims against Maxwell), as a\npartial stay would unduly prejudice the Co-Executors’ ability to defend against Plaintiff's claims\nand would add unnecessary cost to the litigation. (See id., at l-2.) The Co-Executors also\npointed out that, if this mater were stayed, Plaintiff would still be able to pursue a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of\nher claims through the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Compensation Program’’)\nthat has been independently instituted, and that has led numerous other plaintiffs in similar cases\nbefore the Court to seek voluntary stays of their lawsuits. (See id., at 2-3.)\n\nBy leter dated August 27, 2o2o, Plaintiff vigorously opposed the requested stay, arguing\nthat the relevant factors weigh against granting the requested relief. (See generally Leter to the\nCourt from Robert Glassman, Esq., dated Aug. 27, 2o2o (“8/27/2o Glassman Ltr.”) (Dkt. 78).)\nIn her opposition, Plaintiff contended, inter alia, that Maxwell’s detention should pose no real\nimpediment to her defense of this action, suggesting that Maxwell, who filed her motion for a\nstay only after she had first sought discovery from Plaintiff in this case, “appear[ed] to want to\ngain an unfair advantage by acquiring as much information as she [could] about Plaintiff without\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oool9446", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019447.jpg": "Case C2@-Ao-oo484-DGHUDER ODocemek Go, FICE DLl Hadge4Bayeds of l3\nhaving to divulge anything about herself or the bad conduct she is alleged to have commited.”\n(/d., at l; see also id., at 4-5 (arguing that Maxwell had already demonstrated her ability to\nparticipate actively in this action from jail).) Plaintiff also noted that, under the terms of the\nCompensation Program, she is not required to agree to a stay of her lawsuit in order to participate\nin that program. (/d., at 2.) As for the prejudice that Plaintiff would purportedly suffer from a\nstay of these proceedings, Plaintiff asserted that, “[flor too long[,] Jeffrey Epstein and\nGhislaine Maxwell skirted the consequences of their vile acts,” and that she should not have to\nwait “even longer for justice.” (/d., at 4.)\n\nMaxwell filed a reply on September 4, 2o2o (see Leter to the Court from Laura A.\nMenninger, Esq., dated Sept. 4, 2o2o (“9/4/2o Menninger Reply Ltr.) (Dkt. 79)), contending\nthat Plaintiff had not adequately demonstrated hou the requested stay would harm her interests,\nand taking issue with Plaintiff's assertions that Maxwell could reasonably litigate this case from\nthe MDC (see id.).\n\nOn September 4, 2o2o, this Court additionally received a leter from Acting United States\nAtorney Audrey Strauss, on behalf of the Government, requesting leave to intervene in this\nmater for the limited purpose of — like Maxwell — seeking a stay of this case, in its entirety,\npending the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the Government’s criminal prosecution against Maxwell. (See Leter to\nthe Court from Audrey Strauss, Acting United States Atorney, by Maurene Comey, Alison Moe,\nand Lara Pomerantz, Assistant United States Atorneys, dated Sept. 4, 2o2o (“9/4/2o Gov’t Ltr.”)\n(Dkt. 8o).) In its leter, the Government urged this Court to stay this action on the grounds that\n“a complete stay of this civil action [would] serve the public interest of preserving the integrity\nof the criminal prosecution against Maxwell and [would] conserve private, public, and judicial\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oool9447", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019448.jpg": "Case C2@-Ao-oo484-DGHUDER ODocemek Go, FICE DLl H2de4PavyedS of l3\nresources; and that those interests [would] outweigh any delay or disruption caused to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of this civil action.” (/d., at l.)\n\nDISCUSSION\nl. THE GOVERNMENT’S REQUEST FOR INTERVENTION\nThe Government is not a party to this civil action against Maxwell, and therefore does not\nhave standing to move for a stay of this action. Thus, for the limited purpose of seeking a stay,\nthe Government has sought leave to intervene in the action. (See 9/4/2o Gov’t Ltr., at l.) This\nCourt finds it unnecessary, houever, to deal with the Government’s leter in an “intervention”\nframework, which would require an inquiry as to whether the Government meets the standards\nset out in Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rather, given that a motion for a stay\nhas already been made by Maxwell, this Court finds it appropriate, in connection with that\nmotion and in the exercise of its discretion, to treat the Government’s submission as that of an\namicus curiae. See, e.g., South Carolina v. North Carolina, 558 U.S. 256, 288 (2olo)\n(Roberts, C.J., concurring in part) (“Courts often treat amicus participation as an alternative to\nintervention.”); Washington State Inv. Bd. v. Odebrecht S.A., No. l7cv8ll8 (PGG), 2ol8 WL\n6253877, at *lo n.2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 2l, 2ol8) (considering company’s submission contesting\nalternative service on chief executive officer as amicus filing); In GLG Life Tech Corp. Sec.\nLitig., 287 F.R.D. 262, 265 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol2) (same); see also Brenner v. Scot, 298 F.R.D. 689\n(N.D. Fla. 2ol4) (not allouing organization that opposed same-sex marriage to intervene in\nPlaintiffs’ actions challenging Florida’s constitutional and statutory provisions banning same-sex\nmarriage, but allouing the organization to be heard as amicus). On this basis, this Court has\nfully considered the views expressed by the Government in its leter.\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oool9448", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019452.jpg": "Case C2@-Ao-oo484-DGHUDER ODoce md, FICE DLl ade Bayeds of l3\n\nHere, Maxwell was indicted by a grand jury on June 29, 2o2o; she has been detained\npending her criminal trial; and her trial date has been set. (8/l9/2o Menninger Ltr., at 2.) Should\ndiscovery in the civil action proceed, Maxwell would be forced to decide whether to defend\nherself by making pretrial disclosures and giving deposition testimony (which could be used\nagainst her in the criminal case) or to invoke her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-\nincrimination (which would protect her in the criminal case, but which could well result in an\nadverse inference being drawn against her in the civil case). (See id., at 4; see also Louis Vuiton\nMalletier, 676 F.3d at 97-98 (discussing the burdens to the Fifth Amendment privilege that may\nbe posed by parallel proceedings).) This legitimate concern, made more real and immediate by\nthe active posture of criminal case, militates in favor of a stay.\n\n3. The Interests of the Plaintiff\n\nPlaintiff asserts that staying this proceeding would harm her interests because, as she is\nsuffering “ongoing damaging effects” from the alleged abuse, and she should not have to wait\nany longer to hold Defendants accountable.

While, as a general\nmater, plaintiffs have a strong interest in the expeditious <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of their civil claims, see\nVolmar Distributors, l52 F.R.D. at 4o, Plaintiff here has not advanced any particularized reason\nwhy a delay would cause her prejudice, such as a likely loss of physical evidence or witness\ntestimony during the period of a stay. (See 8/l9/2o Menninger Ltr., at l (noting that “there is\nlitle chance that any evidence will be lost in the interim given the age of the accusations in this\ncase”); see also id., at 4.)\n\nAdditionally, although this Court is not suggesting that Plaintiff has any obligation to\nagree to a stay so as to pursue her claims through the Compensation Program (and, in fact,\nrecognizes that she does not), this Court does note that a stay would not entirely hinder Plaintiff\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oool9452", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019569.jpg": "Came POBOROOBBoANeht DOCOURBATA o Fed DS3o2 Rag eh age’ iS\nThe Honorable Alison J.

See SEC v. Blaszezak, No. l7-CV-39l9 (AJN),\n2ol8 WL 3olo9l, at *l (S.D.N.Y.

LY USA, Inc., 676 F.3d 83, 98 (2d Cir. 2ol2))). Among other things, the stay\nvindicates the Fifth Amendment and guards against witnesses learning information in the civil\ncase and then “conforming” their testimony in the criminal case to what was disclosed in the\ncivil case.

Given that the\nMaterial has been disclosed in this case by the government under the terms of this Court’s\nOrder, and without any application to the sealing courts, the government has conceded that this\nCourt has the authority to authorize use of the Material under the terms of this Court’s Protective\nOrder. And, the government has previously agreed that the appropriate forum to consider issues\nrelated to the civil Protective Order is in the civil litigation, positing the opinion “that neither it\nnor this Court is well-positioned to, or should, become the arbiter of what is appropriate or\npermissible in civil cases.” Doc. # 33 at 7.

On February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its\nomnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants’ twelve pretrial motions. It filed\nthe brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the\nCourt's <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See\nDkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-—cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket\non ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file\na leter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding\npages ll28 and l87l88 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2o2l.

Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. The Court concludes\nthat these are judicial documents and that the First Amendment and common law\npresumptions of access atach. In balancing competing considerations against the\npresumption of access, houever, the Court finds that the specific arguments the\nGovernment has put forward in this leter, including the need to protect the privacy\ninterests of third parties and alleged victims, favor the narrouly tailored redactions.\nSee United States v.

As a post-trial housekeeping mater, Court staff\ndirected the parties via email to complete the process of providing copies of Court\nExhibits with narrouly tailored redactions (e.g., redactions to protect the anonymity of\njurors and of witnesses the Court permited to testify under pseudonyms) for the Court\nto docket. The Government subsequently submited one court exhibit with the name\nunredacted of a witness subject to the Court's anonymity order. Subsequently the\nDefense indicated in a temporarily sealed leter why the name was unredacted. The\nGovernment is accordingly ORDERED to docket a leter on ECF on or before January\n28, 2o22, indicating why a redaction is no longer being sought for the name of this\nwitness. Once the Government confirms in that leter that it no longer seeks redaction\nof the name, then the Defense may file the temporarily sealed leter on the docket\nwithout redaction of the name. The Court will then docket all Court Exhibits. (Signed\nby Judge Alison J.

The narrouly tailored redactions further the\nimportant interests of helping ensure the integrity of any inquiry and maintaining juror\nanonymity and privacy. As the Court explained in its February ll Order, these\ninterests justify redaction of the questions the parties propose be asked at any hearing\nand specific factual information developed by the parties that has not been publicly\nreported in the press and that the parties propose be inquired about at any forthcoming\nhearing.

(ap) (Entered: o2/24/2o22)\n\no2/24/2o22 | 6lo | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: for the reasons fully explained in the Opinion &\nOrder, a hearing is necessary to resolve the Defendant's motion. Because of the\nimportant interest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a\npost—verdict hearing is high. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that\nthe demanding standard for holding a post—verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to\nwhether Juror 5o failed to respond truthfully during the jury selection process to\nwhether he was a victim of sexual abuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct,\nunambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his oun experience that do\nnot pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses\nduring jury selection. Juror 5o's post-trial statements are \"clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence that a specific, non—speculative impropriety\"namely, a false\nstatement during jury selection has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23,\nl3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that someone with a\nhistory of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential failure\nto respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that\nmaterial information so that any potential bias could be explored. In contrast, the\ndemanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to the conduct of\nany other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect to\nthe other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant's request for a broader hearing\nand pre-hearing discovery. The Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o467", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020468.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page82 of 9l\nwhich the Court will question Juror 5o under oath.

On February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its\nomnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants’ twelve pretrial motions. It filed\nthe brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the\nCourt's <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See\nDkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-—cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions.

Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access.

(ap) (Entered: o2/24/2o22)\n\no2/24/2o22 | 6lo | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: for the reasons fully explained in the Opinion &\nOrder, a hearing is necessary to resolve the Defendant's motion. Because of the\nimportant interest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a\npost—verdict hearing is high. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that\nthe demanding standard for holding a post—verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to\nwhether Juror 5o failed to respond truthfully during the jury selection process to\nwhether he was a victim of sexual abuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct,\nunambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his oun experience that do\nnot pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses\nduring jury selection. Juror 5o's post-trial statements are \"clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence that a specific, non—speculative impropriety\"namely, a false\nstatement during jury selection has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23,\nl3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that someone with a\nhistory of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential failure\nto respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that\nmaterial information so that any potential bias could be explored. In contrast, the\ndemanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to the conduct of\nany other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect to\nthe other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant's request for a broader hearing\nand pre-hearing discovery. The Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o568", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020569.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 3-2, o7/o8/2o22, 3344434, Page83 of 92\nwhich the Court will question Juror 5o under oath.

On February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its\nomnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants' twelve pretrial motions. It filed the\nbrief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the Court's\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See Dkt. No. l62.\nOn March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions that the\nGovernment had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having considered\nthe parties' respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's requests for\nredactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction requests, with the\nexceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the Governments request to file\nExhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that transcript have been redacted, other\nportions are part of the public record.

ENDORSEMENT: The Court grants the\nGovernment's proposed redaction and sealing requests. This conclusion is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga,\n435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the\ndocuments in question are \"judicial documents;\" (ll) assess the weight of the common law\npresumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing considerations against\nthe presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. The Court concludes that these are judicial\ndocuments and that the First Amendment and common law presumptions of access atach.\nIn balancing competing considerations against the presumption of access, houever, the\nCourt finds that the specific arguments the Government has put forward in this leter,\nincluding the need to protect the privacy interests of third parties and alleged victims,\nfavor the narrouly tailored redactions. See United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o\n(2d Cir. l995). The Government's leter does not discuss Exhibit L of Reply Brief 6. By\nApril 23, 2o2l, the parties shall either propose redactions to Exhibit L of Reply Brief 6,\nwhich was originally filed under seal, or they shall indicate to the Court that they seek no\nredactions and file it on ECF.

The Government may prevail if it proves that\nMaxwell’s answers could have led to the discovery of other evidence or could influence the\nfactfinder in the civil case. See Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 5o9; Kross, l4 F.3d at 753-54. At trial, a\nreasonable juror could conclude that truthful answers to the questions may have permited the\nplaintiff to locate other victims or witnesses who could have corroborated the plaintiffs\ntestimony. The factual disputes relating to materiality are at least enough to preclude pretrial\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. In criminal cases, courts must guard against “invading the “inviolable function of the\njury’ in our criminal justice system,” and if the “defense raises a factual dispute that is\ninextricably intertwined with a defendant’s potential culpability, a judge cannot resolve that\ndispute on a Rule l2(b) motion.” United States v.

The perjury charges must be severed and tried separately\n\nAlthough the perjury charges are legally tenable, the Court concludes that the interests of\njustice require severing those counts and trying them separately. Trying the perjury counts\ntogether with the Mann Act counts would require admiting evidence of other acts likely to be\nunduly prejudicial. It would also risk disqualifying Maxwell’s chosen counsel based on their\ninvolvement in the earlier civil case.\n\nRule l4(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure allous a court to order separate\ntrials if joming all offenses in a single trial would prejudice the defendant. A defendant seeking\nseverance must shou significant unfairness to outweigh the burden on the court of conducting\nmultiple trials. United States v. Walker, l42 F.3d lo3, llo (2d Cir. l998). The harm to the\ndefendant must be more than “solely the adverse effect of being tried for two crimes rather than\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o782", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020785.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel67 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 26 of 34\n\nThe balance of these considerations favors severance. “Motions to sever are commited.\nto the sound discretion of the trial judge.” United States v. Casamento, 887 F.2d ll4l, ll49 Qd\nCir. l989). In its discretion, the Court concludes that trying the perjury counts separately will\nbest ensure a fair and expeditious <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of all charges in this case.\n\nVI. Maxwell’s motion to strike surplusage is premature\n\nMaxwell moves to strike allegations related to one of the alleged victims from the Sl\nsuperseding indictment as surplusage. The Court declines to do so at this juncture.\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(d) allous a court to strike surplusage from an\nindictment on a defendant’s motion. “Motions to strike surplusage from an indictment will be\ngranted only where the challenged allegations are not relevant to the crime charged and are\ninflammatory and prejudicial.” United States v. Hernandez, 85 F.3d lo23, lo3o (2d Cir. l996)\n(cleaned up). Courts in this District generally delay ruling on any motion to strike until after the\npresentation of the Government’s evidence at trial, because that evidence may affect hou\nspecific allegations relate to the overall charges. See, e.g., United States v. Nejad, No. l8-cr-224\n(AJN), 2ol9 WL 67o236l, at *l8 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 6, 2ol9); United States v. Mostafa, 965 F.\nSupp. 2d 45l, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3).\n\nMaxwell contends that the allegations related to “Minor Victim-3” are surplusage\nbecause the indictment does not charge that Minor Victim-3 traveled in interstate commerce or\nwas belou the age of consent in England where the alleged activities took place. Thus, she\nargues, these allegations do not relate to the charged conspiracy and instead reflect an atempt to\nintroduce Minor Victim-3’s testimony for impermissible purposes.\n\nThe Court will not strike any language from the Sl superseding indictment at this\njuncture. The standard under Rule 7(d) is “exacting” and requires the defendant to demonstrate\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o785", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020791.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel73 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 32 of 34\n\nD. Rule 4o4(b) material\n\nMaxwell’s final discovery request is for early disclosure of evidence the Government\nseeks to offer under Federal Rule of Evidence 4o4(b). Under Rule 4o4(b), if the prosecutor in a\ncriminal case intends to use “evidence of a crime, wrong, or other act” against a defendant, the\nprosecutor must “provide reasonable notice of the general nature of any such evidence that the\nprosecutor intends to offer at trial” and must “do so in writing before trial—or in any form\nduring trial if the court, for good cause, excuses lack of pretrial notice.” The Government\nrepresents that it will notify the defense of its intent to use 4o4(b) evidence at least 45 days in\nadvance of trial to allou Maxwell to file any motions in limine to be considered at the final\npretrial conference. The Government’s proposal will give Maxwell an opportunity to challenge\nadmission of that evidence and to bring to the Court’s atention any issues that require <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>\nbefore trial. “This is all that Rule 4o4(b) requires.” United States v. Thompson, No. l3-cr-378\n(AJN), 2ol3 WL 6246489, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2ol3). The Court concludes this schedule is\ngenerally reasonable, although additional time to enable briefing and <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> in advance of\ntrial is strongly encouraged.\n\nThe Court’s denial of Maxwell’s requests to compel pretrial disclosures does not preclude\nthe parties from negotiating in good faith for an expedited discovery timeline that will account\nfor Maxwell’s specific concerns. “[I]n most criminal cases, pretrial disclosure will redound to\nthe benefit of all parties, counsel, and the court.” United States v. Percevault, 49o F.2d l26, l32\n(2d Cir. l974). In general, the Court will require the parties to negotiate a final, omnibus\nschedule to propose to the Court. The Court concludes that the disclosure of all of the above\nmaterials approximately six to eight weeks in advance of trial is appropriate and sufficient.\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o79l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021073.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page26 of ll3\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Government prosecuted Ms. Maxwell (“Maxwell”) as a proxy for\nJeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”). It did so to satisfy public outrage over an unpopular\nnon-prosecution agreement and the death of the person responsible for the crimes.\nIn its zeal to pin the blame for its oun incompetence and for Epstein’s crimes on\nMaxwell, the Government breached its promise not to prosecute Maxwell, charged\nher with time-barred offenses, resurrected and recast decades-old allegations for\nconduct previously ascribed to Epstein and other named assistants, and joined\nforces with complainants’ civil atorneys, whose interests were financial, to\ndevelop new allegations that would support charges against Maxwell.\n\nImmediately after Epstein’s death, complainants’ civil atorneys representing\nEpstein victims, including those who testified at trial, began to assist in the creation\nof the Epstein Victims Compensation Program (VCP), a non-adversarial and\nconfidential claims <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> program set up to compensate self-identified victims\nof Epstein, even as they were actively involved in the Government’s investigation.\nOn June 25, 2o2o, the Program began accepting claims. An atorney for one\ncomplainant encouraged her to cooperate with the Government in its case against\nMaxwell because it would improve her prospects for receiving a larger sum of\nmoney from the VCP.

Justice Manual, Comment to § 9-27.63o (emphasis added).

The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged\nin illegal sexual activity with girls.| OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors commited\nprofessional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was\nsigned or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.\nI. OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein\nin 2oo5, after the parents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.\nEpstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and\nother United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an Assistant U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. At a\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if\nEpstein pled guilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration,\nregistered as a sexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain\nmonetary damages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications\nwith Epstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7. The\n: As used in this Report, including in quoted documents and statements, the word “girls” refers to females who\nwere under the age of l8 at the time of the alleged conduct. Under Florida law, a minor is a person under the age\nof l8.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll77", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021178.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document aA 3536o38, Page6 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 4 of 348\nNPA required Epstein to plead guilty in state court to the then-pending state indictment against\nhim and to an additional criminal information charging him with a state offense that would require\nhim to register as a sexual offender—specifically, procurement of minors to engage in prostitution,\nin violation of Florida Statute § 796.o3. The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and seeking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\n2 Emergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C.

Another victim subsequently joined\nthe litigation as “Jane Doe 2.”\nil\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll78", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021179.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ay arene 3536o38, Page7 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 5 of 348\n\nSoon after he was incarcerated, Epstein applied for the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s work\nrelease program, and the Sheriff approved his application. In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.2 The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “‘deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

The Miami Herald report led to public outrage and media scrutiny of the\ngovernment’s actions.*\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the CVRA case petitioners’ Motion for\nPartial Summary Judgment, ruling that the government violated the CVRA in failing to advise the\nvictims about its intention to enter into the NPA.° The court also found that leters the government\nsent to victims after the NPA was signed, describing the investigation as ongoing, “mislead [sic]\nthe victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility.” The court also highlighted\nthe inequity of the USAO’s failure to communicate with the victims while at the same time\nengaging in “lengthy negotiations” with Epstein’s counsel and assuring the defense that the NPA\nwould not be “made public or filed with the court.” The court ordered the parties to submit\nadditional briefs regarding the appropriate remedies. After the court’s order, the Department\nrecused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nNorthern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government. Among the remedies sought\nby the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained\na federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and\none count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. The indictment alleged that from\n2oo2 until 2oo5, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida\nwhom he sexually abused and exploited. Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2ol9. In\narguing for Epstein’s pretrial detention, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein’s\nManhatan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least\none believed to be a minor. The court ordered Epstein detained pending trial, and he was remanded\nto the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in\nManhatan.\n\nMeanwhile, after publication of the November 2ol8 Miami Herald report, the media and\nCongress increasingly focused atention on Acosta as the government official responsible for the\nNPA. On July lo, 2ol9, Acosta held a televised press conference to defend his and the USAO’s\nactions. Acosta stated that the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office “was ready to allou Epstein to\nwalk free with no jail time, nothing.” According to Acosta, because USAO prosecutors considered\nthis outcome unacceptable, his office pursued a difficult and challenging case and obtained a\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> that put Epstein in jail, forced him to register as a sexual offender, and provided victims\nwith the means to obtain monetary damages. Acosta’s press conference did not end the\ncontroversy, houever, and on July l2, 2ol9, Acosta submited to the President his resignation as\n4 See, e.g., Ashley Collman, “Stunning new report details Trump’s labor secretary’s role in plea deal for\nbillionaire sex abuser,” The Business Insider, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Cynthia McFadden, “New Focus on Trump Labor\nSecretary’s role in unusual plea deal for billionaire accused of sexual abuse,” NBC Nightly News, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Anita\nKumar, “Trump labor secretary out of running for atorney general after Miami Herald report,” McClatchy Washington\nBureau, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Emily Peck, “Hou Trump’s Labor Secretary Covered For A Millionaire Sex Abuser,”\nHuffington Post, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Julie K.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.* Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\n7 In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\na OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nVil\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll83", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021186.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye be 3536o38, Pagel4 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 348\n\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll86", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021190.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel8 of 258\nSA-l6\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6 of 348\nll.

Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home,\nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a\ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments. The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, “Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”’®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.”\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\na Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n3 In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021227.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document NR 3536o38, Page55 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 53 of 348\nrecalled generally having conversations with Sloman and Menchel about the Epstein case, but he\ncould not recall with specificity when those conversations took place or the details of the\ndiscussions.\n\nSloman told OPR that because of his broad responsibilities as FAUSA, he left it to\nMenchel, as a highly experienced trial atorney and the Criminal Division Chief, to work directly\nwith Acosta, and Sloman recalled that it was Menchel and Lourie who conducted a “granular\nreview” of the charging package. Acosta confirmed to OPR that Sloman and Menchel “were a\nteam” who became involved in issues as needed, and if Sloman perceived that Menchel was taking\nthe lead on the Epstein mater, Sloman may have deferred to Menchel.\n\nC. May — June 2oo7: Miami Managers Consider the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nand Proposed Charges\n\nWhen she submited the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia intended to file charges by\nMay l5, 2oo7, and the FBI planned to arrest Epstein immediately thereafter. Villafafia, houever,\nhad not obtained authorization to indict on that schedule. The managers in Miami wanted time to\nanalyze the lengthy prosecution memorandum and consider the potential charges and charging\nstrategy. Just a few days after he received the prosecution memorandum, and after learning that\nthe FBI was planning a press conference for May l5, Sloman advised Villafafia that “‘[t]his Office\nhas not approved the indictment. Therefore, please do not commit us to anything at this time.”*®\n\nOn May lo, 2oo7, with Menchel’s concurrence, Lourie sent a copy of Villafafia’s\nprosecution memorandum to CEOS Chief Andrew Oosterban, who in turn sent it to his deputy\nand another CEOS atorney, asking them to assess the legal issues involved in the case and\ndescribing it as a “highly sensitive” case involving “a high profile, very rich defendant.”*? After\nCEOS reviewed the materials, Oosterban responded to Lourie with an email stating that the\nmemorandum was “exhaustive” and “well done” and noting that Villafafia “has correctly focused\non the issues as we see them.” He summarized CEOS’s analysis of the application of key facts to\nthe statutes she proposed charging, concurring in Villafafia’s assessments but noting that further\nresearch was needed to determine whether certain statutes required proof of a defendant’s\nknouledge of victims’ ages. Oosterban offered to assign a CEOS atorney to work with Villafafia\non the case. Lourie forwarded Oosterban’s email to Menchel and Villafafia.\n\nMeanwhile, contemporaneous emails shou that Lourie, at least, was already considering\nan early <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the case through a pre-indictment plea agreement.” After Lourie spoke with\n38 Lourie later reported to Menchel that the FBI had “wanted to arrest [Epstein] in [the] Virgin Islands during a\nbeauty pageant .. . where he is a judge.” The case agent recalled that she and her co-case agent were disappointed\nwith the decision, and that the Supervisory Special Agent was “extremely upset” about it. After the federal\ninvestigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2oo6, Epstein largely stayed\naway from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.\n\na Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterban was an AUSA at the USAO for about ten years and was good\nfriends with Lourie.\na In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it “may\nundermine our arguments for pretrial detention.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening\na bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l227", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021228.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document Na 3536o38, Paged6 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 54 of 348\nthe FBI squad supervisor on May 9, 2oo7, to explain that charges against Epstein would not be\nquickly approved, he reported to Menchel that the FBI was “not happy” about the delay, adding,\n“T did not even tell them I think we should bring [Epstein] in, once we decide to charge him, and\noffer a pre-indictment deal, figuring a judge might never agree to such a deal post indictment. That\nwould have sent them thru the roof.” Lourie explained to OPR that he thought a judge, after seeing\nan indictment charging the full nature and scope of Epstein’s conduct, might not agree to a plea\ninvolving substantially less time or to dismiss substantive charges. *!\n\nLourie told OPR that despite Oosterban’s favorable opinion of the case, “[t]his was... a\nbit of uncharted territory,” involving facts that were unlike the case law Oosterban had cited.\nAlthough Lourie had some concerns about the legal issues and about the witnesses, he “probably”\ndid not see any impediment to going forward with the case; in fact, Lourie “was not in favor of\nwalking away, which is what the defense wanted [the USAO] to do.” But while Lourie “thought\nwe could have won and we could have prevailed through appeal,” he “didn’t think the odds were\nnearly as good as you want in a criminal case, and . . . the things that we had to gain [through a\nplea agreement] were much more than [in] a normal criminal case,” in which the only cost of a\nloss would be that the defendant did not go to jail. Lourie told OPR that to the best of his\nrecollection, he thought a plea agreement would be a good result, and although the government\nmight have to “give up some jail time,” there were other benefits to a plea, such as the ability to\nrequire Epstein to register as a sex offender and the availability of monetary damages for the\nvictims. Lourie recalled “thinking that this case should setle and we should set it up so we can\nsetle it” by, for example, charging Epstein by complaint and then negotiating a plea to limited\ncharges in a criminal information. Villafafia told OPR that she agreed with Lourie that a criminal\ncomplaint charging an “omnibus conspiracy” containing “all of the information related to what the\ncase was about” would be a good way to “get things moving” touard a pre-indictment plea.\n\nAlthough Lourie and Villafafia believed a pre-indictment plea agreement was a desired\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, there was no guarantee that Epstein would agree to plead guilty, and they continued to\nwork together to shape an indictment. On May lo, 2oo7, Lourie emailed Villafafia:\n\n[M]arie\n\nI believe that Epstein’s at[orneys] are scared of the victims they\n\ndon’t knou. Epstein has no doubt told them that there were many.\n\nThus I believe the f[ir]st indictment should contain only the victims\n\nthey have nothing on at all. We can add in the other ones that have\n\nmyspace [sic] pages and prior testimony in a [superseding\n\nindictment]. I think for the first strike we should make all their\n\nnightmare[]s come true. Thoughts?”\nee Lourie explained to OPR that the government’s dismissal of counts in an indictment required the court’s\napproval, and that, while “it’s rare,” it was possible that a judge, seeing the nature and extent of Epstein’s conduct as\nset forth in an extensive indictment, might not allou substantive counts to be dismissed.\n42 Lourie’s references to MySpace pages and “prior testimony” referred to the impeachment information\nbrought forward by defense counsel.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l228", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021229.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ary eae 3536o38, Paged/ of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 55 of 348\n\nLourie folloued up his email to Villafafia with one to Menchel, in which Lourie reiterated\nthe potential benefits of a pre-indictment plea, explaining that he and Villafafia believed “the best\nthing to do is charge Epstein by complaint, assuming we decide to charge him. ... The\n[sentencing] guidelines will be in the 2o year range, so we would need to plead him to one or two\nconspiracies to cap him and there is no telling if a judge would go for that once we indict.”*\nMenchel responded that he and Acosta would read the prosecution memorandum and “[w]e can\ndiscuss after that.”\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia sent Lourie an email, which Lourie forwarded to Menchel,\nexplaining that a “conservative calculation” of Epstein’s potential sentencing exposure under the\nU.S. Sentencing Guidelines would be l68 to 2lo months, and that in her view, the facts warranted\nan upward departure from that range. Villafafia told OPR that although Lourie proposed some\nchanges to the draft indictment, at that point no one had told her that the evidence was insufficient\nto support the proposed charges or that the office did not want to go forward with the case.\n\nIn an email to Acosta and Menchel on May ll, 2oo7, Lourie recommended charging\nEpstein by complaint and seeking a pre-indictment plea:\n\nMy current thoughts are that we should charge him. Not sure that I\nagree with the charging strategy as it is nou, but at this point I think\nwe only need to get on the same page as to whether the statutes cover\nthe conduct and whether the conduct is the type we should charge.\nI think the answer to both is yes, although there is some risk on some\nof the statutes as this is uncharted territory to some degree. We can\ndecide later what the [charging document] should look like precisely\nand which victims should be charged.\n\nI also think if we choose to go forward, we should start with a\ncomplaint, arrest him, detain him . . . and then try to see if he wants\na pre-indictment <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. That would give us more control [over]\na plea than if we indict him and need the court’s approval to dismiss\ncounts. We will need to cap him with conspiracy counts to make a\nplea atractive and the court could give us a hard time with that if we\ntry to dismiss indicted counts.\n\nAlthough her supervisors were communicating among themselves about the case, Villafafia\nwas unaware of those discussions and was frustrated that she was not receiving more feedback.\nShe continued preparing to charge Epstein. Two weeks after submiting the prosecution\nmemorandum, on May l4, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Lourie and Menchel by email that Epstein\nwas flying to New Jersey from the Virgin Islands, and she asked whether she could file charges\nthe next day. Menchel responded that “[y]ou will not have approval to go forward tomorrou,”\nand explained that Acosta “has your [prosecution] memo,” but was at an out-of-toun conference,\nadding, “This is obviously a very significant case and [A]lex wants to take his time making sure\n43 Lourie told OPR that he was referring to one or two counts of conspiracy under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, the general\n“omnibus” federal conspiracy statute that carries a maximum sentence of five years.\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l229", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021236.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 6D 3536o38, Page64 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 62 of 348\n\ndamages.°°? During a two-month period, the subject atorneys were involved to varying degrees in\nconverting the broad outline into specific terms, resulting in the NPA signed by Epstein on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both\nthe larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of\nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the\nfacts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> or the NPA.\n\nIn the follouing account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous\ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR\nquestioned each of the subjects about hou the decision was reached to pursue a state <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>,\nand OPR includes belou the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA, June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea <span class=\"highlight\">Resolution</span>, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> shortly thereafter.”°° In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal investigation that could\n32 State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw enforcement and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities. The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry\nis administered by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n58 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l236", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021237.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N63 3536o38, Page65 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 63 of 348\ninclude concurrent time.” The email primarily concerned other issues, and Villafafia did not\nexplain what the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> she had in mind would entail.°’ Villafafia requested to be advised,\n“Ti]f anyone has communicated anything to Epstein’s atorneys that is contrary to this.” Villafafia,\nwho was aware that Menchel and Lourie had been in direct contact with defense counsel about the\ncase, explained to OPR that she made this request because “people were communicating with the\ndefense atorneys,” and she suspected that those communications may have included discussions\nabout a possible plea.\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s email, Menchel notified Villafafia that he had told Sanchez “a\nstate plea [with] jail time and sex offender status may satisfy the [U.S. Atorney],” but Sanchez\nhad responded that it “was a non-starter for them.”°’ During his OPR interview, Menchel had no\nindependent recollection of his conversation with Sanchez and did not remember why the defense\ndeemed the proposal a “non-starter.” Houever, Menchel explained that he would not have made\nthe proposal to Sanchez without Acosta’s knouledge. He also pointed out that in numerous emails\nbefore the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, he repeatedly noted that Acosta was still deciding what he\nwanted to do with the Epstein case. Acosta agreed, telling OPR that although he did not remember\na specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, Menchel would not have\ndiscussed a potential <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> with Sanchez “without having discussed it with me.”\n\nl. Acosta’s Explanation for His Decision to Pursue a State-based\n<span class=\"highlight\">Resolution</span>\n\nSubsequent events shoued that the decision to resolve the case through state charges was\npivotal, and OPR extensively questioned Acosta about his reasoning. In his OPR interview, Acosta\nexplained the various factors that influenced his decision to pursue a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. Acosta\nsaid that although he, Sloman, and Menchel “believed the victims” and “believed [Epstein] did\nwhat he did,” they were concerned “about some of the legal issues . . . and some of the issues in\nterms of testimony.” Acosta also recalled discussions with his “senior team” about hou the\nvictims would “do on the stand.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “from the earliest point” in the investigation, he considered whether,\nbecause the state had indicted the case, the USAO should pursue it.\n\nSf Villafafia explained to OPR that she intended to recommend a plea to a federal conspiracy charge and a\nsubstantive charge, “consistent with the Ashcroft Memo, which would be the most readily provable offense,” with “a\nrecommendation that the sentence on the federal charges run concurrent with the state sentence, or that [Epstein]\nwould receive credit for time in state custody touards his federal release date.” See n.65 for an explanation of the\nAshcroft Memo.\n\n58 Villafafia was then in trial and on July 4, 2oo7, likely before reading Menchel’s email, Villafafia responded\nto defense counsel regarding the demand for records and also noted, “If you would like to discuss the possibility of a\nfederal <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> . . . that could run concurrently with any state <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, please leave a message on my voicemail.”\nSY In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Sloman stated he had no involvement in assessing the Epstein case or\ndeciding hou to resolve it, and that OPR should not identify him as among the people upon whom Acosta relied in\nreaching the two-year-state-plea <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> through the NPA. Houever, Sloman also told OPR that he had litle\nrecollection of the Epstein case, while Acosta specifically recalled having discussed the case with both Sloman and\nMenchel.\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l237", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021239.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 6S 3536o38, Page67 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 65 of 348\nI do think it’s important to look back on this, and try to be in the\nshoes of the thought process in 2oo6 and ’o7 when trafficking\nprosecutions were fairly new, when... more so than today, some\njurors may have looked at this as prostitution, and .. . [a] judge’s\ntolerance for victim shaming may have . . . caused more hesitation\non the part of victims... .©\nFinally, Acosta told OPR that a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> offered more flexibility in fashioning\na sentence, because he believed prosecutors would have difficulty persuading a federal district\ncourt in the Southern District of Florida to approve a federal plea for a stipulated binding sentence\nthat differed from the otherwise applicable federal sentencing guidelines range.“\nIn summarizing his thinking at the time, Acosta told OPR,\nThe way the mater came to the office was, the state wasn’t doing\nenough. It didn’t provide for prison time. It didn’t provide for\nregistration, and then you had the restitution issue. There were legal\nissues .... There were witness issues. And... we could go to trial\n...and we may or may not prevail. Alternatively, we could look at\na pre-indictment <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, and at various points, the office went\nback and forth between a federal pre-indictment <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, and a\nstate pre-indictment <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>.\nAcosta told OPR that, in the end, “there was a preference for deferring to the state” because, in\npart, the facts of the Epstein case at the time appeared to constitute solicitation or prostitution\nrather than trafficking, and a federal prosecution would be “uncharted territory.” Acosta explained\nthat he did not view it as problematic to defer <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the case to the state, although as the\nEpstein case played out, the federal role became “more intrusive” than he had anticipated, because\nthe defense tried to get the state to “circumvent and undermine” the outcome.\nAtorney’s Office could have proceeded against Epstein by way of an information, but decided to go into the grand\njury because the State Atorney’s Office “didn’t like the case” and wanted “political cover” for declining the case or\nproceeding on a lesser charge.\n83 Menchel told OPR, houever, that the federal judges in West Palm Beach were highly regarded and were\ngenerally viewed as “pro-prosecution.”\n64 Acosta said that “dismissing a number of counts and then doing a [R]ule ll is not something that [South\nFlorida federal district] judges tend to do.” Other subjects also told OPR that the federal judges in the Southern District\nof Florida were generally considered averse to pleas that bound them on sentencing, commonly referred to as “Rule\nll(c) pleas.”\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) allous the parties to agree on a specific sentence as part of\na plea agreement. The court is required to impose that sentence if the court accepts the plea agreement; if the court\ndoes not accept the agreed upon plea and sentence, the agreement is void. Villafafia told OPR that Rule ll(c) pleas\nwere “uncommon” in the Southern District of Florida, as the “judges do not like to be told . . . what sentence to\nimpose.” Menchel similarly told OPR that the USAO viewed federal judges in the Southern District of Florida as\naverse to Rule ll(c) pleas, although Menchel had negotiated such pleas. Villafafia told OPR that she had never offered\na Rule ll(c) plea in any of her cases and had no experience with such pleas.\n39\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l239", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021240.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N66 3536o38, Page68 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 66 of 348\nMenchel could not recall who initially suggested a state plea, but noted to OPR that his\noun “emails... make clear that this course of action was ultimately decided by Alex Acosta.” He\nreferenced, among others, his May l4, 2oo7 email to Villafafia informing her that Acosta was\ndeciding hou he wanted to handle the case. Menchel surmised that a state <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> accomplished\ntwo things that Acosta viewed as important: first, it resolved any Petite policy concerns, and\nsecond, it afforded more flexibility in sentencing than a federal plea would have alloued. Menchel\ntold OPR that the state plea proposal did not reflect any minimization of Epstein’s conduct and\nthat any state plea would have been to an offense that required sexual offender registration. He\ntold OPR, “I don’t think anybody sat around and said, you knou, it’s not that big a deal. That was\nnot the reaction that I think anybody had from the federal side of this case.” Rather, Menchel said,\n“The concern was if we charge him [as proposed], there’s going to be a trial.”\n2. July 2oo7: Villafaia and Menchel Disagree about the Proposed State\n<span class=\"highlight\">Resolution</span>\nVillafafia told OPR that she was angry when she received Menchel’s July email explaining\nthat he had proposed to Sanchez resolving the federal investigation through a state plea. In\nVillafafia’s view, the proposed state <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> “didn’t make any sense” and “did not correspond”\nto Department policy requiring that a plea offer reflect “the most serious readily provable\noffense.”® In her view, a plea to a state charge “obviously” would not satisfy this policy. Villafafia\nalso told OPR that in her view, the USAM required the USAO to confer with the investigative\nagency about plea negotiations, and Villafafia did not believe the FBI would be in favor of a state\nplea. Villafafia also believed the CVRA required atorneys for the government to confer with\nvictims before making a plea offer, but the victims had not been consulted about this proposal.\nVillafafia told OPR she had met with some of the victims during the course of the investigation\nwho had negative impressions of the State Atorney’s Office, and she believed that “sending them\nback to the State Atorney’s Office was not something” those victims would support.\nbe This policy was set forth in a September 22, 2oo3 memorandum from then Atorney General John Ashcroft\nregarding “Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and Sentencing”\n(knoun as the “Ashcroft Memo”), which provided, in pertinent part:\n[I]n all federal criminal cases, federal prosecutors must charge and pursue the\nmost serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts\nof the case, except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, United States\nAtorney, or designated supervisory atorney in the limited circumstances\ndescribed belou. The most serious offense or offenses are those that generate the\nmost substantial sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, unless a mandatory\nminimum sentence or count requiring a consecutive sentence would generate a\nlonger sentence. A charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor has a good\nfaith doubt, for legal or evidentiary reasons, as to the Government’s ability readily\nto prove a charge at trial. Thus, charges should not be filed simply to exert\nleverage to induce a plea. Once filed, the most serious readily provable charges\nmay not be dismissed except to the extent permited [elsewhere in this\nMemorandum].\nSee also Chapter Two, Part Two, Section I.B.l.\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l24o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021241.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page69 of 258\nSA-67\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 67 of 348\n\nIn light of these concerns, Villafafia emailed Menchel, expressing her strong disagreement\nwith the process:\n\n[I]t is inappropriate for you to enter into plea negotiations without\nconsulting with me or the investigative agencies, and it is more\ninappropriate to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE [Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement], the victims, and me. These plea negotiations violate\nthe Ashcroft memo, the U.S. Atorney[s’] Manual, and all of the\nvarious iterations of the victims’ rights legislation. Strategically,\nyou have started the plea negotiations as though we are in a position\nof weakness, anxious to make the case go away, by telling the\ndefense that we will demand no federal conviction. We left the\nmeeting on June 26th in a stronger position than when we entered,\nand your statement that a state <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> would satisfy us takes\naway that advantage. If you make it seem like the U.S. Atorney\ndoesn’t have faith in our investigation, Epstein has no incentive to\nmake a deal.\n\nSecond, your discussion makes it appear that my investigation is for\n“shou” only and completely undermines my ability to deal with\nEpstein’s atorneys directly. ...\n\nI would like to make a presentation to the U.S. Atorney, Jeff\n[Sloman], Andy [Lourie], and you with our side of the investigation\nand a revised indictment. The presentation will address the points\nraised by Epstein’s counsel and will convince you all of the strength\nof the case.\n\nIn the meantime, please direct all communications from Epstein’s\ncounsel to me.\n\nMenchel told OPR he realized Villafafia was “very anxious” to file charges in the case.\nVillafafia had put a “tremendous” amount of effort into the investigation, and Menchel “was not\nunsympathetic at all to her desires” to pursue a federal case. Houever, as Menchel told OPR,\nVillafafia’s supervisors, including Acosta, were “trying to be a litle bit more dispassionate,” and\nher urgency was “not respectful” of Acosta’s position. Menchel viewed the tone of Villafafia’s\nemail as “highly unacceptable,” and her understanding of applicable law and policy incorrect. In\nparticular, Menchel pointed out that although the Ashcroft Memo requires prosecutors to charge\nthe “most readily provable offense,” there is nevertheless room for “flexibility,” and that the U.S.\nAtorney has discretion—directly or through a designated supervisor such as Menchel—to waive\nthe policy.\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l24l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021246.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye, ae 3536o38, Page/4 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 72 of 348\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.’”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based.\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n@ In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

Acosta Decides on a <span class=\"highlight\">Resolution</span> That Includes a Two-Year Term of\nIncarceration\n\nThe next critical step in the development of the NPA was the decision to propose a two-\nyear term of imprisonment. Although presented to the defense as the “minimum” the USAO would\naccept, in actuality the two-year proposal became only the starting point for the negotiations, with\nthe result that the defense continued to chip away at it as the negotiations continued. The\ncontemporaneous emails make no mention of any rationale for the decision to propose two years\nas the government’s beginning negotiating position, and nobody with whom OPR spoke was able\nto recall hou the decision was made. As discussed belou, Acosta did offer OPR an explanation,\nbut OPR was unable to find contemporaneous evidence supporting it.’°\n\nWhile the defense was communicating its objections to the federal investigation to\nVillafafia, Lourie, Menchel, and Sloman, Villafafia continued moving touard filing charges. On\nJuly l9, 2oo7, the day after receiving Oosterban’s email supporting a potential prosecution,\nVillafafia emailed Lourie and Menchel seeking approval to take further investigative steps\nregarding three of Epstein’s assistants. Houever, Menchel directed Villafafia to “hold off... until\nwe decide what course of action we are going to take on [E]pstein which should happen next\nweek.” Menchel told OPR that he did not specifically recall why he asked Villafafia to wait, but\nhe assumed it was because Acosta was deciding what course of action to take on the case.\n\nOn Monday, July 23, 2oo7, Menchel submited a resignation notice to Acosta, stating that\nhe would be leaving the USAO effective August 6, 2oo7.77\n\nl. The July 26, 2oo7 Meeting in Miami\n\nEarly on the morning of Thursday, July 26, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Menchel that she was\npreparing a new draft indictment containing revisions he had suggested, including removal of all\nbut three of the “travel counts” and “a large number of [the] overt acts,” and the addition of overt\nacts and counts relating to two additional victims; she would not, houever, have the revised\nindictment ready in time “for our discussion today” at their 2:oo p.m. meeting. Menchel told OPR\nthat the fact that he had both proposed revisions to the indictment and also directed Villafafia to\ndelay the investigative steps involving the assistants indicated that he was “trying to do something”\nwith the case, but was waiting for Acosta to decide the “underlying issue” of whether to proceed\nwith federal charges.\n\nAcosta made that decision on or before July 26, 2oo7. On that afternoon, Villafafia met in\nMiami with Menchel. She told OPR that Sloman, as well as the FBI case agents and their\nsupervisors, were also present, with Lourie participating by telephone. Villafafia told OPR that\nshe expected that the meeting, requested by Menchel, would address the direction of the\ninvestigation. Houever, Villafafia told OPR that after everyone had assembled, Menchel entered\nthe room and stated that Acosta “has decided to offer a two-year state deal.” According to\nis See Section IV.D.2 in this Part.\n77 As early as May 4, 2oo7, Menchel had informed Acosta that he was intending to leave the USAO to enter\nprivate practice.\n\n48\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l248", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021249.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye, ae 3536o38, Page/7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 75 of 348\nVillafafia, Menchel left the meeting after almost no discussion, leaving Villafafia “shocked and\nstunned.”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall the July 26, 2oo7 meeting. Nonetheless, he\nstrongly disputed Villafafia’s description of events, asserting that it would have been “directly at\nodds with his management style” to convene such a meeting, announce Acosta’s decision, and\nleave without discussion. Acosta told OPR that he had “decided and endorsed this <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> at\nsome point,” but he did not recall being aware that Menchel was going to announce the decision\nat the July 26 meeting; in addition, although Acosta did not recall the circumstances of Menchel’s\nrelaying of that decision, he said it “would have been consistent with” his decision for Menchel to\ndo so. Neither Sloman nor Lourie recalled the meeting. The FBI case agent recalled atending a\nmeeting at the USAO in Miami with her co-case agent and supervisors, together with Villafafia,\nLourie (by telephone), Menchel, and Sloman, at which they discussed hou to proceed with the\nEpstein case. According to the case agent, at this meeting the FBI insisted that Epstein be\nregistered for life as a sexual offender, and the co-case agent advocated for waiting until the court\nhad ruled on the USAO’s ability to obtain Epstein’s computer equipment.\n\nRegardless of exactly hou Acosta’s decision regarding the two-year term was\ncommunicated to Villafafia and the FBI agents, and regardless of who initially proposed the\nspecific term, the record shous that Acosta ultimately made the decision to offer Epstein a\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> that included a two-year term of imprisonment, as he acknouledged. ”\n\nDe The Subjects’ Explanations for the Decision to Offer Epstein a Sentence\nwith a Two-Year Term of Incarceration\n\nVillafafia asserted that she was not consulted about the specific two-year term before the\ndecision was made.”” Villafafia told OPR that she had worked hard to develop a strong case, and\nnone of her supervisors had identified to her any specific problem with the case that, in her view,\nexplained the decision to extend an offer for a two-year sentence. Villafafia also told OPR that\nMenchel provided no explanation for this decision during the July 26, 2oo7 meeting, and Villafafia\ndid not ask for an explanation because she accepted his statement that it was Acosta’s decision.\nVillafafia described the proposal as “random,” and told OPR, “[W]e’re all [sentencing] guidelines\npeople, so 24 months just makes no sense in the context of the guidelines. There’s no way to get\nto 24 months with this set of offenses.”°°\n78 OPR notes that Villafafia did not appear hesitant to send emails to her supervisors seting forth her views and\nobjections, and there is no reference before this meeting in any of her emails indicating that a decision had been made\nto offer a two-year term of incarceration. Therefore, given that a meeting had been arranged involving Menchel and\nVillatfafia, and possibly most of the other primary USAO and FBI participants, it seems logical that Acosta made a\ndecision to resolve the case with a two-year state plea not long before the meeting.\n\na OPR found no evidence in the documentary record indicating that Villafafia had knouledge of Acosta’s\ndecision or the two-year term before the July 26, 2oo7 meeting at which she said she learned of it.\n4a From the time the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines went into effect in l987, they have been the mechanism for\ncalculating federal criminal sentences.

He opined to OPR that the decision was likely based on an\nassessment by Menchel and Lourie of the litigation risks presented by the case.*! Sloman added\nthat he did not knou hou a two-year sentence might have related to specific charges or to either\nstate or federal sentencing guidelines. Lourie likewise told OPR he did not recall hou the two-year\nterm was decided upon, or by whom, but he speculated that it may have been presented by the\ndefense as the most Epstein would accept, and that the decision would have been reached by\nAcosta follouing “extended consideration, research, and discussion,” among Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. **\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall discussing a two-year plea deal with Acosta or\nwho reached the decision that two years was an appropriate sentence. Menchel also told OPR,\nhouever, that he recalled believing that if the USAO had filed the contemplated federal charges,\nEpstein would have felt he had “nothing to lose” and “undoubtedly” would have chosen to take\nthe case to trial. Menchel recalled believing there was a real risk that the USAO might lose at trial,\nand in so doing, might cause more trauma to the victims, particularly those who were reluctant to\ntestify. Menchel told OPR that he did not believe that anyone at the time looked at two years “as\na fair result in terms of the conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not\nif we took this case to trial, would we risk losing everything,” and “if we. . . felt we could have\ngoten more time, we would have, without having to press it to the trial.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “I had decided and endorsed” the two-year <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> “at some\npoint,” and that it resulted from “back and forth” discussion “over the course of some days or a\nweek or two.” As noted earlier in this Report, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in this case merely\nas a “backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he explained to OPR was “a polite way of saying[,\n‘Jencouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]”®’ Acosta said that he understood two years’\nimprisonment to have represented the sentence Epstein faced under one of the original charges the\nPBPD was considering at the outset of the state investigation.** Acosta also told OPR that he\n\nthe atorney for the government has a continuing obligation to assist the court in\n\nits determination of the sentence to be imposed. The prosecutor must be familiar\n\nwith the guidelines generally and with the specific guideline provisions applicable\n\nto his or her case. In discharging these duties, the atorney for the government\n\nshould . . . endeavor to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information\n\nupon which the sentencing decisions will be based.\n8l In Sloman’s view, Menchel and Lourie were “two of the finest trial lawyers” in the USAO.\n82 Lourie noted that Sloman and Menchel were “two extraordinarily experienced people in [Acosta’s] front\noffice who had tried . . . gobs and gobs of cases.”\nBS In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney asserted that OPR’s use of Acosta’s quote, “a litle\nbit more,” “unfairly minimized” Acosta’s and the USAO’s efforts to achieve justice in this case. Acosta’s atorney\nalso asserted that the phrase was “clearly soft-spoken understatement,” that the terms obtained were “substantially\nmore onerous than the state’s alternative <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>,” and that Acosta was “clearly declining the invitation to take the\nState to task and soft-pedaling an obvious distinction.”\n\nSA OPR examined this assertion and was unable to verify that the proposed two-year term of imprisonment\ncorresponded with the charges that the PBPD considered at the outset of the state investigation or with the charge in\n5o\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l25o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021254.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N8o 3536o38, Page82 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8o of 348\nthe period of imprisonment, because the USAO failed to hold firm to its proposal of “at least two\nyears in prison.” The USAO did, houever, consistently reject defense proposals to change other\nterms, particularly the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.\nA. July 3l, 2oo7: The USAO Presents Its Proposal to the Defense Team, which\nMakes a Counteroffer\n\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, Villafafia, and the case agents met with Epstein atorneys\nLefcourt, Sanchez, and Black on July 3l, 2oo7, with Menchel “leading the meeting” for the\nUSAO.®’ The USAO presented the term sheet, and Villafafia distributed a federal sentencing\nguidelines calculation shouing that if prosecuted federally, Epstein faced a sentencing range of\nl88 to 235 months’ incarceration.\n\nVillafafia recalled that during the meeting, Epstein’s atorneys opposed the requirement of\nsexual offender registration, argued that Epstein would not be safe in prison, suggested that Epstein\nserve a sentence of home confinement or “community control”®* in lieu of incarceration, and\nemphasized that a state <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> provided greater sentencing flexibility. Villafafia told OPR\nthat when Epstein’s atorneys expressed concern during the meeting about Epstein’s security in a\nstate prison and argued for a home confinement sentence, Menchel suggested Epstein plead to a\nfederal charge so that he could serve his time in a federal facility. A few days after the meeting,\nVillafafia emailed Menchel, stating that she had “figured out a way to do a federal plea with a 2-l/2\nyear cap.”\n\nAlthough Acosta had authorized a plea to state charges, emails and other correspondence\nshou that during the negotiations, the parties also considered structuring a plea around federal\n87 Villafafia was the only witness with whom OPR spoke who had a substantive memory of this meeting.\n\n88 According to the Florida Department of Corrections fact sheet for defendants subjected to community control,\n\nThe Community Control supervision program was created as a diversion to\n\nincarceration or imprisonment; therefore it is an intensive supervision program\n\nwhere you are confined to your home unless you are working, atending school,\n\nperforming public service hours, participating in treatment or another special\n\nactivity that has been approved in advance by your officer.

We did not.” Villafafia anticipated there would be ways to “manipulate” a state\nsentence and the USAO would be “giving up all control,” and she told OPR that she discussed this concern with\nLourie, although she could not recall when that discussion occurred.\n\n54\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l254", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021257.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N83 3536o38, Page85 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 83 of 348\nSores.

Sloman similarly told OPR that the squad supervisor “like\n[Villafafia] . . . [a]nd the agents felt very strongly about the case.”??\n\nC. August — September 2oo7: Epstein Hires Additional Atorneys, Who Meet\n\nwith Acosta\nl, Acosta Agrees to Meet with Epstein’s New Atorneys\n\nVillafafia told OPR that Epstein’s team was “incensed” that Acosta would not meet with\nthem and that the USAO had set such a short deadline to respond to its offer. Around this time,\nEpstein added to his team Kenneth Starr and Jay Lefkouitz, two prominent atorneys from the law\nfirm Kirkland & Ellis, whom Acosta knew from his employment a decade earlier as an associate\nat the firm.°* On the evening of August 6, 2oo7, Sloman emailed Acosta: “Just saw Menchel. I\ndidn’t knou Kirkland made a call into you. You were right. Unbelievable.” During their OPR\ninterviews, neither Acosta nor Sloman remembered the call from Kirkland & Ellis and could\nprovide no additional information about the contact.?> A reply email from Acosta to Sloman\nindicates that the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys were considering elevating to the Department their\nobjections to the USAO’s involvement in the Epstein mater. In that email, Acosta stated, “They\nare likely to go to DC. We should strategize a bit. We are not changing positions, and that should\nbe made clear.”\n\nThe next day, Acosta wrote to Sloman:\n\n[Epstein’s] atorneys want to go to DC on the case, on the grounds\n\nof a process foul, i.e., that I have not met with them. I’m concerned\n\nthat this will delay maters.\n\nI am thinking of heading this off, by (l) agreeing to meet to discuss\n\ngeneral legal policy only (the only mater in which DC has arguable\n% In an email to Lourie reporting the conversation, Sloman reported that he told the squad supervisor that “it’s\na tad more complicated” and commented, “The guy is killing me.” The squad supervisor told OPR that he did not\nremember this exchange with Sloman, but he recalled the agents being “upset” with the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the\ncase and he likely would have told Sloman, “When do we indict? Why don’t we just move forward?”\na4 Acosta told OPR that as a junior associate with Kirkland & Ellis from September l995 to March l997, he\nhad worked on at least one mater each with Starr and Lefkouitz, and since that time, he had professional\nacquaintanceships with both.\n95 Menchel told OPR that he did not remember the timing of the call, but he did remember an occasion on which\nhe entered Acosta’s office as Acosta was finishing a phone conversation, and Acosta stated, “[T]hat was Ken Starr,”\nand told Menchel the call related to the Epstein case.\n\n59\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l259", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021263.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 89 3536o38, Page9l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 89 of 348\nforward, that either there is this pre-indictment <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, or we go forward with an indictment.\nThe September meeting did not alter or shift our position.”!%\n\nVillafafia told OPR that after hearing the defense argument, Acosta reiterated that the\nfederal interest in the case could be vindicated only by a state plea to an offense that required\nsexual offender registration, resulted in a two-year term of incarceration, and was subject to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 process for providing compensation to the victims. When defense counsel\nobjected to the registration requirement, Acosta held firm, and he also rejected the defense proposal\nfor a sentence of home confinement. In a subsequent email exchange with Criminal Division\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal Mandelker, who supervised CEOS, Oosterban reported\nthat the meeting was “non-eventful,” noting that defense counsel argued “federalism” and might\napproach Criminal Division Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher to present that argument\ndirectly to her.\n\nVI. SEPTEMBER 2oo7: THE PLEA NEGOTIATIONS INTENSIFY, AND IN THE\n\nPROCESS, THE REQUIRED TERM OF IMPRISONMENT IS REDUCED\n\nAcosta had dispensed with the August l7, 2oo7 plea deadline specified in Menchel’s\nAugust 3, 2oo7 leter, in order to allou the defense to meet with him. After that meeting, and\nalthough Villafafia continued to plan to file charges on September 25, no new plea deadline was\nestablished, and the negotiations continued through most of September.\n\nThe defense used that time to push the USAO to make concessions. Because Acosta was\nnot willing to compromise on the issue of sexual offender registration or providing a means\nthrough which the victims could seek monetary damages, the negotiations focused on the term of\nimprisonment. As the contemporaneous emails shou, the USAO did not hold to its position that\na two-year term of imprisonment was “the minimum” that the USAO would accept. To reach an\nagreement with the defense on Epstein’s sentence, the USAO explored possible pleas in either\nfederal or state court, or both, and Villafafia spent considerable time and effort working with\ndefense counsel on developing alternative pleas with various outcomes. In the course of that\nprocess, the agreement was revised to require that Epstein accept a sentence of l8 months, with\nthe understanding that under the state’s sentencing procedures, he would likely serve just l5\nmonths.\n\nA. The Incarceration Term Is Reduced from 24 Months to 2o Months\n\nShortly after the September 7, 2oo7 meeting, Epstein atorney Gerald Lefcourt, who had\nnot been present at the meeting, spoke with both Acosta and Lourie, and made a new counteroffer,\nproposing that Epstein serve l5 months in jail folloued by l5 months in home confinement. On\nthe afternoon of Monday, September lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, identifying issues she\nwanted to discuss with him, including her concern that defense counsel was pushing for a\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> that would allou Epstein to avoid incarceration and possibly sexual offender\nregistration. Villafafia stated that Lefcourt’s counteroffer was “a reasonable counteroffer in light\nof our starting position of 24 months,” but added that it was “a really lou sentence.” Villafafia\nlo3 Sloman echoed this point, telling OPR that Starr’s presentation focused on the issue of federalism, but the\nUSAO had already decided to defer prosecution to the state and after the meeting, the USAO continued on that path.\n\n63\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l263", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021265.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document NOL 3536o38, Page93 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 9l of 348\n\nVillafafia told OPR that during the meeting, the group discussed the draft NPA, but she did\nnot think they gave a copy to Krischer and Belohlavek. Neither Krischer nor Belohlavek expressed\nconcern about proceeding as the USAO was proposing. According to Villafafia, Belohlavek\nexplained that a plea to the three state counts identified in the draft NPA would affect the state’s\nsentencing guidelines, and that it would be beter for the guidelines calculation if Epstein pled\nguilty to just one of the three counts. Villafafia recalled that when Belohlavek confirmed that\nEpstein would be required to register as a sexual offender if he pled to any one of the three charges,\nLourie, speaking for the USAO, agreed to allou Epstein to enter his plea to just one state charge\nin addition to the pending state indictment, and the defense atorneys selected the charge of\nprocurement of minors to engage in prostitution.!°° Lourie, houever, disputed Villafafia’s\nrecollection that he made the final decision, stating that it was “illogical” to conclude that he had\nthe authority to change the terms of agreement unilaterally. ©’\n\nDuring the meeting, defense counsel raised concerns about Epstein serving time in state\nprison. Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie, the other supervisor, and she made clear during the\nmeeting that they expected Epstein to be incarcerated 24 hours a day, seven days a week, during\nthe entirety of his sentence, and they did not “particularly care” whether it was in a state or local\nfacility. Belohlavek explained to OPR that in order for Epstein to serve his time in a county\nfacility, rather than state prison, his sentence on each charge could be no more than l2 months, so\nthat, for example, consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months—totaling l8 months—could be\nserved in the county jail. Villafafia told OPR:\n\nOur thing was incarceration 24 hours a day. So during this meeting,\n\nI remember [the defense] talking about... a one year count folloued\n\nby a six-month count . .. that [Epstein] could serve them back to\n\nback but at the county jail, rather than having to go to a state facility.\n\nBut then I said, “But if you do that, it’s still going to have to be round\n\nthe clock incarceration.” And Barry Krischer said yes. And [he]\n\nsaid that to avoid [Epstein being extorted while incarcerated], he\n\nwould be kept in solitary confinement.\nVillafafia did not recall whether she and Lourie agreed to an l8-month sentence during that\nmeeting, but she told OPR that in her view, allouing Epstein to serve his sentence in the county\njail was not a “concession” because he would be incarcerated regardless.\n\nNeither Lourie nor the other USAO supervisor present could recall any substantive details\nof the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and Krischer and Belohlavek told OPR they did not remember\nthe meeting at all. Krischer did, houever, recall that he was “not offended at all” when he learned\nof the proposed federal <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, requiring Epstein to plead to both the pending state indictment\nand an additional charge requiring sexual offender registration, explaining to OPR that Epstein\n“was going to plead guilty to my indictment, we were going to add an additional charge, he was\nlo6 Later, the defense would claim that they had mistakenly understood that the selected charge would not\ninvolve sexual offender registration.\n\nlo7 As noted belou, a contemporaneous email indicates that shortly after the meeting, Lourie and Villafafia spoke\nwith Acosta and Sloman, who concurred with the agreement.\n65\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l265", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021266.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document E92 3536o38, Page94 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 92 of 348\ngoing to become a registered sex offender, and he was going to go actually do time—which he\nhadn’t done up to this point.” Krischer asked, ‘““Why would I turn that doun?” Krischer also noted\nthat at that time, sexual offender registration “was not the norm” in Florida, and he recognized that\n“it was clearly something that was important to the U.S. Atorney’s Office.” l°\n\nAcosta told OPR that he did not recall if he learned what transpired at the September l2\nmeeting, nor did he recall why the USAO team agreed to permit Epstein to plead guilty to only\none charge. Acosta told OPR, houever, that he recognized that Villafafia and Lourie needed “some\ndegree of discretion to negotiate”; that “in the give and take” of negotiations, they might propose\na concession; and he was comfortable with the concession as long as the charge to which Epstein\nultimately pled “captured the conduct” in an “appropriate” way.\n\nAlthough Epstein’s atorneys expressed interest in Epstein serving his time in a county\nfacility (rather than state prison), one of Epstein’s atorneys alternatively expressed interest in\nEpstein serving his time in a federal facility, and along with discussions about the possible state\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, the USAO and Epstein’s counsel also discussed a possible federal plea with a sentence\nrunning concurrently to the sentence Epstein would receive on the already indicted state charge.\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz an email advising that she and Lourie had talked with\nAcosta and Sloman, and they were “all satisfied in principle with the agreement.”'”’ The next day,\nSeptember l3, 2oo7, Villafafia sent an email to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and two other supervisors,\nidentifying potential federal offenses that would yield a two-year sentence. Villafafia also emailed\ndefense counsel, stating that she had been “spending some quality time with Title l8”—referring\nto the code of federal criminal statutes—to make sure there would be a “factual basis” for any\nfederal plea, and identifying the federal statutes she was considering.\n\nC. The Evidence Does Not Clearly Shou Why the Term of Incarceration Was\n\nReduced from 24 Months to 2o Months to l8 Months\n\nOPR reviewed the contemporaneous records and asked Acosta, Villafafia, and Lourie to\nexplain hou the jail term Epstein would have to accept came to be reduced from two years to l8\nmonths. Lourie had no recollection of the process through which the term of incarceration was\nreduced. Villafafia and Acosta offered significantly different explanations.\n\nVillafafia told OPR:\n\nWe had this flip flop between is it going to be a state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge, is it going to be [a] state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge? And to get to a federal charge, there\n\nwas no way to do 24 months that made any sense. So somehou it\n\nended up being 2o months and then it got to be l8 months. And\n\nthese were calls that if I remember correctly, Jay Lefkouitz was\nlo8 Belohlavek, houever, told OPR that sexual offender registration “was a common occurrence” for enumerated\nstate crimes, but the state crime charged in the state indictment against Epstein was not one of them.\nl9 The email does not indicate what the parties meant by “the agreement.”\n\n66\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l266", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021270.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document E96 3536o38, Page98 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 96 of 348\nevidence of a violation of the agreement. Epstein and his counsel\nagree that the computers that are currently under [legal process] will\nbe safeguarded in their current condition by Epstein’s counsel or\ntheir agents until the terms and conditions of the Agreement are\n\nfulfilled.\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a lengthy email to convey two options Lourie had\nsuggested: “the original proposal” for a state plea but with an agreement for an l8-month sentence,\nor pleas to state charges and two federal obstruction-of-justice charges. Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year conspiracy\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding recommendation for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\nsentenced in the state after he is sentenced in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be sentenced after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of all criminal liability, “and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she understood\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed.\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.'l3\n\nWith regard to immigration, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on immigration issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in connection with\ntheir immigration paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status. So there wasn’t any reason\nl3 OPR understood Villafafia’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry\ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to\ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l27o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021272.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, SA_o8 3536o38, Pageloo of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 98 of 348\nwe go that route, would you intend to make the deferred [sic] prosecution agreement public?”\nVillafafia replied that while a federal plea agreement would be part of the court file and publicly\naccessible, the NPA “would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would remain part\nof our case file. It probably would be subject to a FOIA [Freedom of Information Act] request,\nbut it is not something that we would distribute without compulsory process.”!!° Villafafia told\nOPR that she believed Epstein did not want the NPA to be made public because he “did not want\npeople to believe him to have commited a variety of crimes.” As she explained to OPR, Villafafia\nbelieved the NPA did not need to be disclosed in its entirety, but she anticipated notifying the\nvictims about the NPA provisions relating to their ability to recover damages.\nE. The Parties Appear to Reach Agreement on a Plea to Federal Charges\nNegotiations continued the next day, Tuesday, September l8, 2oo7. Responding to\nVillafafia’s revised draft of the NPA, Lefkouitz suggested that Epstein plead to one federal charge\nwith a l2-month sentence, folloued by one year of supervised release with a requirement for home\ndetention and two years of state probation, with the first six months of the state sentence to be\nserved under community control. Villafafia replied, “I knou that the U.S. Atorney will not go\nbelou l8 months of prison/jail time (and I would strongly oppose the suggestion).” Shortly\nthereafter, Villafafia emailed Acosta, Lourie, and the incoming West Palm Beach manager:\nHi all — I think that we may be near the end of our negotiations with\nMr. Epstein, and not because we have reached a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. As I\nmentioned yesterday, I spent about l2 hours over the weekend\ndrafting Informations, changing plea agreements, and writing\nfactual proffers. I was supposed to receive a draft agreement from\nthem yesterday, which never arrived. At that time, they were\nleaning touards pleading only to state charges and doing all of the\ntime in state custody.\nLate last night I talked to Jay Lefkouitz who asked about Epstein\npleading to two twelve-month federal charges with half of his jail\ntime being spent in home confinement pursuant to the guidelines. I\ntold him that I had no objection to that approach but, in the interest\nof full disclosure, I did not believe that Mr. Epstein would be eligible\nbecause he will not be in Zone A or B.'’ This morning Jay\nLefkouitz called and said that I was correct but, if we could get\nMr. Epstein doun to l4 months, then he thought he would be\neligible.\nMy response: have him plead to two separate Informations.

The Defense Rejects the Federal Plea Agreement, Returns to the NPA\n“State-Only” <span class=\"highlight\">Resolution</span>, and Begins Opposing the Sexual Offender\nRegistration Requirement\n\nAfter having spent days negotiating the federal charges to be included in a plea agreement,\nby the afternoon of September 2o, 2oo7, the defense rejected the federal plea option, and the parties\nresumed negotiations over the details of an NPA calling for Epstein to plead to only state charges.\nThrough multiple emails and atempts (some successful) to speak directly with Acosta and other\nsupervisors, defense atorneys vigorously fought the USAO’s insistence that Epstein plead to a\nstate charge requiring sexual offender registration.\n\nAfter receiving the federal plea agreement, Lefkouitz spoke with Villafafia. She reported\nto Acosta and Lourie that Lefkouitz told her the defense was “back to doing the state-charges-\nonly agreement” and wanted until the middle of the follouing week to work out the details, but\nthat she had told defense counsel that “we need a signed agreement by tomorrou [Friday] or we\nare [filing charges] on Tuesday.”\n\nLefkouitz emailed Villafafia about the draft NPA that she had sent to him, pointing out\nthat it called for a 2o-month jail sentence folloued by lo months of community control, rather than\nl8 months in jail and l2 under community control, and to ask if the USAO had “any flexibility”\non the § 2255 procedure. Villafafia responded:\n\nThe l8 and l2 has already been agreed to by our office, so that is\nnot a problem. On the issue about l8 [U.S.C. §] 2255, we seem to\nbe miles apart. Your most recent version not only had me binding\nthe girls to a trust fund administered by the state court, but also\npromising that they will give up their [§] 2255 rights.\n\nI reviewed the e-mail that I sent you on Sunday with the comments\non some of your other changes. In the context of a non-prosecution\nagreement, the office may be more willing to be specific about not\npursuing charges against others. Houever, as I stated on Sunday,\nthe Office cannot and will not bind Immigration.\n\nAlso, your timetable will need to move up significantly. As [State\nAtorney] Barry [Krischer] said in our meeting last week, his office\ncan put together a plea agreement, [and an] information, and get you\nall before the [state] judge on a change of plea within a day.\n\nVillafafia alerted Krischer that evening that negotiations were “not going very well” and\nthat defense counsel “changed their minds again, and they only want to plead to state charges, not\nconcurrent state and federal.” She added, “If we cannot reach ... an agreement, then I need to\n[charge] the case on Tuesday [September 25] and I will not budge from that date.”\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s report of her conversation with Lefkouitz about the defense\npreference for a “state-charges-only agreement,” Lourie alerted her that, “He wants to get out of\n[sexual offender] registration which we should not agree to.” Lourie emailed Acosta:\n\n78\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l278", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021279.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONS 3536o38, Pagelo7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo5 of 348\nI think Jay [Lefkouitz] will try to talk you out of a registrable\noffense. Regardless of the merits of his argument, in order to get us\ndoun in time they made us an offer that included pleading to an\noffense against a minor (encouraging a minor into prostitution) and\ntouted that we should be happy because it was registrable. For that\nreason alone, I don’t think we should consider allouing them to\ncome doun from their oun offer, either on this issue or on time of\n\nincarceration.\n\nLefkouitz atempted to reach Acosta that night, but Acosta directed Villafafia to return the\ncall, and told Lourie that he did not want to open “a backchannel” with defense counsel. Lourie\ninstructed Villafafia, “U can tell [JJay that [A]lex will not agree to a nonregistration offense.”\n\nOn the morning of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Acosta informing him\nthat “it looks like we will be [filing charges against] Mr. Epstein on Tuesday,” reporting that the\ncharging package was being reviewed by the West Palm Beach manager, and asking if anyone in\nthe Miami office needed to review it. Villafafia also alerted Lourie that she had spoken that\nmorning to Lefkouitz, who “was waffling” about Epstein pleading to a state charge that required\nsexual offender registration, and she noted that she would confer with Krischer and Belohlavek\n“to make sure the defense doesn’t try to do an end run.”\n\nThat same morning, Epstein atorney Sanchez, who had not been involved in negotiations\nfor several weeks, emailed Sloman, advising, “[I] want to finalize the plea deal and there is only\none issue outstanding and [I] do not believe that [A]lex has read all the defense submissions that\nwould assist in his determination on this point .. . [U]pon <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, we will be prepared to sign\nas soon as today.” From his out-of-toun vacation, Sloman forwarded the email to Acosta, who\nreplied, “Enjo[y] vacation. Working with [M]arie on this.” Sloman also forwarded Sanchez’s\nemail to Lourie and asked, “Do you knou what she’s talking about?” Lourie responded that\nSanchez “has not been in any negotiations. Don’t even engage with yet another cook.”\n\nJ. The USAO Agrees Not to Criminally Charge “Potential Co-Conspirators”\n\nLefkouitz, in the meantime, sent Villafafia a revised draft NPA that proposed an l8-month\nsentence in the county jail, folloued by l2 months of community control, and restored the\nprovision for a trust fund for disbursement to an agreed-upon list of individuals “who seek\nreimbursement by filing suit pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 2255.” This defense draft retained the\nprovision promising not to criminally charge Epstein’s four female assistants and unnamed\nemployees of the specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity, but also extended the provision to “any\npotential co-conspirators” for any criminal charge arising from the ongoing federal investigation.\nThis language had evolved from similar language that Villafafia had included in the USAO’s\nearlier proposed draft federal plea agreement.'?” Lefkouitz also again included the sentence\nl22 The language in the USAO’s draft federal plea agreement stated, “This agreement resolves the federal\ncriminal liability of the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any\ncriminal conduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO]....”\n\n79\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l279", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021281.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lo7 3536o38, Pagelo9 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo7 of 348\nfederal court. Sloman similarly said that he had the impression that the non-prosecution provision\nwas meant to protect named co-conspirators who were also victims, “in a sense,” of Epstein’s\nconduct. Although later press coverage of the Epstein case focused on Epstein’s connection to\nprominent figures and suggested that the non-prosecution provision protected these individuals,\nSloman told OPR that it never occurred to him that the reference to potential co-conspirators was\ndirected touard any of the high-profile individuals who were at the time or subsequently linked\nwith Epstein.!?° Acosta did not recall the provision or any discussions about it. He speculated\nthat if he read the non-prosecution provision, he likely assumed that Villafafia and Lourie had\n“thought this through” and “addressed it for a reason.” The West Palm Beach manager, who had\nonly limited involvement at this stage, told OPR that the provision was “highly unusual,” and he\nhad “no clue” why the USAO agreed to it.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had\nnot developed evidence of “any other potential co-conspirators. So, ... we wouldn’t be\nprosecuting anybody else, so why not include it? ... I just didn’t think that there was anybody\nthat it would cover.” She conceded, houever, that she “did not catch the fact that it could be read\nas broadly as people have since read it.”\n\nK. The USAO Rejects Defense Efforts to Eliminate the Sexual Offender\n\nRegistration Requirement\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, State Atorney Krischer informed\nVillafafia that Epstein’s counsel had contacted him and Epstein was ready to agree “to all the\nterms” of the NPA—except for sexual offender registration. According to Krischer, defense\ncounsel had proposed that registration be deferred, and that Epstein register only if state or federal\nlaw enforcement felt, at any point during his service of the sentence, that he needed to do so.\nKrischer noted that he had “reached out” to Acosta about this proposal but had not heard back\nfrom him. Villafafia responded, “I think Alex is calling you nou.” Villafafia told OPR that, to her\nknouledge, Acosta called Krischer to tell him that registration was not a negotiable term. !”°\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia emailed Krischer for information about the amount of “gain\ntime” Epstein would earn in state prison. Villafafia explained in her email that she wanted to\ninclude a provision in the NPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at least a certain\nnumber of days to make sure he doesn’t try to ‘convince’ someone with the Florida prison\nauthorities to let him out early.” Krischer responded that under the proposal as it then stood,\nEpstein would serve l5 months. He also told Villafafia that a plea to a registrable offense would\nnot prevent Epstein from serving his time “at the stockade”— the local minimum security detention\nfacility. !?”\nls Sloman also pointed out that the NPA was not a “global <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>” and other co-conspirators could have\nbeen prosecuted “by any other [U.S. Atorney’s] office in the country.”\n\nl28 Krischer told OPR that he did not recall meeting or having interactions with Acosta regarding the Epstein\ncase or any other mater.\nWa The State Atorney concluded his email: “Glad we could get this worked out for reasons I won’t put in\nwriting. After this is resolved I would love to buy you a cup at Starbucks and have a conversation.” Villafafia\nresponded, “Sounds great.” When asked about this exchange during her OPR interview, Villafafia said: “Everybody\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l28l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021282.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lo8 3536o38, Pagello of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo8 of 348\n\nAt some point that day, Acosta spoke with Lefkouitz by phone regarding the need for\nEpstein to plead to a registrable offense. Throughout the weekend, with Villafafia’s Monday\ndeadline looming, defense counsel pressed hard to eliminate the sexual offender requirement. On\nSaturday, September 22, 2oo7, Sanchez sent a series of emails to Lourie. In the first, she provided\ndetails from a press report about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty to\nchild sex abuse charges and was sentenced to a term of probation. She noted that she “spoke to\n[M]at [Menchel]” and asked Lourie to call her. Two hours later she sent Lourie a second, lengthy\nemail, strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against\nregistration [as a sexual offender] in this case.” In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been\na “miscommunication” during the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and that “we only agreed to the\nsolicitation with minors because we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was\nNOT registrable.” Sanchez complained that lifetime sexual offender registration was a “life\nsentence” that was “uncalled for,” “does not make sense,” and was “inappropriate” to impose\n“simply [because] the FBI wants it, in return for all there [sic] efforts.” She listed numerous\nreasons why Epstein should not have to register, including his lack of a prior record or history of\nsexual offenses; the lack of any danger of recidivism; the ease with which he could be “tracked”\nwithout registering; and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state\nregistration requirements. A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number to Lourie\n“in case you want to speak to him directly.”\n\nIn another email sent less than two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing again\nbecause “you are a very fair person. This <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> in the Epstein case is not reasonable. [I]t isa\nresult of a misunderstanding at a meeting.” She stated that Epstein’s atorneys had “consistently\nemphasized their goal of l8 months in a federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable\noffense precluded” a camp designation. Sanchez added, “Therefore it would have been wholly\ninconsistent with that primary goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration at that\nmeeting.” Sanchez concluded, “[I]mposing a life sentence on him is not something anyone will\neventually be proud of. Please reconsider and help me get a fair result.”\n\nLourie responded to none of the Sanchez emails, but he did reach out to Acosta for a phone\nconversation. By email late that night, at lo:26 p.m., Lefkouitz asked Lourie to phone him.\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia—\nto “follou up on our conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement that\nEpstein plead to a registrable offense. Lefkouitz wrote that there had been a “misunderstanding”\nat the September l2, 2oo7 meeting:\n\nBefore the meeting, Mr. Krischer and Ms. Belohlavek, a sex\n\nprosecutor for l3 years, told us that solicitation of a minor... is not\n\naregisterable offense. Houever, as it turned out, [it] is a registerable\n\noffense and our discussion at the meeting was based on a mistaken\n\nassumption. We suggest that Mr. Epstein enter two pleas—one to\n\nthe Indictment and a second to a non-registerable charge.\nhas offered to buy me a cup of coffee. I have had coffee with no one.” Krischer told OPR that the “reasons” to which\nhe referred related to the pressure he had been geting from Chief Reiter about the Epstein case.\n\n82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l282", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021284.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONTOS 3536o38, Pagell2 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page llo of 348\nThe parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part of\nany public record.

SEPTEMBER 24, 2oo7; ACOSTA MAKES FINAL EDITS, AND THE NPA IS\n\nSIGNED\n\nThe contemporaneous emails shou that Villafafia continued to update Acosta as the parties\nnegotiated the final language and that Acosta reviewed and edited the NPA. Shortly after midnight\non Monday, September 24, 2oo7, Acosta sent Villafafia “[s]mall edits” to the “final” NPA she had\nsent to him. Among his changes was language modifying provisions that appeared to require the\nState Atorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein\nenter his guilty plea by a certain date. Acosta explained in his email, “I’m not comfortable with\nrequiring the State Atorney to enter into a [joint sentencing] recommendation” or “requiring a\nState court to stick with our timeline” for entry of the guilty plea and sentencing. Accordingly,\nAcosta substituted language that required Epstein alone to make a binding sentencing\nrecommendation to the state court, and required Epstein to use his “best efforts” to enter his guilty\nplea and be sentenced by the specified dates. Acosta also instructed Villafafia to restore a reference\nto Epstein’s wish “to reach a global <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of his state and federal criminal liabilities.” Lourie,\nwho had returned to the Department in Washington, D.C., had a phone conversation with\nLefkouitz and sent additional comments on the final draft to Acosta and Villafafia. Villafafia sent\na new revision, incorporating edits from Acosta and Lourie, to Lefkouitz later that morning.\n\nOn the afternoon of September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia circulated the new “final” version of\nthe NPA to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other supervisors, and asked Lefkouitz to send her the\nsigned agreement. After Lefkouitz electronically transmited to Villafafia a copy of the NPA\nsigned by Epstein, she emailed her immediate supervisor and her co-counsel: “They have scanned.\nand emailed the signed agreement. It is done.”\n\nIn his transmital email, Lefkouitz asked Villafafia to “[p]lease do whatever you can to\nkeep this from becoming public.” Villafafia responded:\n\nI have forwarded your message only to Alex, Andy, and [the West\n\nPalm Beach manager]. I don’t anticipate it going any further than\n\nthat. When I receive the originals, I will sign and return one copy\n\nto you. The other will be placed in the case file, which will be kept\n\nconfidential since it also contains identifying information about the\n\ngirls.\n\nWhen we reach an agreement about the atorney representative for\n\nthe girls, we can discuss what I can tell him and the girls about the\nl28 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Lourie observed that because the NPA contained names of uncharged\nco-conspirators and other protected information, the USAO would have a duty to redact the information before\ndisclosing the NPA.\n\n84\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l284", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021285.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OTT 3536o38, Pagell3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 348\nagreement. I knou that Andy promised Chief Reiter an update when\na <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> was achieved....

[He] also is telling Chief\n\nReiter not to disclose the outcome to anyone.\n\nOPR questioned Villafafia about this email. She explained that she generally kept\nconfidential the terms of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of any case. She understood that “the way that the [Epstein]\ncase was resolved” needed to remain confidential, but the victims could be informed about what\nhappened because by the NPA’s terms, they needed to knou what the agreement was about.\n\nVillafafia emailed the West Palm Beach manager, asking him to tell PBPD Chief Reiter\n“the good news” but “leave out the part about damages,” and explained that she wanted to meet\nwith the victims herself to explain hou the damages provision would work. Villafafia also told\nhim that Lourie had asked that Reiter share information about the NPA only with the PBPD\nDetective who had led the state investigation of Epstein.’ Villafafia forwarded to Acosta, Lourie,\nand the West Palm Beach manager Lefkouitz’s email asking that the USAO try to keep the NPA\nfrom becoming public. Acosta responded that the agreement “already binds us not to make public\nexcept as required by law under [the Freedom of Information Act],” and asked, “[W]hat more does\nhe want?” Villafafia replied, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief or FBI\nor the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.” Soon thereafter, Acosta emailed Lourie, Villafafia,\nand the West Palm Beach manager to set up a call to discuss “who we tell and hou much,” adding,\n“Nice job with a difficult negotiation.”\n\nThe final NPA, as signed by Epstein, his atorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez, and Villafafia,\ncontained the follouing pertinent provisions:\n\nCharges: Epstein would plead guilty to the pending Palm Beach County indictment,\n\nplus one count of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution, a\nregistrable offense.\n\nSentence: The parties would make a joint, binding recommendation for a 3o-month\nsentence divided as follous: consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months\nin the county jail, without opportunity for withholding adjudication or\nsentencing and without community control or probation, folloued by\nl2 months of community control, consecutive. !°°\n\nDamages: As long as the identified victims proceeded exclusively under l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255, Epstein would not contest federal court jurisdiction or the victims’\nstatus as victims. The USAO would provide to Epstein a list of individuals\n\nie The West Palm Beach manager told OPR that he called Chief Reiter, who was “fine” with the outcome.\nl3o Withholding adjudication or sentencing referred to a special sentence in which the judge orders probation\nbut does not formally convict the defendant of a criminal offense.

More importantly, Lefkouitz used the\ndiscussion of the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the\nNPA or, at least, to its interpretation. Focusing on the atorney representative, Lefkouitz argued\nthat the atorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating setlements and that the atorney\nwas precluded from filing lawsuits on behalf of victims who could not reach a negotiated\nsetlement with Epstein. Lefkouitz proposed:\n\n[T]he selected atorney should evaluate the claims of each identified\n\nindividual, negotiate a total fund amount with Mr. Epstein, then\n\ndistribute the monies based on the strength of each case. For those\n\nidentified individuals who elect not to setle with Mr. Epstein, they\n\nmay proceed on their oun, but by doing so, they would not be suing\n\nunder § 2255 as contemplated by [the NPA] and therefore may not\n\ncontinue to be represented by the selected atorney.\nLefkouitz also objected to Villafafia’s draft leter to the special master, asserting that it was\nessential for the defense to participate in crafting a “mutually acceptable communication” to the\nvictims. Going further, Lefkouitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims\nabout the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision. Lefkouitz\nadmonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the\ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected atorney and the setlement process.”\n\nVillafafia forwarded Lefkouitz’s leter to Sloman, complaining that the defense\ninterpretation of the § 2255 procedure violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I\nplease just indict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follou-up\nleter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the atorney representative’s role, and\narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’\ncivil lawsuits in the event a setlement could not be reached. When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez]. The more ‘voices’ they hear the more wedges they try to drive\nbetween us.” Villafafia agreed, noting that “[t]here are so many of them over there, I am afraid we\nare geting triple-teamed.”!%°\n\nVillafafia sent Sanchez a leter regarding the roles of the special master and atorney\nrepresentative. The next day, October lo, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent a six-page leter to Acosta, asa\n“follou up to our conversation yesterday,” expressing “serious disagreements” with Villafafia’s\nview of the process for victims to claim § 2255 damages under the NPA. Lefkouitz reiterated the\ndefense position that the atorney representative’s role was meant to be limited to negotiating\nsetlements for the victims, rather than pursuing litigation. Lefkouitz claimed that a requirement\nl36 Villafafia also alerted Sloman that a newspaper was reporting that defense counsel was writing a leter to\nAcosta asking for reconsideration of the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender. Villafafia commented,\n“Tt appears they don’t understand that a signed contract is binding.”\n\n88\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l288", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021289.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ATIS 3536o38, Pagell7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll5 of 348\nthat Epstein pay the victims’ legal fees incurred from contested litigation would “trigger profound\nethical problems,” in that the atorney representative would have an incentive to reject setlement\noffers in order to incur more fees. In addition, Lefkouitz rejected Villafafia’s view that Epstein\nhad waived the right to challenge § 2255 liability as to victims who did not want to setle their\nclaims, and contended that any such victims “will have to prove, among other things, that they are\nvictims under the enumerated statutes.” Finally, Lefkouitz again argued that the USAO should\nnot discuss the setlement process with the victims who were to be identified as eligible for\nsetlement under § 2255:\nMs. Villafafia proposes that either she or federal agents will speak\nwith the [victims] regarding the setlement process. We do not think\nit is the government’s place to be co-counsel to the [victims], nor\nshould the FBI be their personal investigators. Neither federal\nagents nor anyone from your Office should contact the [victims] to\ninform them of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the case, including appointment of\nthe atorney representative and the setlement process. Not only\nwould that violate the confidentiality of the Agreement, but\nMr. Epstein also will have no control over what is communicated to\nthe [victims] at this most critical stage. We believe it is essential\nthat we participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication\nto the [victims]. We further believe that communications between\nyour Office or your case agents and the [victims] might well violate\nRule 6(e)(2)(B) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The\npouers of the federal grand jury should not, even in appearance, be\nutilized to advance the interests of a party to a civil lawsuit.’\nLefkouitz concluded, “I look forward to resolving these open issues with you during our 4:3o call\ntoday.” 38\nVillafafia was at that time on sick leave, and Sloman and Acosta exchanged emails about\ncrafting an addendum to the NPA to address the method of appointing an atorney representative\nand to articulate the representative’s duties. The next day, October ll, 2oo7, Sloman exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz about the text of a proposed addendum.\nB. October l2, 2oo7: Acosta and Defense Atorney Lefkouitz Meet for Breakfast\nOn the morning after his scheduled afternoon phone call with Lefkouitz, Acosta exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, arranging to meet for breakfast the follouing day, on October l2, 2oo7, at\na Marriot hotel in West Palm Beach.

'”\n\nOn November 28, 2oo7, Starr requested, by leter, a meeting with Fisher. In his leter, Starr\nargued that the USAO improperly had compelled Epstein to agree to pay civil damages under\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 as part of a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> ofa criminal case. On the same day, Lefkouitz\nemailed Sloman, complaining about the USAO’s plan to notify victims about the § 2255 provision\nand alerting Sloman that Epstein’s counsel were seeking a meeting with the Assistant Atorney\nGeneral “to address what we believe is the unprecedented nature of the section 2255 component”\nof the NPA. After Lourie sent to Sloman a copy of the Starr leter, Sloman forwarded it to\nVillafafia, asking her to prepare a chronology of the plea negotiations and hou the § 2255 provision\nevolved. Villafafia responded that she was “going through all of the ways in which they have tried\nto breach the agreement to convince you guys to let me indict.”\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Lourie consulted with CEOS Chief Oosterban, asking for his\nthoughts on defense counsel’s arguments. At the same time, at Lourie’s request, Villafafia sent\nthe NPA and its addendum to Lourie and Oosterban. Oosterban responded to Lourie that he was\n“not thrilled” about the NPA; described Epstein’s conduct as unusually “egregious,” particularly\nbecause of its serial nature; and observed that the NPA was “prety advantageous for the defendant\nand not all that helpful to the victims.” He opined, houever, that the Assistant Atorney General\nwould not and should not consider or address the NPA “other than to say that she agrees with it.”\nDuring her OPR interview, Fisher did not recall reading Starr’s leter or discussing it with\nOosterban, but believed the comment about her “agree[ing] with it” referred to a federal\nprosecution of Epstein, which she believed was appropriate. She told OPR, houever, that she\n“olayed no role in” the NPA and did not review or approve the agreement either before or after it\nwas signed.\n\nAs set forth in more detail in Chapter Three of this Report, Villafafia planned to notify the\nvictims about the NPA and its § 2255 provision, as well as about the state plea hearing, and she\nprovided a draft of the notification leter to Lefkouitz for comments. On November 29, 2oo7,\nLefkouitz sent Acosta a leter complaining about the draft notification to the victims. Lefkouitz\nasked the USAO to refrain from notifying the victims until after defense counsel met with Assistant\nAtorney General Fisher, which he anticipated would take place the follouing week. Internal\nemails indicate that Lourie contacted Oosterban about his availability for a meeting with Starr,\nbut both Fisher and Lourie told OPR that such a meeting never took place, and OPR found no\nevidence that it did.\n\nAcosta promptly responded to Lefkouitz by leter, directing him to raise his concerns about\nvictim notification with Villafafia or Sloman. Acosta also addressed Epstein’s evident efforts to\nstop the NPA from being enforced:\n\nIs In a short email to Fisher, the next day, Lourie reported simply: “He was very nice.

Under this\nAgreement, this District has agreed to defer prosecution for\nenumerated sections of Title l8 in favor of prosecution by the State\nof Florida, provided ... Mr. Epstein satisfies three general federal\ninterests: (l) that Mr. Epstein plead guilty to a “registerable”\noffense; (2) that this plea include a binding recommendation for a\nsufficient term of imprisonment; and (3) that the Agreement not\nharm the interests of his victims.\n\nAcosta explained in the leter that the USAO’s intent was “to place the identified victims\nin the same position as they would have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more;\nno less.” Acosta documented the USAO’s understanding of the operation of the NPA’s § 2255\nl83 The USAO may have been asked to respond because Starr’s leter raised issues that had not been previously\nraised with the USAO, and it would normally fall to the USAO to address them in the first instance.\n\n96\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l296", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021297.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l33 3536o38, Pagel25 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l23 of 348\nprovision, recounted the history of NPA negotiations, and described the post-signing efforts by\nEpstein’s counsel to challenge portions of the NPA. Acosta’s leter concluded:\nAlthough it happens rarely, I do not mind this Office’s decision\nbeing appealed to Washington, and have previously directed our\nprosecutors to delay filings in this case to provide defense counsel\nwith the option of appealing our decisions. Indeed, although I am\nconfident in our prosecutors’ evidence and legal analysis, I\nnonetheless directed them to consult with the subject mater experts\nin [CEOS] to confirm our interpretation of the law before approving\ntheir [charges]. I am thus surprised to read a leter addressed to\nDepartment Headquarters that raises issues that either have not been\nraised with this Office previously or that have been raised, and in\nfact resolved, in your client’s favor.\nI am troubled, likewise, by the apparent lack of finality in this\nAgreement. The AUSAs who have been negotiating with defense\ncounsel have for some time complained to me regarding the tactics\nused by the defense team. It appears to them that as soon as\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> is reached on one issue, defense counsel finds ways to\nchallenge the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> collaterally. My response thus far has been\nthat defense counsel is doing its job to vigorously represent the\nclient. That said, there must be closure on this mater. Some in our\nOffice are deeply concerned that defense counsel will continue to\nmount collateral challenges to provisions of the Agreement, even\nafter Mr. Epstein has entered his guilty plea and thus rendered the\nagreement difficult, if not impossible, to unwind.\nI would reiterate that it is not the intention of this Office ever to force\nthe hand of a defendant to enter into an agreement against his\nwishes. Your client has the right to proceed to trial. Although time\nis of the essence .. . I am directing our prosecutors not to issue\nvictim notification leters until this Friday ... to provide you with\ntime to review these options with your client... . We expect a\nwriten decision by [December 7, 2oo7] at 5 p.m., indicating\nwhether the defense team wishes to reaffirm, or to unwind, the\nAgreement.\n\nAcosta explained to OPR that he did not view his leter as “inviting” Departmental review,\nbut he believed the Department had the “right” to address Epstein’s concerns. Moreover, the\nUSAO’s only option at that time was to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA, which would have\nprompted litigation as to whether Epstein was, in fact, in breach. Acosta noted that defense counsel\nrepeatedly proclaimed Epstein’s intent to abide by the agreement, making any USAO effort to\ndeclare him in breach more difficult. In fact, the day after receiving Acosta’s leter, Starr and\nLefkouitz responded to Acosta (with copies to Sloman and Assitant Atorney General Fisher) that\n\n97\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l297", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021300.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l6 3536o38, Pagel28 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l26 of 348\n4. Acosta Atempts to Revise the NPA § 2255 Language concerning\nMonetary Damages, but the Defense Does Not Accept It\nAcosta undertook to respond to defense counsel’s continuing concern about the § 2255\nprovision. He sent to Deputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal Mandelker language that he\nproposed including in a revision to the NPA’s § 2255 implementation section. Mandelker\nforwarded the language to her counterpart in the Crvil Division, who responded to Mandelker and\nAcosta that he did not have “any insight” to offer. On December l9, 2oo7, after Acosta and\nSloman had a phone conversation with Starr and Lefkouitz, Acosta sent to Sanchez a leter\nproposing to resolve “our disagreements over interpretation[]” by replacing the existing language\nof the NPA relating to § 2255 with a provision that would read:\nAny person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an\noffense enumerated in Title l8, United States Code, Section 2255,\nwill have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she\nwould have had, if Mr. Epstein [had] been tried federally and\nconvicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing\nthis paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s\natorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to\nname... as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any\njudicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority\ndetermining which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet,\nshall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these\nidentified victims in the same position as they would have been had\nMr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.\n\nAcosta also noted that he had resisted his prosecutors’ urging to declare the NPA breached by the\n\ndefense delays.!°’\n\nLefkouitz responded by leter a few days later, suggesting that Acosta’s proposal raised\n“several troubling questions” and that “the problem arises from the incongruity that exists when\natempting to fit a federal civil remedies statute into a criminal plea agreement.”!°* In a follou-up\nleter to Acosta, to address the USAO’s concern that Epstein was intentionally delaying the entry\nof his guilty plea, Lefkouitz asserted that “any impediment to the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> at issue is a direct\ncause of the disagreements between the parties,” and that defense counsel had “at all times made\nand will continue to make sincere efforts to resolve and finalize issues as expeditiously as\npossible.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that despite this assurance from defense counsel, he was “increasingly\nfrustrated” by Epstein’s desire to take an “llth hour appeal” to the Department so soon before the\nou As described in detail in Chapter Three, Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter also addressed defense objections\nto notifying the victims about the NPA and the state plea.\n\nl58 After Starr and Lefkouitz had another conversation with Acosta and Sloman, Lefkouitz sent a second leter\nto Acosta reiterating concerns with the § 2255 provision and asserting that the provision was “inherently flawed and\nbecoming truly unmanageable.” In the end, the defense team rejected Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 NPA modification\nleter.\nloo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3oo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021301.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel29 of 258\nSA-l27\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l27 of 348\n\nscheduled January 4, 2oo8 plea hearing. As soon became apparent, Acosta was unable to achieve\nan expedited review so that Epstein could plead guilty and be sentenced by\nJanuary 4, 2oo8, and the plea and sentencing date was rescheduled. On January 2, 2oo8, Sloman\nspoke with Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek, who confirmed that the change of plea hearing\nhad been postponed. In an email reporting this to Acosta and Villafafia, Sloman said that Epstein’s\nlocal defense atorney Goldberger had told Belohlavek the postponement was because the facts\n“did not fit the proposed state charge,” and that Belohlavek told Sloman she agreed with that\nassessment.’°? The next day, Villafafia sent to Acosta and Sloman a local newspaper article\nreporting that Epstein’s state plea hearing was reset for March and in exchange for it the federal\nauthorities would drop their investigation of him. Acosta also sent to Sloman and Villafafia an\nemail memorializing a statement made to him by Lefkouitz in a phone call that day: “‘I\n[Lefkouitz] may have made a mistake 6 months ago. [Belohlavek] told us solicitation [is] not\nregistrable. It turns out that the actual offense charged is.’”!°°\n\n5. January 7, 2oo8: Acosta and Sloman Meet with Sanchez, Who Makes\n\nAdditional Allegations of USAO Misconduct\n\nOn January 7, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman met with defense atorney Sanchez at her request.\nAccording to meeting notes made by Sloman, among other things, Sanchez alleged that the\nUSAO’s media spokesperson had improperly disclosed details of the Epstein case to a national\nnews reporter, and Sanchez “suggested that the USAO could avoid any potential ugliness in DC\nby agreeing to a watered-doun <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> for Epstein.” After Acosta excused himself to atend\nanother meeting and Sloman refused to speak further with Sanchez “without a witness present,”\nshe left. Later that day, Acosta and Sloman spoke by phone with Starr, Lefkouitz, and Sanchez,\nwho expressed concern about the “leak” to the news media, reiterated their objections to the NPA,\nand pressed for the “watered-doun <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>,” which they specified would mean allouing Epstein\nto plead to a charge of coercion instead of procurement, avoid serving time in jail, and not register\nas a sexual offender. A note in the margin of Sloman’s handwriten notes of the conversation\nreads: “We’re back to where we started in September.”\n\nThat evening, Villafafia expressed concern that the delay in resolving the mater was\naffecting the USAO’s ability to go forward with a prosecution should Epstein renege on his\nagreement, and she outlined for Acosta and Sloman the steps she proposed to take while Epstein\nwas pursuing Departmental review. Those steps included re-establishing contact with victims,\ninterviewing victims in New York and one victim who lived in a foreign country, making contact\nwith “potential sources of information” in the Virgin Islands, and re-initiating proceedings to\nobtain Epstein’s computers.\n\nIn the meantime, USAO Criminal Division Chief Robert Senior performed a “soup to nuts”\nreview of the Epstein investigation, reviewing the indictment package and all of the evidence\nVillafafia had compiled. He told OPR that he could not recall the reason for his review, but opined\noO Belohlavek told OPR that she did not recall this incident, but she noted that the PBPD report did set forth\nfacts supporting the charge of procurement of a minor.\n\nl6o Although the meeting Lefkouitz had with Lourie, Villafafia, Krischer, and Belohlavek to discuss the state\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> was only four months prior, not six, Lefkouitz’s reference was likely to the September l2, 2oo7 meeting.\nlol\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3ol", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021309.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONE 3536o38, Pagel37 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l35 of 348\nDivision forwarded to Roth the prior defense submissions, describing them as “an enormous\namount of material” regarding the Epstein mater. On June 3, 2oo8, Sloman sent to Roth a lengthy\nleter from Sloman to the Deputy Atorney General, recounting in detail the history of negotiations\nwith Epstein’s counsel culminating in the NPA, and addressing Epstein’s claims of professional\nmisconduct.

Follouing the office’s standard protocol, Starr’s leter was handled by John Roth,\nan experienced senior federal prosecutor who had served some years before as an AUSA in the\nUSAO. Roth also told OPR that he had never before heard of Epstein. Roth explained to OPR\nthat he did not conduct an independent investigation, interview witnesses, or meet with Epstein’s\ncounsel, and instead limited his review to writen materials submited by Epstein’s atorneys and\nby Sloman to the Deputy Atorney General’s office, as well as materials that the defense team and\nthe USAO had previously provided to CEOS and the Criminal Division front office, and that\nCEOS furnished to him. Roth discussed the mater with two senior staff colleagues, as well as\nwith the Deputy Atorney General, who also reviewed the submissions.\n\nRoth told OPR that it was his understanding that Epstein had reneged on the NPA, and\nbecause he believed the NPA was a “dead leter,” he did not review the terms of the agreement or\nratify it post hoc. On the other hand, Deputy Atorney General Filip told OPR he understood that\nthe NPA was still in effect and that Epstein was trying to undermine the federal jurisdictional basis\nfor the agreement. Apart from addressing Epstein’s federalism arguments, houever, Deputy\nAtorney General Filip did not believe it was the “mission” of the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral to review the Epstein case de novo or to examine the NPA’s terms or determine whether\nthe NPA reached the “right balance” between state and federal punishment. He told OPR, “[W]e\nheard an appeal... . [Epstein] wanted a meeting to argue for relief. We didn’t give him a meeting\nand we didn’t give him [any] relief’ Deputy Atorney General Filip told OPR that no one in his\noffice who looked at Epstein’s arguments “felt that it was a sympathetic appeal.” In particular, he\ntold OPR that defense counsel’s argument that there was no basis for a federal prosecution was\n“ludicrous,” and the assertion that the USAO’s investigation of Epstein was politically motivated\n“Tust seemed unserious.”\n\nTi Villafafia urged Sloman, “Someone really needs to talk to Barry.”\nlo9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3o9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021310.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel38 of 258\nSA-l36\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l36 of 348\n\nOn Monday, June 23, 2oo8, Roth sent a brief leter to Starr and Lefkouitz informing them\nthat the office had “completed a thorough review” of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater\nand did not believe intervention by the Deputy Atorney General was warranted in view of the\n“considerable discretion” vested by the Department in U.S. Atorneys. He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being sentenced, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence. On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls. Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try\nto take a further appeal in order to delay <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknouledging they had reached “the\nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While I am obviously very unhappy at what I believe\nis the government’s treatment of my client, aman whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize\nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost....

After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.”'”\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\nie The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

Nothing in the text of that rule,\nhouever, was relevant to the issues addressed in this Report. A comment to FRPC Rule 4-3.8 notes that Florida has\nadopted the American Bar Association (ABA) Standards of Criminal Justice Relating to the Prosecution Function.\nThese “standards,” houever, are not binding rules of conduct but rather provide guidance to prosecutors. Indeed, the\nABA has expressly stated that these standards “are not intended to serve as the basis for the imposition of professional\ndiscipline, to create substantive or procedural rights for accused or convicted persons, to create a standard of care for\ncivil liability, or to serve as a predicate for a motion to suppress evidence or dismiss a charge.” OPR does not consider\nthe ABA standards as binding on the conduct of Department prosecutors.\n\nl3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l33l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021333.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l59 | 3536o38, Pagel6l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l59 of 348\nCHAPTER TWO\nPART THREE: ANALYSIS\n\nI. OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. As a result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconcerning the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nI. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, two years ..., registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority... . [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, I... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l333", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021334.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 6o. 3536o38, Pagel62 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6o of 348\ndifferent points in time, and regarding different decisions. Menchel, for example, participated in\nformulating the USAO’s initial writen offer to the defense, but he had no involvement with actions\nor decisions made after August 3, 2oo7. Sloman was absent during part of the most intense\nnegotiations in September 2oo7 and did not see the final, signed version of the NPA until he\nreturned. Villafafia and Lourie participated in the negotiations, and Lourie either made decisions\nduring the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the defense and State Atorney’s Office, or at least\nindicated agreement pending Acosta’s approval. In any event, whatever the level of Sloman’s,\n\nMenchel’s, Lourie’s, and Villafafia’s involvement, they acted with the knouledge and approval of\n\nAcosta.\n\nUnder OPR’s analytical framework, an atorney who makes a good faith atempt to\nascertain the obligations and standards imposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given\nsituation does not commit professional misconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith\natempt to ascertain and comply with the obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not\nlimited to, the fact that the atorney consulted with a supervisor.”’ In this regard, OPR’s\nframework is similar to a standard provision of the professional conduct rules of most state bars,\nwhich specify that a subordinate lawyer does not engage in misconduct if that lawyer acts in\naccordance with a supervisory lawyer’s reasonable <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of an arguable question of\nprofessional duty. See, e.g., FRPC 4-5.2(b). Therefore, in addition to the fact that OPR did not\nfind a violation of a clear and unambiguous standard as discussed belou, OPR concludes that\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia did not commit professional misconduct with respect to\nany aspect of the NPA because they acted under Acosta’s direction and with his approval.\n\nI. OPR FOUND THAT NONE OF THE SUBJECTS VIOLATED A CLEAR AND\nUNAMBIGUOUS STATUTE, PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY RULE OR\nSTANDARD, OR DEPARTMENT REGULATION OR POLICY, IN\nNEGOTIATING, APPROVING, OR ENTERING INTO THE NPA\nA central issue OPR addressed in its investigation relating to the NPA was whether any of\n\nthe subjects, in developing, negotiating, or entering into the NPA, violated any clear and\n\nunambiguous standard established by rule, regulation, or policy. OPR does not find professional\nmisconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous\nstandard. OPR considered three specific areas: (l) standards implicated by the decision to decline\n\na federal court prosecution; (2) standards implicated by the decision to resolve the federal\n\ninvestigation through a non-prosecution agreement; and (3) standards implicated by any of the\n\nNPA’s provisions, including the promise not to prosecute unidentified third parties. As discussed\n\nbelou, OPR concludes that in each area, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his\n\ndecisions were based on corrupt or improper influences, the U.S. Atorney possessed broad\ndiscretionary authority to proceed as he saw fit, authority that he could delegate to subordinates,\nand that Acosta’s exercise of his discretionary authority did not breach any clear and unambiguous\nstandard. As a result, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\n\n2o2 The failure to fully advise a supervisor of relevant and material facts can warrant a finding that the subordinate\n\natorney has not acted in “good faith.” OPR did not find evidence supporting such a conclusion here, and Acosta did\n\nnot claim that he was unaware of material facts needed to make his decision.\n\nl34\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l334", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021337.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONG 3536o38, Pagel65 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l63 of 348\nagreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>.?°°\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o8 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villatafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l337", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021340.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ANG6G 3536o38, Pagel68 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l66 of 348\n3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Tall deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafafia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l34o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021343.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l69 3536o38, Pagel7l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l69 of 348\n\nnarrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.?’” The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?”°\n\n2. The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by Reasonable\n\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\n\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natorneys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at .. . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.7‘4 OPR also\n2l2 In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have joined with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l343", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021346.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel74 of 258\nSA-l72\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l72 of 348\nrecord, no restitution, no sex offender status, publication at a trial of\nthe names of certain victims that didn’t want their names revealed\nand the general difficulties of a trial for the victims and their\nfamilies.\n\nAlthough his emails shoued that, at the time, he advocated for prosecution of Epstein,\nLourie told OPR it was also his general recollection that “everybody at the USAO working on the\nmater had expressed concerns at various times about the long-term viability of a federal\nprosecution of Epstein due to certain factual and legal hurdles, as well as issues with the\ncooperation and desires of the victims.”\n\nSimilarly, Menchel—who had experience prosecuting sexual assault crimes—recalled\nunderstanding that many of the victims were unwilling to go forward and would have experienced\nadditional trauma as a result of a trial, and some had made statements exonerating Epstein.\nMenchel told OPR he believed that if the USAO had filed the proposed charges against Epstein,\nEpstein would have elected to go to trial. In Menchel’s view, the USAO therefore had to weigh\nthe risk of losing at trial, and thereby re-traumatizing the victims, against the benefits gained\nthrough a negotiated result, which ensured that Epstein served time in jail, registered as a sexual\noffender, and made restitution to his victims.\n\nSloman also recalled witness challenges and concerns about the viability of the\ngovernment’s legal theories. He told OPR:\n\n[I]t seemed to me you had a tranche of witnesses who were not going\nto be reliable. You had a tranche [of] witnesses who were going to\nbe severely impeached. People who loved Jeffrey Epstein who\nthought he was a Svengali... who were going to say I told him I\nwas l8 years old.\n\nYou had witnesses who were scared to death of the public light\nbeing shoun on them because their parents didn’t even knou -- had\nvery vulnerable victims. You had all of these concerns.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he recalled discussions with his senior managers about the victims’\ngeneral credibility and reluctance to testify and the evidentiary strength of the case, all of which\nfactored into the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. He acknouledged that his understanding of the facts was not\n“oranular” and did not encompass a detailed understanding of each victim’s expected testimony,\nbut he trusted that his “team” had already “done the diligence necessary” to make\nrecommendations about the evidentiary strength of the case. Acosta recalled discussing the facts\nwith Sloman and Menchel, and possibly Lourie, none of whom had as detailed an understanding\nof the facts as Villafafia. Nevertheless, OPR credits Acosta’s statement that he reasonably\nbelieved, based on his conversations with others who expressed this view, that a trial would pose\nsignificant evidentiary challenges.\n\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony regarding witness challenges,\nincluding the FBI co-case agent, who recalled during his OPR interview that some of the victims\nhad expressed concern for their safety and ‘“‘a lot of them d[id]n’t want to take the stand, and\n\nl46\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l346", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021348.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONT 3536o38, Pagel76 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l74 of 348\n\nThe USAO might have been able to surmount the evidentiary, legal, and policy issues\npresented by a federal prosecution of Epstein.

Oosterban and others also believed that the\ngovernment would succeed at trial. Furthermore, the victims were not a uniform group. Some of\nthem were afraid of testifying or having their identities made public; others wanted Epstein\nprosecuted, but even among those, it is not clear hou many expressed a willingness to testify at a\ntrial; and still others provided information favorable to Epstein. In the end, Acosta assumed\nresponsibility for deciding hou to resolve the Epstein investigation and weighing the risks and\nbenefits of a trial versus those of a pre-charge disposition. His determination that a pre-charge\ndisposition was appropriate was not unreasonable under the circumstances.\n\nAlthough evidentiary and witness issues explain the subject supervisors’ concerns about\nwinning a potential trial and why the USAO would have sought some sort of pre-charge\ndisposition, they do not fully explain why Acosta decided to pursue a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> as\nopposed to a traditional federal plea agreement. OPR did not find in the contemporaneous records\na memorandum or other memorialization of the reasoning underlying Acosta’s decision to offer a\nstate-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> or the terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7.\n\nAccording to Acosta, “In 2oo6, it would have been extremely unusual for any United States\nAtorney’s Office to become involved in a state solicitation case, even one involving underage\nteens,” because solicitation was “the province of state prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR that he\ndeveloped “a preference for deferring to the state” to “make it clear that [the USAO was] not\nstepping on something that is a purely local mater, because we [didn’t] want bad precedent for\nthe sake of the larger human trafficking issue.” Acosta also told OPR that it was his understanding\nthat the PBPD would not have brought the case to federal investigators if the State Atorney’s\nOffice had pursued a sanction against Epstein that included jail time and sexual offender\nregistration. Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in the case as limited to preventing the “manifest\ninjustice” that, in Acosta’s view, would have resulted from the state’s original plea proposal.\nAcosta acknouledged that if the investigation had begun in the federal system, he would not have\nviewed the terms set out in the NPA as a satisfactory result, but it was adequate to serve as a\n“backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he described as “a polite way of saying[,\n‘|encouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]” In sum, Acosta told OPR that the Epstein case\nlay in “uncharted territory,” there was no certainty that the USAO would prevail if it went to trial,\nand a potentially unfavorable outcome had to be “weighed against a certain plea with registration\nthat would make sure that the public knew that this person was a sex offender.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he discussed the case primarily with Sloman and Menchel, and both\ntold OPR that while they did not share Acosta’s federalism concerns, they recalled that Acosta had\nthe terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7. Therefore, any allegations against the prosecutors could not have\nplayed a significant role in Acosta’s decisions as reflected in the term sheet.\n\n22o Sloman told OPR that Villafafia “always believed in the case.”\nl48\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l348", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021349.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON BS 3536o38, Pagel7/7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l75 of 348\n\nbeen concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on. . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.””” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . I was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\n\n228 Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\n\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\n\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\n\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\n\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\n\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l349", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021352.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TAS 3536o38, Pagel8o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l78 of 348\nfriendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.”\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “‘as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l352", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021354.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l8o | 3536o38, Pagel82 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8o of 348\n\nMenchel told OPR that when he and Sanchez were in the USAO, they had a social\nrelationship, which included, in 2oo3, ‘‘a handful of dates over a period of two to three weeks. We\ndecided that . . . this was probably best not to pursue, and we mutually agreed to not do that.”?”°\nApart from that, he stated they were “close” and “hung out,” and he asserted that this was knoun\nin the office at the time. Menchel said that his relationship with Sanchez “changed dramatically”\nwhen she left the office for private practice, and that by the time he became involved in the Epstein\ninvestigation, he had dated and married his wife, and his contact with Sanchez would “most likely”\nhave been at office events and when she atended his wedding.”*’ Menchel added, “[T]hat was\nthree and a half years [prior] for a very brief period of time, and I don’t think I gave it a moment’s\nthought.”\n\nWhen asked by OPR about the basis for the decision to make an offer of a two-year term\nof incarceration, Menchel said that he did not recall discussions about the two-year offer and did\nnot recall hou the office arrived at that figure. In response to OPR’s question, Menchel stated that\nhis relationship with Sanchez did “[n]ot at all” affect his handling of the Epstein case. Moreover,\nMenchel asserted that the contemporaneous documentary record supports a conclusion that it was\nAcosta, not Menchel, who made the decision to resolve the case with the two-year term.\n\nOPR carefully considered the documentary record on this point, as well as the statements\nto OPR from Menchel, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta, and concludes that there is no evidence\nsupporting the suggestion that the plea was instigated by Menchel as a favor to defense counsel.\nThe USAO’s first plea overture to defense counsel, which took place sometime before June 26,\n2oo7, occurred when Menchel spoke with Sanchez about the possibility of resolving the federal\ncase with a state plea that required jail time and sexual offender registration. According to the\nemail, “[i]t was a non-starter” for the defense. In the lengthy email exchange with Villafafia in\nearly July 2oo7, Menchel told her that his discussion with Sanchez about a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>\nwas made with Acosta’s “full knouledge.” Acosta corroborated this statement, telling OPR that\nalthough he did not remember a specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, he was certain Menchel would not have discussed this potential <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> with defense\ncounsel “without having discussed it with me.” Moreover, the defense did not immediately\n226 Acosta, Sloman, and Lourie each told OPR that in 2oo7, he was not aware that Menchel had previously dated\nSanchez. OPR questioned the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer regarding whether Menchel had an\nobligation to inform his supervisors of his dating relationship. The Professional Responsibility Officer said that it\nwould depend on “hou long the relationship was and hou compromised the individual felt he might appear to be,”\nbut he would have expected Menchel to raise the issue with Acosta. The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR\nthat if he had been approached for advice at the time, he would have asked for more facts, but “[g]iven the sensitivity\nof the [Epstein] mater, [my advice] would probably have been to tell him to step back and let somebody else take it\nover.” Menchel told OPR that if his relationship with Sanchez had turned into something more than a handful of\ndates, he would have advised his supervisors. Although OPR does not conclude Menchel’s prior relationship with\nSanchez influenced the Epstein investigation, OPR assesses that it would have been prudent for Menchel to have\ninformed his supervisors so they could make an independent assessment as to whether his continued involvement in\nthe Epstein investigation might create the appearance of a loss of impartiality.\neet Menchel’s Outlook records also indicate he scheduled lunch with Sanchez on at least one occasion, in early\n2oo6, after she left the USAO.\n\n228 In addition, Villafafia recalled Menchel stating at the July 26, 2oo7 meeting that “Alex has decided to offer\na two year state deal.”\nl54\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l354", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021356.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel84 of 258\nSA-l82\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l82 of 348\nincluding one called by the USAO to offer the NPA term sheet <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>—and a sixth meeting\ntogether with the State Atorney and the lead state prosecutor to discuss the state plea.

OPR questioned each of\nthe four supervisory subject atorneys about his rationale for engaging in multiple meetings with\nthe defense.\n\nLourie could not recall his reasoning for meeting with Epstein’s defense counsel, but he\ntold OPR that his general practice was to meet with defense counsel when asked to do so. Lourie\nrecognized that some prosecutors—like Villafafia—viewed meeting with the defense as a sign of\n“weakness,” but in Lourie’s view, “information is pouer,” and as long as the USAO did not share\ninformation with the defense but rather listened to their arguments, meetings were “all pouer to\nus.” Lourie explained that by meeting with the defense, “[Y]ou’re geting the information that\nthey think is important; that they’re going to focus on. The witnesses that they think are liars... .\nAnd so you can form all of that into your strategy.” Lourie also told OPR that giving defense\ncounsel the opportunity to argue the defense position is an important “part of the process” that\nhelped ensure procedural fairness, allouing them to “believe that they are geting heard.” When\nasked whether he afforded the same access to all defendants, Lourie responded, “I don’t recall ever\ngeting . . . so many requests for meetings .. . and so many appeals and so many audiences that\n[Epstein’s atorneys] got. But this was I think the first time that that’s really happened.”\n\nMenchel, too, told OPR that his general view was that “ethically it’s appropriate” to give a\ndefense atorney “an audience,” and there was no real “dounside” to doing so. Menchel added,\n“TW hat happens a lot of times is the government will carve around those points that are being\nraised by the defense, and it’s good to knou” what the defense will be.\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Acosta rejected the notion that his meeting with defense counsel\nwas unusual or outside the norm. He told OPR that his initial meeting with the defense team,\nbefore the NPA was signed, was “not the first and only time that I granted a meeting. . . to defense\natorneys” who requested one. Acosta did not believe it was “atypical” for a U.S. Atorney to meet\nwith opposing counsel, particularly as a case was coming to <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. Sloman corroborated\nAcosta on this point, telling OPR that Acosta typically met with defense atorneys, and that the\nUSAO handled requests for meetings from Epstein’s counsel “in the normal course.” Furthermore,\nAcosta said that notwithstanding that meeting and all the other “process” granted to the defense\nby the USAO and the Department, “we successfully held firm in our positions” on the key elements\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>—that is, the requirements that Epstein be incarcerated, register as a sexual\noffender, and provide monetary damages to the victims.\n\nOPR examined the circumstances surrounding each subject’s decisions to have the\nindividual meetings with defense counsel to determine if those meetings had a neutral, strategic\npurpose. The first meeting, on February l, 2oo7, folloued a phone call between Lourie and one\nof Epstein’s atorneys, in which the atorney asked for a chance to “make a pitch” about the\nvictims’ lack of credibility and suggested that Epstein might agree to an interview follouing that\npitch. Villafafia objected to meeting with the defense, but she recalled that Lourie told her she was\nnot being a “strategic thinker,” and that he believed the meeting could lead to a debriefing of\nEpstein. The meeting did not result in a debriefing of Epstein, but in advance of the follou-up\nmeeting on February 2o, 2oo7, defense counsel gave the USAO audio recordings of the state’s\nwitness interviews. Contemporaneous documents indicate that Lourie was unpersuaded by the\ndefense arguments. After Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum, Lourie suggested\n\nl57\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l357", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021365.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONO 3536o38, Pagel93 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9l of 348\n\nWith regard to her comment about “avoid[ing] the press,” Villafafia told OPR that her goal\nwas to protect the anonymity of the victims. She said that the case was far more likely to be\ncovered by the Palm Beach press, which had already writen articles about Epstein, than in Miami,\nand “if [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into the\ncourthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper.”\n\nIn evaluating the emails, OPR reviewed all the email exchanges between Villafafia, as well\nas Sloman and Acosta, and Lefkouitz and other defense counsel, including the portions redacted\nfrom the publicly released emails (except for a few to or from Acosta, copies of which OPR did\nnot locate in the USAO records). OPR also considered the emails in the broader context of\nVillafafia’s overall conduct during the federal investigation of Epstein. The documentary record,\nas well as witness and subject interviews, establishes that Villafafia consistently advocated in favor\nof prosecuting Epstein and worked for months touard that goal. She repeatedly pressed her\nsupervisors for permission to indict Epstein and made numerous efforts to expand the scope of the\ncase. She opposed meetings with the defense team, and nearly withdrew from the case because\nher supervisors agreed to those meetings. Villafafia objected to the decision to resolve the case\nthrough a guilty plea in state court, and she engaged in a lengthy and heated email exchange with\nMenchel about that subject. When she was assigned the task of creating an agreement to effect\nthat <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, Villafafia fought hard during the ensuing negotiations to hold the USAO’s position\ndespite defense counsel’s aggressive tactics.\n\nOPR also considered statements of her supervisors regarding her interactions with defense\ncounsel. Sloman, in particular, told OPR that reports that Villafafia “was soft on Epstein. . .\ncouldn’t have been further from the truth.” Sloman added that Villafafia “did her best to implement\nthe decisions that were made and to hold Epstein accountable.” Lourie similarly told OPR that\nwhen he read the district court’s February 2ol9 opinion in the CVRA litigation and the emails\nfrom Villafafia cited in that opinion, he was “surprised to see hou nice she was to them. And she\nwinds up taking it on the chin for being so nice to them. When I knou the whole time she was the\none who wanted to go after him the most.” The AUSA who assisted Villafafia on the investigation\ntold OPR “everything that [Villafafia] did . . . was, as far as I could tell, [ ] completely pro\nprosecution.”\n\nBecause the emails in question were publicly disclosed without context and without other\ninformation shouing Villafafia’s consistent efforts to prosecute Epstein and to assist victims, a\npublic narrative developed that Villafafia colluded with defense counsel to benefit Epstein at the\nexpense of the victims. After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that\nnarrative to be inaccurate. The USAO’s and Villafafia’s interactions with the victims can be\ncriticized, as OPR does in several respects in this Report, but the evidence is clear that any missteps\nVillafafia may have made in her interactions with victims or their atorneys were not made for the\npurpose of silencing victims. Rather, the evidence shous that Villafafia, in particular, cared deeply\nabout Epstein’s victims. Before the NPA was signed, she raised to her supervisors the issue of\nconsulting with victims, and after the NPA was signed, she drafted leters to notify victims\nidentified in the federal investigation of the pending state plea proceeding and inviting them to\nappear. The draft leters led defense counsel to argue to Department management that Villafafia\nand Sloman commited professional misconduct by “threaten[ing] to send a highly improper and\nunusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” of the listed victims. Given the full context of Villafafia’s\nconduct throughout her tenure on the case, OPR concludes that her explanations for her emails are\n\nl65\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l365", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021370.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lG 3536o38, Pagel98 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l96 of 348\nsuccessful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA, Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based <span class=\"highlight\">Resolution</span>\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l37o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021375.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3ol 3536o38, Page2o3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ol of 348\nEpstein’s state guilty plea.°?

Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerns about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.*°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2o Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\n424 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n258 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstein and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l375", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021377.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3o3 3536o38, Page2o5 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o3 of 348\nthe federal investigation in exchange for a plea in state court to a charge that carried a two-year\nsentence. The FBI co-case agent told OPR that, in a meeting to discuss the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, at which\nthe FBI was present, the co-case agent specifically suggested that the USAO wait to pursue a\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> until after the litigation was resolved, but this suggestion was “‘pushed under the rug”\nwithout comment. Although the co-case agent could not recall who was present, the case agent\nrecalled that Menchel led the meeting, which occurred while the litigation was still pending.\n\nEven after the NPA two-year state plea <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> was presented to the defense, Villafafia\ncontinued to press ahead to have the court resolve the issue concerning the defense production of\nthe computer equipment. On August lo, 2oo7, she asked Lourie for authorization to oppose\nEpstein’s efforts to stay the litigation until after an anticipated meeting between the USAO and the\ndefense, informing Lourie that a victim interviewed that week claimed she started seeing Epstein\nat age l4 and had been photographed in the nude. A few days later, Villafafia told defense counsel\nthat she had “conferred with the appropriate people, and we are not willing to agree to a stay.”\nDefense counsel then contacted Lourie, who agreed to postpone the hearing until after the\nupcoming meeting with Acosta. After the meeting, and when the court sought to reschedule the\nhearing, Villafafia emailed Sloman to ask if she should “put it off’; he replied, “Yes,” and the\nhearing was re-set for September l8, 2oo7. As negotiations touards the NPA progressed,\nhouever, the hearing was postponed indefinitely. Ultimately the NPA itself put the issue to rest\nby specifying that all legal process would be held in abeyance unless and until Epstein breached\nthe agreement.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she had learned through law enforcement channels that the defense\nteam had reviewed the contents of Epstein’s computers. She told OPR that, in her view, “the fact\nthat the defense was trying desperately to put off the hearing . . . was further evidence of the\nimportance of the evidence.”\n\nOPR questioned Acosta about the decisions to initiate, and continue with, the NPA\nnegotiations while the litigation concerning the computers was still pending, and to agree to\npostpone the litigation rather than exhausting all efforts to obtain and review the computer\nevidence. Acosta told OPR that he had no recollection of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the missing\ncomputers, but he believed that “there was a desire to move quickly as opposed to slouly”\nregarding the plea.\n\nMenchel, Sloman, and Lourie also all told OPR that they did not remember Villafafia’s\nefforts to obtain the computers or recalled the issue only “vaguely.” Menchel expressed surprise\nto OPR that a prosecutor could obtain ‘“‘an entire computer” through the method utilized by\nVillafafia, telling OPR, “I had not heard of that.” Houever, the contemporaneous records shou\nthat Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie had each been aware in 2oo7 of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s missing computer equipment.\n\nVillafafia kept Menchel, in particular, well informed of her efforts to obtain the computer\nequipment. She sent to Menchel, or copied him on, several emails about her plan to obtain the\ncomputer equipment; specifically, her emails on May l8, 2oo7, July 3, 2oo7, and July l6, 2oo7,\nall discussed her proposed steps. Villafafia told OPR that Lourie was involved in early discussions\nabout her proposal to obtain the evidence. Lourie also received Villafafia’s July l6, 2oo7 email\ndiscussing the computer equipment and the plan to obtain it, and on one occasion he spoke directly\n\nl77\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l377", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021379.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3o5 3536o38, Page2o7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o5 of 348\n\nTo be clear, OPR is not suggesting that prosecutors must obtain all available evidence\nbefore reaching plea agreements or that prosecutors cannot reasonably determine that reaching a\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> is more beneficial than continuing to litigate evidentiary issues. Every case is different\nand must be judged on its oun facts. In this case, houever, given the unorthodox nature of the\nstate-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, the fact that Acosta’s decision to pursue it set the case on a wholly different\ntrack than what had been originally contemplated by his experienced staff, the nature and scope of\nEpstein’s criminal conduct, the circumstances surrounding the removal of the computers from\nEpstein’s residence, and the potential for obtaining evidence revealing serious additional criminal\nconduct, Acosta had a responsibility to ensure that he was fully informed about the consequences\nof pursing the course of action that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flouing\nfrom the express terms of the NPA. In deciding to resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta lost sight\nof the bigger picture that the investigation was not completed and viable leads remained to be\npursued. The decision to forgo the government’s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and to\npursue significant investigative steps should have been made only after careful consideration of\nall the costs and benefits of the proposed action. OPR did not find evidence that Acosta fully\nconsidered the costs of ending the investigation prematurely.”°>\n\nC. OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of\n\nIncarceration, That It Was Tied to Traditional Sentencing Goals, or That It\nSatisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution\n\nThe heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency\nafforded him concerning his sentence. After offering a deal that required a “non-negotiable”\n24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an l8-month term of incarceration,\nknouing that gain time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served only l3 months.\nEpstein ultimately did not serve even that minimal sentence incarcerated on a full-time basis\nbecause the state alloued Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his\nsentence. As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything else that happened to [Epstein] is exactly what\nshould have happened to him... . He had to pay a lot of money. He had to register as a sex\noffender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”\n\nDue to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant\nevents, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of hou the original two-year sentence\nrequirement was developed or by whom. Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject\ninterviews: (l) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled\nguilty to an unspecified charge originally contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years\nrepresented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding\nthe need for a trial. As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of\nthe two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.” He elaborated,\na8 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney objected to OPR’s conclusion that Acosta knew or\nshould have knoun about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater consideration\nto pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed. Acosta’s atorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in\nthat level of “granularity”; that his ““‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that\nit was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him. For the reasons stated above, OPR\nnonetheless concludes that having developed a unique <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> to a federal investigation, Acosta had a greater\nobligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l379", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021380.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 3o6 3536o38, Page2o8 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o6 of 348\n“[’m reconstructing memories of... l2 years ago. I can speculate that at some point, the mater\ncame up, and I or someone else said... what would the original charges have likely brought? And\nsomeone said this amount.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall who initially proposed this\nmethod, but he believed that it likely did not result from a single specific discussion but rather\nfrom conversations over a course of time. Acosta could not recall specifically with whom he had\nthese discussions, other than that it would have been Lourie, Menchel, or Sloman. Villafafia was\nnot asked for her views on a two-year sentence, and she had no input into the decision before it\nwas made. Villafafia told OPR that she examined the state statutes and could not validate that a\nstate charge would have resulted in a 24-month sentence. OPR also examined applicable state\nstatutes and the Florida sentencing guidelines, but could not confirm that Epstein was, in fact,\nfacing a potential two-year sentence under charges contemplated by the PBPD.\n\nOn the other hand, during his OPR interview, Lourie “guess[ed]” that “somehou the\ndefense conveyed .. . we’re going to trial if it’s more than two years.” Menchel similarly told\nOPR that he did not knou hou the two year sentence was derived, but “obviously it was a number\nthat the office felt was palatable enough that [Epstein] would take” it. Sloman told OPR that he\nhad no idea hou the two-year sentence proposal was reached.\n\nThe contemporaneous documentary record, houever, provides no indication that Epstein’s\nteam proposed a two-year sentence of incarceration or initially suggested, before the USAO made\nits offer, that Epstein would accept a two-year term of incarceration. As late as July 25, 2oo7—\nonly days before the USAO provided the term sheet to defense counsel—Epstein’s counsel\nsubmited a leter to the USAO arguing that the federal government should not prosecute Epstein\nat all. Furthermore, after the initial “term sheet” was presented and negotiations for the NPA\nprogressed, Epstein’s team continued to strongly press for less or no time in jail.\n\nThe USAO had other charging and sentencing options available to it. The most obvious\nalternative to the two-year sentence proposal was to offer Epstein a plea to a federal offense that\ncarried a harsher sentence. If federally charged, Epstein was facing a substantial sentence under\nthe federal sentencing guidelines, l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment. Houever, it is unlikely that\nhe would have agreed to a plea that required a guidelines sentence, even one at the louer end of\nthe guidelines. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues had been concerned that Epstein\nwould opt to go to trial if charged and presented with the option of pleading to a guidelines\nsentence, and as previously discussed, there were both evidentiary and legal risks atendant upon\na trial in this case. If federally charged, Epstein’s sentencing exposure could have been managed.\nby offering him a plea under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c) for a stipulated sentence,\nwhich requires judicial approval. Acosta rejected this idea, houever, apparently because of a\nperception that the federal district courts in the Southern District of Florida did not view Rule ll(c)\npleas favorably and might refuse to accept such a plea and thus limit the USAO’s options.\n\nAnother alternative was to offer Epstein a plea to conspiracy, a federal charge that carried\na maximum five-year sentence. Shortly after Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum\nto her supervisors, Lourie recommended to Acosta charging Epstein by criminal complaint and\noffering a plea to conspiracy “to make a plea atractive.” Similarly, before learning that Menchel\nhad already discussed a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> with Epstein’s counsel, Villafafia had considered\noffering Epstein a plea to one count of conspiracy and a substantive charge, to be served\nconcurrently with any sentence he might receive separately as a result of the state’s outstanding\n\nl8o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l38o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021381.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 3o7 3536o38, Page2o9 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o7 of 348\nindictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>\nthat ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would\nbe sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\ntraditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis. In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l38l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021383.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3o9 3536o38, Page2ll of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o9 of 348\nthe defendant faced decades in prison for sexual crimes against minors with such an insignificant\nterm of incarceration, and made numerous other concessions to the defense. As OPR has set forth\nin substantial detail in this Report, OPR did not find evidence to support allegations that the\nprosecutors sought to benefit Epstein at the expense of the victims. Instead, the result can more\nappropriately be tied to Acosta’s misplaced concerns about interfering with a traditionally state\ncrime and intruding on state authority. Acosta was also unwilling to abandon the path that he had\nset, even when Villafafia and Lourie advocated to end the negotiations and even though Acosta\nhimself had learned that the state authorities may not have been a reliable partner.\n\nMany of the problems that developed might have been avoided had Acosta engaged in\ngreater consultation with his staff before making key decisions. The contemporaneous records\nrevealed problems with communication and coordination among the five key participants. Acosta\nwas involved to a greater extent and made more decisions than he did in a typical case. Lourie\ntold OPR that it was “unusual to have a U.S. Atorney get involved with this level of detail.”\nMenchel told OPR, “I knou we would have spoken about this case a lot, okay? And I’m sure with\nJeff as well, and there were conversations -- a meeting that I had with Marie and Andy as well.”\nLourie similarly told OPR:\n\nWell, .. . he would have been talking to Jeff and Mat, talking to me\nto the extent that he did, he would have been looking at the Pros\nMemo and... the guidance from CEOS, he would have been\nreading the defense atorney’s leters, maybe talking to the State\nAtorney, I don’t knou, just... all these different sources of\ninformation he was -- I’m comfortable that he knew the case, you\nknou, that he was, he was reading everything. Apparently, he, you\nknou, read the Pros Memo, he read all the stuff....\n\nAt the same time, Acosta was significantly removed, both in physical distance and in levels\nin the supervisory chain, from the individuals with the most knouledge of the facts of the case—\nVillafafia and, to a lesser extent, Lourie. Lourie normally would have signed off on the prosecution\nmemorandum on his oun, but as he told OPR, he recognized that the case was going to go through\nthe front office “[b]ecause there was front office involvement from the get go.” Yet, although\nAcosta became involved at certain points in order to make decisions, he did not view himself as\noverseeing the investigation or the details of implementing his decisions. OPR observed that as a\nconsequence, management of the case suffered from both an absence of ounership of the\ninvestigation and failures in communication that affected critical decisions.\n\nOn occasion, Villafafia included Acosta directly in emails, but often, information upon\nwhich Acosta relied for his decisions and information about the decisions Acosta had made\ntraveled through multiple layers between Acosta and Villafafia. Villafafia did draft a detailed,\nanalytical prosecution memorandum, but it is not clear that Acosta read it and instead may have\nrelied on conversations primarily with Menchel and later with Sloman after Menchel’s departure.\nDespite these discussions, though, it is not clear that Acosta was aware of certain information, such\nas Oosterban’s strong opinion from the outset in favor of the prosecution or of Villafafia’s\nconcerns and objections to a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> or the final NPA. Acosta interpreted the state\nindictment on only one charge as a sign that the case was weak evidentially, but it is not clear that\nwhen making his decision to resolve the mater though a state-based plea, he knew the extent to\n\nl83\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l383", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021384.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lo. 3536o38, Page2l2 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2lo of 348\nwhich Villafafia and Lourie believed that the state had intentionally failed to aggressively pursue\na broader state indictment.\n\nOne example illustrates this communication gap. In a September 2o, 2oo7 email to Lourie\nasking him to read the latest version of the proposed “hybrid” federal plea agreement (calling for\nEpstein to plead to both state and federal charges), Acosta noted, “I don’t typically sign plea\nagreements. We should only go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement. I\ndidn’t even sign the public corruption or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not be the first.”\n(Emphasis added.) In his email to Villafafia, Lourie atached Acosta’s email and instructed\nVillafafia to “change the signature block to your name and send as final to Jay [Lefkouitz].”\n(Emphasis added.) Villafafia raised no objection to signing the agreement. Acosta told OPR that\nhe wanted to give the “trial team” a chance to “speak up and let him knou” if they did not feel\ncomfortable with the agreement. Villafafia, houever, told OPR that she did not understand that\nshe was being given an opportunity to object to the agreement; rather, she believed Acosta wanted.\nher to sign it because he was taking an “‘arm’s length” approach and signaling this “was not his\ndeal.” The fact that the top decision maker believed he was giving the line AUSA an opportunity\nto reflect and stop the process if she believed the deal was inappropriate, but the line AUSA\nbelieved she was being ordered to sign the agreement because her boss wanted to distance himself\nfrom the decision, reflects a serious communication gap.\n\nAs another example, at one point, Villafafia, frustrated and concerned about the decisions\nbeing made concerning a possible <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, requested a meeting with Acosta; in a sternly worded\nrebuke, Menchel rejected the request. Although Menchel told OPR that he was not prohibiting\nVillafafia from speaking to Acosta, Villafafia interpreted Menchel’s email to mean that she could\nnot seek a meeting with Acosta. As a consequence, Acosta made his decision about a state\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> and the term of incarceration without any direct input from Villafafia. Acosta told OPR\nthat he was unaware that Villafafia had sought a meeting with him and he would have met with\nher if she had asked him directly. OPR did not find any writen evidence of a meeting involving\nboth Acosta—the final decision maker—and Villafafia—the person most knouledgeable about the\nfacts and the law—before Acosta made his decision to resolve the case through state charges or to\noffer the two-year term, and Villafafia said she did not have any input into the decision. Although\na U.S. Atorney is certainly not required to have such direct input, and it may be that Menchel\npresented what he believed to be Villafafia’s views, OPR found no evidence that Acosta was aware\nof Villafafia’s strong views about, and objections to, the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>.”°°\n\nTwo logistical problems hindered effective communication. First, the senior managers\ninvolved in the case—Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel—had offices located in Miami, while the\noffices of the individuals most familiar with facts of the case—Villafafia and, to a lesser extent,\nLourie—were located in West Palm Beach. Consequently, Villafafia’s discussions with her senior\n#9o In her 2ol7 Declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that, given the challenges of obtaining\nvictims’ cooperation with a federal prosecution, “I believed and still believe that a negotiated <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the mater\nwas in the best interests of the [USAO] and the victims as a whole. The [USAO] had also reached that same\nconclusion.” Several subjects pointed to this statement as indicating that Villafafia in fact supported the NPA. In her\nOPR interview, houever, Villafafia drew a distinction between resolving the investigation through negotiations that\nled to what in her view was a reasonable outcome, which she would have supported, and “this negotiated <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>” —\nthat is, the NPA—which she did not support.\n\nl84\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l384", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021385.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TT 3536o38, Page2l3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ll of 348\nmanagers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.°’\n\nSecond, key personnel were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the .. . bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third\n2oH In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l385", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021386.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lD 3536o38, Page2l4 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l2 of 348\nparties.*°> The rush to reach a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> should not have led the USAO to agree to such a\nsignificant provision without a full consideration of the potential consequences and justification\nfor the provision. It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused.\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n#o8 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s\n\nunderstood that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you\n\nknou the husband’s willing to go and take the weight .... This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l386", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021387.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3l3 3536o38, Page2l5 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l3 of 348\nfrom Villafafia and others, but given the highly unusual procedure being considered, his decision\nshould have been made only after a full consideration of all of the possible ramifications and\nconsequences of pushing the mater into the state court system, with which neither Villafafia nor\nthe other subjects had experience, along with consideration of the legal and evidentiary issues and\npossible means of overcoming those issues. OPR did not find evidence indicating that such a\nmeeting or discussion with the full team was held before the decision was made to pursue the\nstate-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term of incarceration, or\nbefore the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed. As Acosta later recognized and told OPR,\n“And a question that I think is a valid one in my mind is, did the focus on, let’s just get this done\nand get a jail term, mean that we didn’t take a step back and say, let’s evaluate hou this train is\nmoving?”\n\nMany features of the NPA were given inadequate consideration, including core provisions\nlike the term of incarceration and sexual offender registration, with the result that Epstein was able\nto manipulate the process to his benefit. Members of his senior staff held differing opinions about\nsome of the issues that Acosta felt were important and that factored into his decision-making.\nThere does not seem to be a point, houever, at which those differing opinions were considered\nwhen forming a strategy; rather, Acosta seems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him\nfolloued and atempted to implement but without a considered strategy beyond ataining the three\ncore elements. As the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had authority to proceed in this manner, but many of\nthe problems that developed with the NPA might have been avoided with a more thoughtful\napproach. As Acosta belatedly recognized, “[I]f I was advising a fellou U.S. Atorney today, I\nwould say, think it through.””°?\n\nNo one of the individual problems discussed above necessarily demonstrates poor\njudgment by itself. Houever, in combination, the evidence shous that the state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>\nwas ill conceived from the start and that the NPA resulted from a flawed decision-making process.\nFrom the time the USAO opened its investigation, Acosta recognized the federal interest in\nprosecuting Epstein, yet after that investigation had run for more than a year, he set the\ninvestigation on a path not originally contemplated. Having done so, he had responsibility for\nensuring that he received and considered all of the necessary information before puting an end to\na federal investigation into serious criminal conduct. Acosta’s failure to adequately consider the\nfull ramifications of the NPA contributed to a process and ultimately a result that left not only the\nline AUSA and the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also caused victims and the public to question\nthe motives of the prosecutors and whether any reasonable measure of justice was achieved.\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he chose a course of\naction that was in marked contrast to the action that the Department would reasonably expect an\natorney exercising good judgment to take.\n\n259 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney acknouledged that “[t]he mater would have\nbenefited from more consistent staffing and atention.”\nl87\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l387", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021390.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l6 of 348\ne * rm: *\nTimeline of Key Events for Crime Victims’ Rights Act Analysis\nAug lo~- FBI Dec 7 — Sloman tells July 7 —Jane Doe files an Additional Key Dates O\nbegins interviewing Vv illafafia to “hold the emergency petition against oO\nvictims leter” re notification to the United States asserting Dec l7, 2olo — DOJ oO\ncna state court violations of the CVRA Office of Legal Ro\nAug 24 — Villafafia e-mail amici aman UM guccnes eli inion i\n8 28 : “es y : \" a secures pit-bone July 9 — USAO begins geoardi one x\n: ‘aes b a ee aoe Dec l9 — Acosta sends pound ac sending leters to victims No\n“i ‘fica a ar he a ill leter to Epstein’s counsel Sakine= Fay concerning <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of Oct 2oll — DOJ revises om\nunease ean al Ei advising USAO will defer spaseg sat ee federal investigation AG Guidelines\nof the girls Matis Ceara interviews victims Oo\nnotification of state plea fe)\nto state officials May 29, 2ol5 —-CVRA OQ\n\\] Aug 28 — FBI begins a\" amended to include two 5\nge ed ee Jan lo FBI new rights D\nds VNS letw ; =|\nracial bait Feb 2l, 2ol9 — Dist.

The Case Agents and Villafaia Solicit Some Victims’ Opinions about\nResolving the Federal Investigation\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when she and the case agents met with victims, “we would ask\nthem hou they wanted the case to be resolved.”7*!\n\nAnd most of them wanted the case to be resolved via a plea. Some\nof them wanted him not to be prosecuted at all. Most of them did\nnot want to have to come to court and testify. They were very\nworried about their privacy rights. Some of them wanted him to go\nto jail. But... [s]ome of them talked about bad experiences with\nthe State Atorney’s Office. And so, I felt like sending them back to\nthe State Atorney’s Office was not something that they would have\nsupported.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she also recalled that some victims “expressed . . . concern about\ntheir safety,” and were worried that Epstein would find out about their participation in the\ninvestigation. In her 2ol7 declaration submited in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that the\ntwo CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my\nrole was to evaluate the entire situation, consider the input received from all of the victims, and\nallou the Office to exercise its prosecutorial discretion accordingly.”*” She also noted that some\nvictims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would\nhave on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”\n\nIn the FBI case agent’s 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During\ninterviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be\nprosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s]\n\nvictims .... A majority of the victims expressed concern about the\n\npossible disclosure of their identities to the public. A number of the\n\nvictims raised concerns about having to testify and/or their parents\n\nfinding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein. Additionally,\n28l Villafafia created for OPR a chart listing victims identified in the state and federal investigations, with\nnotations indicating several with whom Villafafia recalled discussing their opinions about resolving the case. The\nchart, houever, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafafia told OPR that the information contained in the\nchart was based on her memory of her interactions with each victim. OPR was unable to determine the details or\nextent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2oo7, because Villafafia did not have contemporaneous\nnotes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information\nabout the victims’ desired outcomes. The victims who provided information to OPR did not recall discussing potential\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal investigation with anyone from the government.\n282 In the declaration, Villafafia stated, “Jane Doe 2 specifically told me that she did not want Epstein\nprosecuted.”\n\n2ol\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4ol", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021402.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 358 3536o38, Page23o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 228 of 348\nfor some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall,\nmany of the victims were troubled about the existence of the\ninvestigation. They displayed feelings of embarrassment and\nhumiliation and were reluctant to talk to investigators. Some\nvictims who were identified through the investigation refused even\nto speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and\ngeting to the truth were always at the forefront of our handling of\nthe investigation.\nThe case agent told OPR that although she encountered victims who were “strong” and\n“believable,” she did not encounter any who vigorously advocated for the prosecution of Epstein.\nRather, “they were embarrassed,” “didn’t want their parents to knou,” and “wanted to forget.”?*\nAs of September 24, 2oo7, the date the NPA was signed, Villafafia informed Epstein\natorney Lefkouitz that she had compiled a preliminary list of victims including “34 confirmed\nminors” and 6 other potential minor victims who had not yet been interviewed by the FBI.7**\nAlthough the government had contacted many victims before the NPA was signed, Villafafia\nacknouledged during the CVRA litigation that “individual victims were not consulted regarding\nthe agreement.”\nB. Before the NPA Is Signed, Villafaia Expresses Concern That Victims Have\nNot Been Consulted\nBefore the NPA was signed, Villafafia articulated to her supervisors concerns about the\ngovernment’s failure to consult with victims.\nl. July 2oo7: Villafaia’s Email Exchanges with Menchel\nIn July 2oo7, Villafafia learned that Menchel had discussed with defense counsel Sanchez\na possible state <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> to the federal investigation of Epstein. Villafafia was upset by this\ninformation, and sent a strongly worded email to Menchel voicing her concerns. (A full account\nof their email exchange is set forth at Chapter Two, Part One, Section IV.A.2.) In that email, she\ntold him that it was “inappropriate [for you] to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE, the victims, and me. These plea negotiations violate... all of the\n285 The case agent also noted that the victim who became CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 had expressed in her\nApril 2oo7 video-recorded FBI interview her opinion that “nothing should happen to Epstein.”\n284 The “victims’ list” for purposes of the NPA was intended to include the names of all individuals whom the\ngovernment was prepared to name in a charging document “‘as victims of an offense enumerated in l8 U.S.C. § 2255.”\nAlthough the charges Villafafia proposed on May l, 2oo7, were based on crimes against l3 victims, thereafter, as\nexplained in Chapter Two of this Report, she continued to revise the proposed charges, adding and removing victims\nas the federal investigation developed further evidence. At the time the NPA was signed, the proposed charges were\nbased on crimes against l9 victims, but others had been identified for potential inclusion.\n2o2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021403.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 359 | 3536o38, Page23l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 229 of 348\n\nvarious iterations of the victims’ rights legislation.”**° Villafafia explained to OPR her reference\nto the victims:\n\n[M]y concern was that [Menchel] was violating the CVRA which\n\nrequires the atorneys for the government, which[] includes me[,] to\n\nconfer with the victims, and the [VRRA], which requires the agents\n\nto keep the victims apprised of what’s happening with the case. So\n\nin essence, I felt like he was exposing both myself and the agents to\n\nallegations of not abiding by our obligations by engaging in these\n\nplea negotiations without leting us knou about it.”\n\nIn his reply to Villafafia’s email, and after noting that he found her email “totally\ninappropriate,” Menchel denied that he had violated any Departmental policy, and he noted that\n“Tals Chief of the Criminal Division, I am the person designated by the U.S. Atorney to exercise\nappropriate discretion in deciding whether certain pleas are appropriate and consistent with”\nDepartmental policy. Perceiving Menchel’s rebuke as a criticism of her judgment, Villafafia\nresponded, “[R]aising concerns about the forgoten voices of victims in this case should not be\nclassified as a lapse in judgment” and that her “first and only concern in this case... is the victims.”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not view his conversation with Sanchez as a plea offer,\nasserted that he was not obligated to consult with victims during preliminary setlement\nnegotiations, and noted that he left the USAO before the NPA was fully negotiated or signed.\nMenchel told OPR that ‘you have discussions . . . with [the] defense all the time, and the notion\nthat even just having a general discussion is something that must be veted with victims . . . is not\neven... in the same universe as to hou I think about this.” Menchel also observed that on the\nvery day that Villafafia criticized him for engaging in setlement negotiations without consulting\nher, the FBI, or the victims, Villafafia had herself sent an email to Sanchez offering “to discuss the\npossibility of a federal <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of Mr. Epstein’s case that could run concurrently with any state\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>,” without having spoken to the victims about her proposal.?*’\n\n28 Villafafia told OPR that “some victims, I felt strongly, would have objected to [a state-only disposition].”\nVillafafia stated to OPR that at the time Menchel engaged in such negotiations, he would only have been aware of the\nvictim information contained in her prosecution memorandum, which included information about the “effects on the\nvictims” but did not likely contain information as to “hou they would like the case resolved.” Villafafia asserted that\nMenchel “never reached out to any of the victims to find out what their position would be.” Menchel told OPR that\nthe allegations in Villafafia’s email that he violated the Ashcroft Memo, USAM, and the CVRA were “way out of line\nin terms of what the law is and the policies are.”\n286 As discussed, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not apply before charges were\nfiled against a defendant.\n287 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel asserted that her email to Sanchez was intended\nonly to determine whether Epstein was interested in opening plea negotiations.\n\n2o3\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4o3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021405.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 33l 3536o38, Page233 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23l of 348\nChief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.””°! Sloman forwarded this\nemail to Acosta. Villafafia recalled that Sloman responded to her email by telephone, possibly\nafter he had spoken to Acosta, and stated, “[Y]Jou can’t do that nou.” Villafafia did not recall\nSloman explaining at the time the reason for that instruction.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve\nbeen advised that . . . pre-charge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Sloman did not\nrecall any discussions, before the NPA was signed, about contacting the victims or conferring with\nthem regarding the potential <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the case. Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that\nwe had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek\napproval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the notification issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.”” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”?”?\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.*™ Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “‘an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate\n29l Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “the was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\neee Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\n\n223 The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n294 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto... instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021406.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 339 3536o38, Page234 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 232 of 348\n\ndisagreement” regarding the CVRA’s requirements.””° Oosterban’s disagreement was based on\npolicy considerations, and he told OPR that “from a policy perspective,” CEOS would not “take a\nposition that you wouldn’t consult with [the victims].” Oosterban also told OPR that whether or\nnot the law required it, the victims should have been given an opportunity “to weigh in directly,”\nbut he did not fault the USAO’s motivations for failing to provide that opportunity:\n\nThe people I knou, Andy [Lourie], Jeff [Sloman], . . . were trying\n\nto do the right thing... . [T]hey weren’t acting unethically. I just\n\ndisagree with the outcome .. . but the point is they weren’t trying\n\n... to do anything improper . . . it was more of this question of . . .\n\nyou can let the victims weigh in on this, you can get their input on\n\nthis and maybe it doesn’t sway you. You still do what you’ re going\n\nto do but... it’s hard to say it was a complete, completely clean\n\nexercise of . . . prosecutorial discretion when [the USAO] didn’t\n\nreally knou what [the victims] would say.\n\nSloman told OPR, “I don’t think we had a concern about entering into the NPA at that point\nin terms of notifying victims. ... I was under the perception that once the NPA was entered into\nand [Epstein] was going to enter a guilty plea in state court that we were going to notify the\nvictims.”\n\nVII. SEPTEMBER 24, 2oo7 — JUNE 3o, 2oo8: AFTER THE NPA IS SIGNED, THE\n\nUSAO MAKES VARIOUS VICTIM NOTIFICATION DECISIONS\n\nThe contemporaneous emails make clear that once the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the\ncase agents planned to inform the victims about the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal investigation.\nHouever, the emails also shou that the USAO was unclear about hou much information could be\ngiven to the victims in light of the NPA’s nondisclosure provision and consulted with Epstein’s\ndefense counsel regarding victim notifications.”°° As a result, although the expectation in the\nUSAO was that the victims would be informed about the NPA, the monetary damages provision,\nand the state plea, the USAO became entangled in more negotiations with the defense atorneys,\nwho strongly objected to the government’s notification plan. In addition, Villafafia and the case\nagents grew concerned that notifying the victims about the NPA monetary damages provision\nwould damage the victims’ credibility if Epstein breached the NPA and the case went to trial.

The [PBPD] Chief was\nonly concerned that he not get surprised by all this.”*”? Acosta responded that he would set up a\ncall on September 26, 2oo7, to talk “about who we can tell and hou much.”3°°\n\nAlso on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed the new West Palm Beach manager to\ninform him that once the atorney representative was appointed for the victims, she planned to\n“meet with the girls myself to explain hou the system [for obtaining relief under l8 U.S.C. § 2255]\nwill work.” Villafafia also emailed Lefkouitz stating that she planned to discuss with him “what\nI can tell [the atorney representative] and the girls about the agreement,” and she assured\nLefkouitz that her office “is telling Chief Reiter not to disclose the outcome to anyone.” Villafafia\nalso provided Lefkouitz with a list of potential candidates for the atorney representative position\nand advocated for an atorney representative who would minimize press coverage of the mater.\n\nOn September 26, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Lefkouitz to request guidance on informing the\nvictims about the NPA: “Can you give me a call... Iam meeting with the agents and want to\ngive them their marching orders regarding what they can tell the girls.” Villafafia told OPR that\nbecause the government and the defense had not agreed on the atorney representative for the\nvictims, she reached out to the defense at the direction of either Acosta or Sloman in order to\ncoordinate hou to inform the victims about the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the case and the fact that there would\nbe an atorney to assist them in recovering monetary damages from Epstein.

According to Villafafia, Sloman then directed her to have the case\nagents make the victim notifications.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia directed the case agents to “meet with the victims to provide them\nwith information regarding the terms of the [NPA] and the conclusion of the federal investigation.”\nThe case agent told OPR, “[T]here was a discussion that Marie and I had as\nto... hou we would tell them, and what we would tell them, and what that was I don’t recall, but\nit was the terms of the agreement.” Villafafia believed that if “victims were properly notified of\nthe terms [of the NPA] that applied to them, regarding their right to seek damages from [Epstein],\nand he paid those damages, that the rest of the [NPA] doesn’t need to be disclosed.” Villafafia\n“anticipated that [the case agents] would be able to inform the victims of the date of the state court\nchange of plea [hearing], but that date had not yet been set by state authorities at the time the first\nvictims were notified [by the FBI].” Villafafia told OPR that it was her belief that because the\nUSAO had agreed to a confidentiality clause, the government could not disclose the NPA to the\ngeneral public, but victims could be informed “because by its terms they needed to be told what\nthe agreement was about.” Villafafia told OPR that no one in her supervisory chain expressed a\nconcern that if victims learned of the NPA, they would try to prevent Epstein from entering a plea.\n\nWithin a week after the NPA was signed, news media began reporting that the parties had\nreached a deal to resolve the Epstein case. For example, on October l, 2oo7, the\nNew York Post reported that Epstein “has agreed to plead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes\nat his Florida mansion in a deal that will send him to prison for about l8 months,” and noted that\nEpstein would plead guilty in state court and that “the feds have agreed to drop their probe into\npossible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge.”°”!\n\nThe case agent recalled informing some victims that “there was an agreement reached” and\n“we would not be pursuing this federally.” In October 2oo7, for example, the case agents met with\nvictim Courtney Wild, “to advise her of the main terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement.”\nAccording to the case agent, during that meeting, the case agents told Wild “that an agreement had\nbeen reached, Mr. Epstein was going to plead guilty to two state charges, and there would not be\na federal prosecution.”°°” Houever, in a declaration filed in 2ol5 in the CVRA litigation, Wild\ndescribed the conversation differently:\n\n[T]he agents explained that Epstein was also being charged in State\n\ncourt and may plea [sic] to state charges related to some of his other\n\nvictims.

Villafafia recalled that during a brief telephone consultation, the Professional\nResponsibility Officer advised her and the case agent that “it’s not really that big a concern, but if\nyou’re concerned about it then you should stop making the notification.”°° In her 2ol7 CVRA\ndeclaration, the case agent stated that after conferring with the USAO, the case agents stopped\nnotifying victims about the NPA.\n\nB. October 2oo7: Defense Atorneys Object to Government Victim Notifications\n\nWhile the case agents and Villafafia considered the impact that notifying the victims about\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the case might have on a potential trial, defense counsel also raised concerns\nabout what the victims could be told about the NPA. As discussed in Chapter Two, after the NPA\nwas signed on September 24, 2oo7, the USAO proposed using a special master to select the\natorney representative for the victims, which led to further discussions about the § 2255 provision.\nOn October 5, 2oo7, when defense atorney Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a leter responding to the\nUSAO’s proposal to use a special master, he cautioned that “neither federal agents nor anyone\nfrom your Office should contact the identified individuals to inform them of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the\ncase” because such communications would “violate the confidentiality of the agreement” and\nwould prevent Epstein from having control over “what is communicated to the identified\nindividuals at this most critical stage.” Lefkouitz folloued this communication with an October\nlo, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, arguing that “[n]either federal agents nor anyone from your Office should\ncontact the identified individuals to inform them of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the case.”°°° Rather,\nLefkouitz wanted to “participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication to the identified\nindividuals.”\n\nOn October 23, 2oo7, Villafafia raised the issue of victim notification with Sloman, stating:\n\nWe also have to contact the victims to tell [them] about the outcome\nof the case and to advise them that an atorney will be contacting\nthem regarding possible claims against Mr. Epstein. If we don’t do\nthat, it may be a violation of the Florida Bar Rules for the selected\natorney to ‘cold call’ the girls.\n\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter Two, on October 23, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent Acosta\na leter stating that Epstein expected to enter a guilty plea in state court on November 2o, 2oo7,\n2o8 The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR that he did not recall the case agent contacting him about\nvictim notification, nor did he recall being involved in the Epstein mater before the CVRA litigation was instituted\nin July 2oo8 and he was assigned to handle the litigation. Villafafia told OPR that they consulted the Professional\nResponsibility Officer over the telephone, the call took no more than “five minutes,” and the Professional\nResponsibility Officer had no other exposure to the case and thus “wouldn’t have [any] context for it.”\n\n3o6 Lefkouitz also argued that direct contact with the victims could violate grand jury secrecy rules.\n2lo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021411.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 337 3536o38, Page239 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 237 of 348\nand thanking Acosta for agreeing on October l2, 2oo7, not to “contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this\nmater.”°°’ Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Acosta\nrevised to clarify the “inaccurate” representations made by Lefkouitz, in particular noting that\nAcosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact. The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\ncommunications that are typical in these maters. As an example,\nour Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them\nthat either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing]\nthem. Rest assured that we will continue to treat this mater as we\nwould any similarly situated case.°”°\nIn a November 5, 2oo7 leter, Sloman complained to Lefkouitz that private investigators\nworking for Epstein had been contacting victims and asking whether government agents had\ndiscussed financial setlement with them. Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some circumstances.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?””>””\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to Investigate,\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been identified in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o7 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\n3o8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n3o8 Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to\ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021412.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 338 3536o38, Page24o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 238 of 348\nNPA.3!° The FBI reports of the victim interviews do not mention the NPA or indicate that the\nvictims were asked for their input regarding the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the case. Villafafia acknouledged\nthat she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the\nagreement because “‘at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and\nthat we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”\n\nOn October l2, 2oo7, the FBI Victim Specialist sent a VNS form notice leter to a victim\nthe case agents had interviewed two days earlier. This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim Specialist sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\nidentified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD. The USAO Informs the Defense That It Intends to Notify Victims by Leter\nabout Epstein’s State Plea Hearing and the <span class=\"highlight\">Resolution</span> of the Federal\nInvestigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the Notification Plan\n\nIn anticipation of Epstein’s state court plea, Villafafia reported on November l6, 2oo7, to\nAcosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that she had learned, from FBI agents who met with\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek, that the State Atorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify\nvictims of the state plea hearing.\n\n[Belohlavek] would still like us to do the victim notifications. The\n\nState does not have a procedure (like we do federally) where the\n\nCourt has to provide a separate room for victims who want to atend\n\njudicial proceedings, so I do not knou hou many victims will\n\nactually want to be present.3!!\nBelohlavek told OPR that she did not recall the conversation referenced by the FBI nor any\ncoordination between her office and federal officials to contact or notify victims about Epstein’s\nstate plea hearing.\n\nOn November l9, 2oo7, Villafafia decided that to avoid any misconduct accusations from\nthe defense about the information given to victims, she “would put the victim notification in\nwriting.” She provided Sloman with a draft victim notification leter, in which among other things,\ncae Not all the individuals interviewed qualified for inclusion on the victim list. For example, one would not\ncooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third\nclaimed she had no contact with Epstein.\naul Villafafia told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or\ntwo victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”\n\n2l2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4l2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021413.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 339 3536o38, Page24l of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 239 of 348\nshe would inform victims of the terms of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal case, including Epstein’s\nagreement to plead guilty to state charges and serve l8 months in county jail, and the victims’\nability to seek monetary damages against Epstein. The leter also would invite victims to appear\nat the state court hearing and make a statement under oath or provide a writen statement to be\nfiled by the State Atorney’s Office. Sloman and Villafafia exchanged edits on the draft victim\nnotification leter, and Villafafia also informed Sloman that “[t]here are a few girls who didn’t\nreceive the original leters, so I will need to modify the introductory portion of the leter for\nthose.”\n\nSloman informed Lefkouitz of the government’s need to meet its “statutory obligation\n(Justice for All Act of 2oo4) to notify the victims of the anticipated upcoming events and their\nrights associated with the agreement” and his intent to “notify the victims by leter after COB\nThursday, November 29.” Lefkouitz objected to the proposal to notify the victims, asserting that\nit was “incendiary and inappropriate” and not warranted under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4. He\nargued that the defense “should have a right to review and make objections to that submission\nprior to it being sent to any alleged victims.” He also insisted that if any notification leters were\nsent to “victims, who still have not been identified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein\nhas entered his plea” and that the leter should come from the atorney representative rather than\nthe government. On November 28, 2oo7, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia provided Lefkouitz\nwith the draft victim notification leter, which would advise victims that the state court plea was\nto occur on December l4, 2oo7.7\n\nIn a November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz strongly objected to the proposed draft\nnotification leter, arguing that the government was not obligated to send any leter to victims until\nafter Epstein’s plea and sentencing. Lefkouitz also contended that the victims had no right to\nappear at Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing or to provide a writen statement for such a\nproceeding. In a November 3o, 2oo7 reply leter to Lefkouitz, Acosta did not address the\nsubstance of Lefkouitz’s arguments, but accused the defense team of “in essence presenting\ncollateral challenges” delaying effectuation of the NPA, and asserted that if Epstein was\ndissatisfied with the NPA, “we stand ready to unwind the Agreement” and proceed to trial. Shortly\nthereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by leter that he had directed prosecutors “not to\nissue victim notification leters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time\nto review these options with your client.” In the leter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that\nVillafafia had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary\ndamages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during\nthe investigation phase of this mater.”\n\nOn December 5, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz sent a leter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman\nand Assistant Atorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with\nail On November 28, 2oo7, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafafia that\nonly l5 of the then-knoun victims had received victim notification leters from either the FBI or the USAO. On\nDecember 6, 2oo7, the lead case agent reported to Villafafia that she was “still holding many of the original V/W\nleters addressed to victims from the USAO.”\na3 Villafafia understood the state prosecutors had set the December l4, 2oo7 date, and emailed them for\nconfirmation, stating, “[I]f the mater is set for the l4th, please let me knou so I can include that in my victim\nnotifications.”\n\n2l3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4l3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021414.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 34o 3536o38, Page242 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 24o of 348\nthe USAO’s interpretation of the agreement and “the use of Section 2255.” The Starr and\nLefkouitz leter asserted it was “wholly inappropriate” for the USAO to send the proposed victim\nnotification leter “under any circumstances,” and “strongly urg[ed]” Acosta to withhold the\nnotification leter until after the defense was able “to discuss this mater with Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Fisher.”\n\nThe follouing day, Sloman sent a leter to Lefkouitz, with copies to Acosta and Villafafia,\nasserting that the VRRA obligated the government to notify victims of the l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nproceedings as “other relief” to which they were entitled. Sloman also stated that the VRRA\nobligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning restitution to which\nthey may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice of the status of the investigation, the filing\nof charges, and the acceptance of a plea.*!4 (Emphasis in original). Sloman added:\n\nJust as in l8 U.S.C. § 377l [the CVRA], these sections are not\n\nlimited to proceedings in a federal district court. Our Non-\n\nProsecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by\n\nallouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense. The victims\n\nidentified through the federal investigation should be appropriately\n\ninformed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.*!°\nSloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafafia or the\nFBI case agent with questions or concerns: “Again, federal law requires that victims have the\n‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’” Sloman advised\nthe defense: “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed\nto Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation. Those questions are appropriately directed to\nlaw enforcement.”\n\nAlong with this leter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkouitz for comment a revised draft victim\nnotification leter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense. The\nleter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been completed,” Epstein would\nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of imprisonment at sentencing,\nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The\nleter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing:\n\nAs I mentioned above, as part of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal\n\ninvestigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.\n\nMr. Epstein’s change of plea and sentencing will occur on\n\nDecember l4, 2oo7, at a.m., before Judge Sandra K. McSorley,\n3l4 See 42 U.S.C. § lo6o7(c)(l)(B) and (c)(3).\n3l5 Emphasis in original. Sloman also stated that the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is\nsimply informing the victims of their rights.” Villafafia informed OPR that Sloman approved and signed the leter,\nbut she was the primary author of the document. OPR notes that Villafafia was the principal author of most\ncorrespondence in the Epstein case, and that follouing the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the leter went\nout with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three atorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence\nbefore a final version was sent to the defense.\n\n2l4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4l4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021416.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 349 3536o38, Page244 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 242 of 348\nher a victim for purposes of the federal charges, and continued to treat her as a victim because she\nwanted “to go above and beyond in terms of caring for the victims.”*!°\nE. December l9, 2oo7: Acosta Advises the Defense That the USAO Will Defer to\nthe State Atorney the Decision Whether to Notify Victims of the State Plea\nHearing, but the USAO Would Notify Them of the Federal <span class=\"highlight\">Resolution</span>, “as\nRequired by Law”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo7, Starr transmited to Acosta two lengthy submissions authored by\nLefkouitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to “the background and conduct of\nthe investigation” into Epstein. Regarding issues relevant to victim notification, in his transmital\nleter, Starr asserted that the “latest episodes involving [§] 2255 notification to the alleged victims\nput illustratively in bold relief our concerns that the ends of justice, time and time again, are not\nbeing served.” By way of example, Starr complained the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it\nwas clear from the girl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a\nvictim.”\n\nIn his submissions, Lefkouitz argued that the government was not required to notify\nvictims of the § 2255 provision:\n\nVillafafia’s decision to utilize a civil remedy statute in the place of\na restitution fund for the alleged victims eliminates the notification\nrequirement under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4, a federal law that\nrequires federal authorities to notify victims as to any available\nrestitution, not of any potential civil remedies. Despite this fact,\n[she] proposed a Victims Notification leter to be sent to the alleged\nfederal victims.\n\nLefkouitz also argued that a victim trust fund would provide a more appropriate\nmechanism for compensating the victims than the government’s proposed use of l8 U.S.C. § 2255,\nand a trust fund would not violate Epstein’s due process rights. Lefkouitz took issue with the\ngovernment’s “assertion” that the USAO was obligated to send a victim notification leter to the\nalleged victims, or even that it was appropriate for the USAO to do so. Lefkouitz further argued\nthat the government misinterpreted both the CVRA and the VRRA, because neither applied to a\npublic, state court proceeding involving the entry of a plea on state charges.\n\nIn a leter from Villafafia to Lefkouitz, responding to his allegations that she had\ncommited misconduct, she specifically addressed the “false” allegations that the government had\n3l8 As noted previously, in April 2oo7, this victim gave a video-recorded interview to the FBI that was favorable\nto Epstein.

Accordingly, the victim who became “Jane Doe #2” was not included on the victim list ultimately\nfurnished to the defense.

I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [victim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key conclusion that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> after development of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\nintention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\nconcluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.””?*°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, ‘“‘[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 Guidelines for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]Juidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l445", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021459.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 383 3536o39, Page29 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 283 of 348\nand consider victims’ views about, prospective plea negotiations.*°* The “prosecution stage”\nbegan when charges were filed and continued through all post-sentencing legal proceedings.*”\n\nAt the time the parties signed the NPA in September 2oo7, few courts had addressed victim\nstanding under the CVRA.

In a\nSeptember 6, 2oo7 email primarily addressing other topics, as the plea negotiations were beginning\nin earnest and almost three weeks before the NPA was signed, Villafafia raised the topic of victim\nconsultation with Sloman: “The agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their\napproval, which as [CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law. . . .\n[A]nd the [PBPD] Chief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.’”*™\nSloman forwarded the email to Acosta with a note stating, “fyi.” Villafafia recalled that after she\nsent the email, Sloman told her by telephone, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.’*° Villafafia also told\nOPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve been advised that . . . pre-\ncharge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Villafafia also recalled a discussion with\nAcosta, Menchel, and Sloman, during which she stated that she would need to get victims’ input\non the terms being proposed to the defense, and she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential.\nYou can’t disclose them.”*°°\n\nNone of the other subjects recalled a specific discussion before the NPA was signed about\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations. Menchel told OPR he believed the USAO was not required to\nconsult with victims during the preliminary “general discussion” phase of setlement negotiations;\nmoreover, he left the USAO before the terms of the NPA were fully developed.\n\nSloman told OPR that he “did not think that we had to consult with victims prior to entering\ninto the NPA” and ‘“‘we did not have to seek approval from victims to resolve a case.” Sloman\nbelieved the USAO was obligated only to notify victims about <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of “the cases that we\nhandled, filed cases.” Sloman recalled that because the USAO envisioned a state court <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>\nof the mater, he did not “think that that was a concern of ours at the time to consult with [the\nvictims] prior to entering into... the NPA.”\n\nLourie told OPR that he did not recall any discussions about informing the victims about\nthe terms of the NPA or any instructions to Villafafia that she not discuss the NPA with the victims.\nHe stated that everything the USAO did was “‘to try and get the best result as possible for the\nvictims. .. .

In addition, Villafafia’s reference to victim “approval” was inaccurate\nbecause the CVRA, even when applicable, requires only “consultation” with victims about prosecutorial decisions.\n\n4o5 Villafafia did not recall Sloman explaining the reason for the decision.\n\nlo8 Villatafia also told OPR that she recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations\ncould cause victims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.” Villafafia was\nuncertain of the date of the conversation, but Menchel’s presence requires it to have occurred before August 3, 2oo7.\n\n259\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l46l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021463.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 387 3536o39, Page33 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 287 of 348\nrequire victim approval of the prosecutors’ plans, but it allous victims the opportunity to express\ntheir views and to be heard before a final decision is made.

LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\n\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\n\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\n\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\n\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\n\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\n\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*?\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim Specialist. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\no8 Villatfafia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\nGuidelines, Art. IV, 4 B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners.

ACOSTA’S DECISION TO DEFER TO THE STATE ATTORNEY’S\n\nDISCRETION WHETHER TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT EPSTEIN’S STATE\n\nCOURT PLEA HEARING DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR OR UNAMBIGUOUS\n\nSTANDARD; HOWEVER, ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY\n\nFAILING TO ENSURE THAT VICTIMS IDENTIFIED IN THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION WERE ADVISED OF THE STATE PLEA HEARING\n\nAs set forth in the factual discussion, within a few weeks of the NPA’s signing, it became\nclear that the defense team disagreed with, and strongly objected to, the government’s plan to\ninform victims of their ability to recover monetary damages from Epstein, under the l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 provision of the NPA, and about Epstein’s state court plea hearing. The USAO initially\ntook the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA,\nincluding the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that\nvictims who wanted to atend could do so.\n\nIn November and December 2oo7, Epstein’s atorneys challenged the USAO’s position\nregarding victim notification. Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim\nnotifications. Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected\nto defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing\npursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights requirements. Acosta also determined that the USAO\nwould notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255,\na decision that was implemented by leters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.\nThis decision, which postponed notification of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas,\nwas based, at least in part, on Villafafia’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to\npreserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, belou.\n\nIn this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the responsibility for\nnotifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing. OPR concludes that neither the CVRA\nnor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore\nAcosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the discretion of the State\nAtorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing. Houever, OPR\nalso concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state\nintended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims\nforthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department. Through counsel, Acosta\n“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s conclusion and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard\n“never before expected of any U.S. Atorney.” OPR addresses Acosta’s criticisms in the\ndiscussion belou.\n\nA, Acosta’s Decision to Defer to the State Atorney’s Discretion Whether to\n\nNotify Victims about Epstein’s State Court Plea Hearing Did Not Violate Any\nClear or Unambiguous Standard\n\nIn November 2oo7, Villafafia sought to avoid defense accusations of misconduct\nconcerning her interactions with the victims by preparing a writen notice to victims informing\nthem of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal case and of their eligibility for monetary damages, and inviting\nthem to appear at the state plea hearing. Villafafia and Sloman exchanged edits of the draft leter\nand, at Sloman’s instruction, she provided the draft to defense atorney Lefkouitz, who, in turn,\n\n265\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l467", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021469.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 593 3536o39, Page39 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 293 of 348\n\nThereafter, in his December l9, 2oo7 leter to defense counsel mainly addressing other\nmaters, Acosta informed the defense that the USAO would defer to the State Atorney’s discretion\nthe responsibility for notifying victims about Epstein’s state plea hearing:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court [plea and]\nsentencing hearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim\nnotification leter and the statute. I would note that the United States\nprovided the draft leter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition,\nFirst Assistant United States Atorney Sloman already incorporated\nin the leter several edits that had been requested by defense counsel.\nlagree that Section 377l applies to notice of proceedings and results\nof investigations of federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We\nintend to provide victims with notice of the federal <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, as\nrequired by law. We will defer to the discretion of the State Atorney\nregarding whether he wishes to provide victims with notice of the\nstate proceedings, although we will provide him with the\ninformation necessary to do so if he wishes.\n(Emphasis added.)\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this [leter] without running it by [Sloman],\nif not other individuals in the office.” Acosta explained that it was “not for me to direct the State\nAtorney, or for our office to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to\nthe state outcome.” Acosta acknouledged that the USAO initially had concerns about the state’s\nhandling of the case, but he told OPR, “that doesn’t mean that they will not fulfill whatever\nobligation they have. Let’s not assume. . . that the State Atorney’s office is full of bad actors.”\nSloman initially believed that “the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially\nbecause they had restitution rights under [§] 2255”; but his expectations changed after “there was\nan agreement made that we were going to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to\ndecide hou the victims were going to be notified.”*’” Sloman told OPR he had been “proceeding\nunder the belief that we were going to notify the victims,” even though “this was not a federal\ncase,” but once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO “had concerns that if\nwe g[alve them the victim notification leter... and the deal fell apart, then the victims would be\ninstantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary compensation.”\n\nOPR could not determine whether the State Atorney’s Office notified any victims in\nadvance of the June 3o, 2oo8 state plea hearing. Krischer told OPR that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad a robust and effective victim notification process and staff, but he was not aware of whether\nor hou it was used in the Epstein case. Belohlavek told OPR that she could not recall whether\nvictims were notified of the hearing nor whether the state law required notification for the\na Sloman stated in his June 3, 2oo8 leter to Deputy Atorney General Filip that Acosta made the decision\ntogether with the Department’s Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker. Acosta did consult\nwith Mandelker about the § 2255 civil damages recovery process, but neither Acosta nor Mandelker recalled\ndiscussing the issue of victim notification, and OPR found no other documentation indicating that Mandelker played\na role in the deferral decision.\n\n267\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l469", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021470.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 359o4 3536o39, Page4o of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 294 of 348\nparticular charges and victims at issue. Once the hearing was scheduled, Sloman told Villafafia to\ncontact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2oo8, she reported back\nto Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”*'* Villafafia recalled that she\nsent Reiter a list of the girls identified as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said\nhe would “contact as many as he could.” The contemporaneous records do not shou hou many\nor which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom. No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials. At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding. Accordingly, Villafafia, who was present in the courtroom for the\nhearing, had no knouledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims\nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.”*!”\n\nOPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Atorney’s Office the\ndecision to notify victims of the scheduled date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional\nmisconduct. OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*”° Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l (a)(2)).77\"\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*”\n\n4l8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n4l9 Plea Hearing Transcript at 42.\n42o OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v.

It also ultimately created the misimpression that the Department intentionally\nsought to silence the victims by keeping them uninformed about the NPA and the resulting state\nproceeding.

VILLAFANA DID NOT COMMIT PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT IN HER\nORAL COMMUNICATIONS TO VICTIMS AND VICTIMS’ ATTORNEYS, IN\nWHICH SHE DESCRIBED THE CASE AS “UNDER INVESTIGATION” BUT DID\nNOT DISCLOSE THE EXISTENCE OF THE NPA TO SOME VICTIMS\nFrom September 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, until after Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\n\nstate court plea, the case agents, acting under Villafafia’s direction, directly informed only three\n\nvictims that the government had signed an NPA and that, if Epstein complied with its terms, the\nfederal investigation would be closed. During this time period, Villafafia and the case agents\ninteracted with several victims and their atorneys, and Villafafia contacted victims’ atorney\n\nBradley Edwards to encourage him to atend the state court plea hearing, but she did not inform\n\nvictims or Edwards of the NPA or the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal investigation.\n\nAs described in Part One of this chapter, after the NPA was signed, the FBI case agent and\nco-case agent began notifying victims about the NPA.**° After speaking to three victims, houever,\nthe FBI case agent became concerned that informing the victims about the NPA and the monetary\ndamages provision would create potential impeachment material for the victims and the agent\nshould Epstein breach the NPA and the case proceed to indictment and trial. As the case agent\ntold OPR, “I would . . . have to testify that I told every one of these girls that they could sue\nMr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think it was right.” The case\n2o Although Wild disputed that she was informed of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal case, the case agent’s email to\nVillafafia from this time period reflects that at least one victim understood that the federal case was resolved and that\nshe was unhappy with the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>.\n\n273\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l475", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021476.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ER 3oo 3536o39, Page46 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3oo of 348\nagent and Villafafia consulted with the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer about the\nmater, and thereafter stopped notifying the victims about the NPA and their ability to pursue\nmonetary damages according to its terms.\n\nVillafafia advised Sloman by email of her concerns regarding the potential impeachment\nevidence, telling him, “One thing I am concerned about is that, if we [file charges] nou, cross-\nexamination will consist of- ‘and the government told you that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are\nentitled to a large amount of damages right?’” Explaining the decision in her later CVRA\ndeclaration, Villafafia said that after Epstein’s atorneys “complained that the victims were\nreceiving an incentive to overstate their involvement with Mr. Epstein in order to increase their\ndamages claims,” she “concluded that informing additional victims could compromise the\nwitnesses’ credibility at trial if Epstein reneged on the agreement.” Acosta was aware of these\nconcerns as he referred to them in an August 2oo8 email, “[W]e also believed that contacting the\nvictims would compromise them as potential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they\nwere doing this for the money, and we did not want to discuss liability with them, which was [a]\nkey part of [the] agree[ment].”\n\nThe case agents interviewed victims in October and November 2oo7, but did not inform\nthem about the NPA.**! On January 3l, 2oo8, the FBI agents, Villafafia, and the CEOS Trial\nAtorney interviewed three victims, including Courtney Wild, and they interviewed at least one\nmore victim the next day.**? Wild and two others had been contacted by the FBI in the fall of\n2oo7 and may have been informed about the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal investigation.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that during the January 3l, 2oo8 interviews, she did not specifically\ntell the victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had these terms.” She\nstated that she would not use “terminology” such as “NPA” because “most people don’t understand\nwhat that means.” Instead, with respect to the three victims who, according to Villafafia, had been\ninformed by the FBI about the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, she stated that “an agreement had been reached where\n[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look [like] he intends to actually\nperform . . . [and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged . . . and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled telling some victims that Epstein “was supposed to enter a plea in state court”\nthat would end the investigation, but she did not recall distinguishing between the “federal\ninvestigation versus a state investigation.” Villafafia told OPR she explained “the case was under\ninvestigation,” she and the agents “were preparing . . . again” to file charges, and they hoped “that\ncharges would be brought.” An email from Villafafia to Sloman and Acosta during this time period\nreflects that she had such discussions with at least one victim interviewed on this date: “The\nsecond girl... was very upset about the l8 month deal she had read about in the paper... .\n[S]he would rather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time in jail.” Villafafia,\nhouever, did not recall telling all of the victims interviewed at this time of the state plea; rather,\nshe likely only told those who knew about the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> from the FBI. In her oun 2ol5 CVRA-\ncase declaration, Wild stated that she “was not told about any [NPA] or any potential <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of\nel FBI agents also interviewed victims in March and May of 2oo8, without prosecutors, and did not inform the\nvictims of the NPA.\nad Two additional victims were scheduled to be interviewed on February l, 2oo8, but the evidence is unclear as\nto whether the interviews occurred.\n\n274\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l476", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021481.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o5 3536o39, Pagedl of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o5 of 348\nand they often cannot fully reveal either the facts or the status of an investigation, even with\nvictims. The 2oo5 Guidelines advise that in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited\nin their disclosures: “Because victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government,\nand may disclose whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only nonsensitive data and\npublic information.”*?\n\nVillafafia’s concern about generating potential impeachment evidence by informing\nvictims of their potential to recover monetary damages from Epstein was not unreasonable.\nIndeed, the case agents initially raised the impeachment issue, and after considering the problem,\nVillafafia agreed with the agents’ concerns. Villafafia raised those concerns with the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer in October 2oo7 after the agents brought the issue to her\natention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom\nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound. OPR also considered that although\nVillafafia had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her\nsupervisor, the U.S. Atorney, had decided otherwise. When authorized to inform Edwards of the\nscheduled change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) atendance at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).4* Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential conclusion of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\n443 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV, 9 B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim notification leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\nee The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of a sex abuse case. Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l48l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021482.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o6 3536o39, Paged2 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o6 of 348\nintentionally concealing information from them and was part of a series of interactions with\nvictims that led to condemnation of the government’s treatment of victims.**°\nVI. THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO TREAT VICTIMS FORTHRIGHTLY AND\n\nWITH SENSITIVITY WHEN IT FAILED TO TIMELY PROVIDE VICTIMS\n\nWITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE <span class=\"highlight\">RESOLUTION</span> OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAlthough OPR does not conclude that any of the subjects commited professional\nmisconduct, either by failing to consult with the victims before the NPA was signed or in\ninteractions afterwards, OPR’s findings are not an endorsement of the government’s course of\naction. The government’s interactions with victims confused and frustrated many of the victims,\nparticularly the two CVRA petitioners and the two victims who had unsuccessfully atempted to\njoin in the CVRA litigation. As a result, the victims’ and the public’s perception of the mater is\nthat the prosecutors worked with Epstein’s atorneys to disenfranchise and silence the victims. It\nis unfortunate, and appears fundamentally unfair to the victims, that Acosta and Sloman (after\nMenchel and Lourie departed) took the unusual step of deciding to vet the USAO victim\nnotification leters with the defense after the NPA was signed, but failed to go beyond the\nrequirements of the CVRA or the 2oo5 Guidelines to consult with the victims before the NPA was\nsigned. This result is contrary to the Department’s intent, as set forth in the 2oo5 Guidelines, that\nDepartment employees work to “minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of crime\nendure in its wake.” When considering the entirety of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by\nthe Department.\n\nWild’s criticisms of the government’s conduct were based on interactions that are similar\nto and generally representative of the government’s interactions with other Epstein victims and\nthat demonstrate an overall lack of sensitivity to the victims by the government. Wild experienced\na series of confusing and inconsistent communications in her interactions with Villafafia and the\ncase agents. Wild received Villafafia’s leter in June 2oo7 stating inaccurately that she was a\nfederal victim entitled to CVRA rights. She was interviewed by the FBI in August 2oo7 but was\nnot told that a potential outcome was a state plea. Shortly after the September 24, 2oo7 signing of\nthe NPA, the FBI contacted her to inform her of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal case. Nonetheless,\non January lo, 2oo8, the FBI sent her a victims’ rights leter indicating that the case was under\ninvestigation and that some of her CVRA rights may not apply until after the defendant was\ncharged. On January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia re-interviewed Wild, along with a CEOS atorney and\nthe FBI agents, and told Wild that the case was under investigation, but did not specifically mention\nthe NPA, although she may have mentioned a possible <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. In mid-June 2oo8, when\nEdwards contacted Villafafia on Wild’s behalf, Villafafia informed him that the case was under\ninvestigation but did not mention the NPA. Just before Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8 state court plea,\n445 OPR notes that, similar to Villafafia, Sloman interacted with a victim’s atorney during the time period\nbetween the signing of the NPA and Epstein’s state guilty plea. In January 2oo8, Sloman received a telephone call\nfrom his former law partner, who represented one of the victims and who asked Sloman whether the federal\ngovernment could bring charges against Epstein. Sloman, concerned about the potential for conflict of interest\nallegations due to his prior business relations with the atorney, refused to answer any questions regarding Epstein.\nBecause Sloman refused to provide any information, OPR found no basis for finding that Sloman misled the atorney.\n\n28o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l482", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021486.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OR 3lo 3536o39, Paged6 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3lo of 348\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l486", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021487.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON STL 3536o39, Paged/7 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3ll of 348\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into\nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation\nwithout a federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department\ndid not interpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the\nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before\ncriminal charges were brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation\nwas for the purpose of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series\nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of\nthe government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is\ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims\nof a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\n285\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l487", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021557.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 38l 3536o39, Pagel27 of 2l7\nl2\nM6SOmaxl\nl objection is overruled.

The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged\nin illegal sexual activity with girls.' OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors commited\nprofessional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was\nsigned or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.\nl. OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein\nin 2oo5, after the parents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.\nEpstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and\nother United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an Assistant U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. Ata July 3l,\n2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if Epstein pled\nguilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration, registered as a\nsexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain monetary\ndamages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications with\nEpstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7.

The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and secking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\n2 Emergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C.

Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the Epstein case\nbe made public.

After the court’s order, the Department\nrecused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nNorthern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government. Among the remedies sought\nby the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained\na federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and\none count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. The indictment alleged that from\n2oo2 until 2oo5, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida\nwhom he sexually abused and exploited. Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2ol9. In\narguing for Epstein’s pretrial detention, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein’s\nManhatan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least\none believed to be a minor.

The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged\nin illegal sexual activity with girls.! OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors commited\nprofessional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was\nsigned or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.\nl. OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein\nin 2oo5, after the parents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.\nEpstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and\nother United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an Assistant U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. At a\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if\nEpstein pled guilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration,\nregistered as a sexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain\nmonetary damages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications\nwith Epstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7. The\n! As used in this Report, including in quoted documents and statements, the word “girls” refers to females who\nwere under the age of l8 at the time of the alleged conduct. Under Florida law, a minor is a person under the age\nof l8.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23ol5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023016.jpg": "NPA required Epstein to plead guilty in state court to the then-pending state indictment against\nhim and to an additional criminal information charging him with a state offense that would require\nhim to register as a sexual offender—specifically, procurement of minors to engage in prostitution,\nin violation of Florida Statute § 796.o3. The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and secking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\n2 Emergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.? The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

The Miami Herald report led to public outrage and media scrutiny of the\ngovernment’s actions.*\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the CVRA case petitioners’ Motion for\nPartial Summary Judgment, ruling that the government violated the CVRA in failing to advise the\nvictims about its intention to enter into the NPA.° The court also found that leters the government\nsent to victims after the NPA was signed, describing the investigation as ongoing, “mislead [sic]\nthe victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility.” The court also highlighted\nthe inequity of the USAO’s failure to communicate with the victims while at the same time\nengaging in “lengthy negotiations” with Epstein’s counsel and assuring the defense that the NPA\nwould not be “made public or filed with the court.” The court ordered the parties to submit\nadditional briefs regarding the appropriate remedies. After the court’s order, the Department\nrecused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nNorthern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government. Among the remedies sought\nby the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained\na federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and\none count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. The indictment alleged that from\n2oo2 until 2oo5, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida\nwhom he sexually abused and exploited. Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2ol9. In\narguing for Epstein’s pretrial detention, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein’s\nManhatan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least\none believed to be a minor. The court ordered Epstein detained pending trial, and he was remanded\nto the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in\nManhatan.\n\nMeanwhile, after publication of the November 2ol8 Miami Herald report, the media and\nCongress increasingly focused atention on Acosta as the government official responsible for the\nNPA. On July lo, 2ol9, Acosta held a televised press conference to defend his and the USAO’s\nactions. Acosta stated that the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office “was ready to allou Epstein to\nwalk free with no jail time, nothing.” According to Acosta, because USAO prosecutors considered\nthis outcome unacceptable, his office pursued a difficult and challenging case and obtained a\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> that put Epstein in jail, forced him to register as a sexual offender, and provided victims\nwith the means to obtain monetary damages.

Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home,\nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a\ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments. The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, “Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.”®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.”\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\n8 Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n° In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o52", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023065.jpg": "recalled generally having conversations with Sloman and Menchel about the Epstein case, but he\ncould not recall with specificity when those conversations took place or the details of the\ndiscussions.\n\nSloman told OPR that because of his broad responsibilities as FAUSA, he left it to\nMenchel, as a highly experienced trial atorney and the Criminal Division Chief, to work directly\nwith Acosta, and Sloman recalled that it was Menchel and Lourie who conducted a “granular\nreview” of the charging package. Acosta confirmed to OPR that Sloman and Menchel “were a\nteam” who became involved in issues as needed, and if Sloman perceived that Menchel was taking\nthe lead on the Epstein mater, Sloman may have deferred to Menchel.\n\nC. May — June 2oo7: Miami Managers Consider the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nand Proposed Charges\n\nWhen she submited the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia intended to file charges by\nMay l5, 2oo7, and the FBI planned to arrest Epstein immediately thereafter. Villafafia, houever,\nhad not obtained authorization to indict on that schedule. The managers in Miami wanted time to\nanalyze the lengthy prosecution memorandum and consider the potential charges and charging\nstrategy. Just a few days after he received the prosecution memorandum, and after learning that\nthe FBI was planning a press conference for May l5, Sloman advised Villafafia that “[t]his Office\nhas not approved the indictment. Therefore, please do not commit us to anything at this time.’3%\n\nOn May lo, 2oo7, with Menchel’s concurrence, Lourie sent a copy of Villafafia’s\nprosecution memorandum to CEOS Chief Andrew Oosterban, who in turn sent it to his deputy\nand another CEOS atorney, asking them to assess the legal issues involved in the case and\ndescribing it as a “highly sensitive” case involving “a high profile, very rich defendant.”*? After\nCEOS reviewed the materials, Oosterban responded to Lourie with an email stating that the\nmemorandum was “exhaustive” and “well done” and noting that Villafafia “has correctly focused\non the issues as we see them.””’ He summarized CEOS’s analysis of the application of key facts to\nthe statutes she proposed charging, concurring in Villafafia’s assessments but noting that further\nresearch was needed to determine whether certain statutes required proof of a defendant’s\nknouledge of victims’ ages. Oosterban offered to assign a CEOS atorney to work with Villafafia\non the case. Lourie forwarded Oosterban’s email to Menchel and Villafafia.\n\nMeanwhile, contemporaneous emails shou that Lourie, at least, was already considering\nan early <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the case through a pre-indictment plea agreement.*” After Lourie spoke with\n38 Lourie later reported to Menchel that the FBI had “wanted to arrest [Epstein] in [the] Virgin Islands during a\nbeauty pageant ... where he is a judge.” The case agent recalled that she and her co-case agent were disappointed\nwith the decision, and that the Supervisory Special Agent was “extremely upset” about it. After the federal\ninvestigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2oo6, Epstein largely stayed\naway from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.\n\n32 Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterban was an AUSA at the USAO for about ten years and was good\nfriends with Lourie.\n4o In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it “may\nundermine our arguments for pretrial detention.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening\na bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o65", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023066.jpg": "the FBI squad supervisor on May 9, 2oo7, to explain that charges against Epstein would not be\nquickly approved, he reported to Menchel that the FBI was “not happy” about the delay, adding,\n“T did not even tell them I think we should bring [Epstein] in, once we decide to charge him, and\noffer a pre-indictment deal, figuring a judge might never agree to such a deal post indictment. That\nwould have sent them thru the roof.” Lourie explained to OPR that he thought a judge, after seeing\nan indictment charging the full nature and scope of Epstein’s conduct, might not agree to a plea\ninvolving substantially less time or to dismiss substantive charges.\"!\n\nLourie told OPR that despite Oosterban’s favorable opinion of the case, “[t]his was ...a\nbit of uncharted territory,” involving facts that were unlike the case law Oosterban had cited.\nAlthough Lourie had some concerns about the legal issues and about the witnesses, he “probably”\ndid not see any impediment to going forward with the case; in fact, Lourie “was not in favor of\nwalking away, which is what the defense wanted [the USAO] to do.” But while Lourie “thought\nwe could have won and we could have prevailed through appeal,” he “didn’t think the odds were\nnearly as good as you want in a criminal case, and . . . the things that we had to gain [through a\nplea agreement] were much more than [in] a normal criminal case,” in which the only cost of a\nloss would be that the defendant did not go to jail. Lourie told OPR that to the best of his\nrecollection, he thought a plea agreement would be a good result, and although the government\nmight have to “give up some jail time,” there were other benefits to a plea, such as the ability to\nrequire Epstein to register as a sex offender and the availability of monetary damages for the\nvictims. Lourie recalled “thinking that this case should setle and we should set it up so we can\nsetle it” by, for example, charging Epstein by complaint and then negotiating a plea to limited\ncharges in a criminal information. Villafafia told OPR that she agreed with Lourie that a criminal\ncomplaint charging an “omnibus conspiracy” containing “all of the information related to what the\ncase was about” would be a good way to “get things moving” touard a pre-indictment plea.\n\nAlthough Lourie and Villafafia believed a pre-indictment plea agreement was a desired\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, there was no guarantee that Epstein would agree to plead guilty, and they continued to\nwork together to shape an indictment. On May lo, 2oo7, Lourie emailed Villafafia:\n\n[Marie\n\nI believe that Epstein’s at[orneys] are scared of the victims they\n\ndon’t knou. Epstein has no doubt told them that there were many.\n\nThus I believe the flir]st indictment should contain only the victims\n\nthey have nothing on at all. We can add in the other ones that have\n\nmyspace [sic] pages and prior testimony in a [superseding\n\nindictment]. I think for the first strike we should make all their\n\nnightmare[]s come true. Thoughts?”\n4 Lourie explained to OPR that the government’s dismissal of counts in an indictment required the court’s\napproval, and that, while “it’s rare,” it was possible that a judge, seeing the nature and extent of Epstein’s conduct as\nset forth in an extensive indictment, might not allou substantive counts to be dismissed.\n2 Lourie’s references to MySpace pages and “prior testimony” referred to the impeachment information\nbrought forward by defense counsel.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o66", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023067.jpg": "Lourie folloued up his email to Villafafia with one to Menchel, in which Lourie reiterated\nthe potential benefits of a pre-indictment plea, explaining that he and Villafafia believed “the best\nthing to do is charge Epstein by complaint, assuming we decide to charge him. . .. The\n[sentencing] guidelines will be in the 2o year range, so we would need to plead him to one or two\nconspiracies to cap him and there is no telling if a judge would go for that once we indict.”\nMenchel responded that he and Acosta would read the prosecution memorandum and “[w]e can\ndiscuss after that.”\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia sent Lourie an email, which Lourie forwarded to Menchel,\nexplaining that a “conservative calculation” of Epstein’s potential sentencing exposure under the\nU.S. Sentencing Guidelines would be l68 to 2lo months, and that in her view, the facts warranted\nan upward departure from that range. Villafafia told OPR that although Lourie proposed some\nchanges to the draft indictment, at that point no one had told her that the evidence was insufficient\nto support the proposed charges or that the office did not want to go forward with the case.\n\nIn an email to Acosta and Menchel on May ll, 2oo7, Lourie recommended charging\nEpstein by complaint and seeking a pre-indictment plea:\n\nMy current thoughts are that we should charge him. Not sure that I\nagree with the charging strategy as it is nou, but at this point I think\nwe only need to get on the same page as to whether the statutes cover\nthe conduct and whether the conduct is the type we should charge.\nI think the answer to both is yes, although there is some risk on some\nof the statutes as this is uncharted territory to some degree. We can\ndecide later what the [charging document] should look like precisely\nand which victims should be charged.\n\nI also think if we choose to go forward, we should start with a\ncomplaint, arrest him, detain him . . . and then try to see if he wants\na pre-indictment <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. That would give us more control [over]\na plea than if we indict him and need the court’s approval to dismiss\ncounts. We will need to cap him with conspiracy counts to make a\nplea atractive and the court could give us a hard time with that if we\ntry to dismiss indicted counts.\n\nAlthough her supervisors were communicating among themselves about the case, Villafafia\nwas unaware of those discussions and was frustrated that she was not receiving more feedback.\nShe continued preparing to charge Epstein. Two weeks after submiting the prosecution\nmemorandum, on May l4, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Lourie and Menchel by email that Epstein\nwas flying to New Jersey from the Virgin Islands, and she asked whether she could file charges\nthe next day. Menchel responded that “[y]ou will not have approval to go forward tomorrou,”\nand explained that Acosta “has your [prosecution] memo,” but was at an out-of-toun conference,\nadding, “This is obviously a very significant case and [A]lex wants to take his time making sure\n43 Lourie told OPR that he was referring to one or two counts of conspiracy under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, the general\n“omnibus” federal conspiracy statute that carries a maximum sentence of five years.\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o67", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023074.jpg": "damages.°>> During a two-month period, the subject atorneys were involved to varying degrees in\nconverting the broad outline into specific terms, resulting in the NPA signed by Epstein on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both\nthe larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of\nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the\nfacts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> or the NPA.\n\nIn the follouing account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous\ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR\nquestioned each of the subjects about hou the decision was reached to pursue a state <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>,\nand OPR includes belou the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA. June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea <span class=\"highlight\">Resolution</span>, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> shortly thereafter.”°° In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal investigation that could\nae State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw enforcement and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities. The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry\nis administered by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n56 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o74", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023075.jpg": "include concurrent time.” The email primarily concerned other issues, and Villafafia did not\nexplain what the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> she had in mind would entail.*’ Villafafia requested to be advised,\n“i]f anyone has communicated anything to Epstein’s atorneys that is contrary to this.” Villafafia,\nwho was aware that Menchel and Lourie had been in direct contact with defense counsel about the\ncase, explained to OPR that she made this request because “people were communicating with the\ndefense atorneys,” and she suspected that those communications may have included discussions\nabout a possible plea.\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s email, Menchel notified Villafafia that he had told Sanchez “a\nstate plea [with] jail time and sex offender status may satisfy the [U.S. Atorney], but Sanchez\nhad responded that it “was a non-starter for them.”°® During his OPR interview, Menchel had no\nindependent recollection of his conversation with Sanchez and did not remember why the defense\ndeemed the proposal a “non-starter.”” Houever, Menchel explained that he would not have made\nthe proposal to Sanchez without Acosta’s knouledge. He also pointed out that in numerous emails\nbefore the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, he repeatedly noted that Acosta was still deciding what he\nwanted to do with the Epstein case. Acosta agreed, telling OPR that although he did not remember\na specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, Menchel would not have\ndiscussed a potential <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> with Sanchez “without having discussed it with me.”\n\nl. Acosta’s Explanation for His Decision to Pursue a State-based\n<span class=\"highlight\">Resolution</span>\n\nSubsequent events shoued that the decision to resolve the case through state charges was\npivotal, and OPR extensively questioned Acosta about his reasoning. In his OPR interview, Acosta\nexplained the various factors that influenced his decision to pursue a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. Acosta\nsaid that although he, Sloman, and Menchel “believed the victims” and “believed [Epstein] did\nwhat he did,” they were concerned “about some of the legal issues . . . and some of the issues in\nterms of testimony.”°? Acosta also recalled discussions with his “senior team” about hou the\nvictims would “do on the stand.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “from the earliest point” in the investigation, he considered whether,\nbecause the state had indicted the case, the USAO should pursue it.\n\na Villafafia explained to OPR that she intended to recommend a plea to a federal conspiracy charge and a\nsubstantive charge, “consistent with the Ashcroft Memo, which would be the most readily provable offense,” with “a\nrecommendation that the sentence on the federal charges run concurrent with the state sentence, or that [Epstein]\nwould receive credit for time in state custody touards his federal release date.” See n.65 for an explanation of the\nAshcroft Memo.\n\npe Villafafia was then in trial and on July 4, 2oo7, likely before reading Menchel’s email, Villafafia responded\nto defense counsel regarding the demand for records and also noted, “If you would like to discuss the possibility of a\nfederal <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> . . . that could run concurrently with any state <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, please leave a message on my voicemail.”\n9° In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Sloman stated he had no involvement in assessing the Epstein case or\ndeciding hou to resolve it, and that OPR should not identify him as among the people upon whom Acosta relied in\nreaching the two-year-state-plea <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> through the NPA. Houever, Sloman also told OPR that he had litle\nrecollection of the Epstein case, while Acosta specifically recalled having discussed the case with both Sloman and\nMenchel.\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o75", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023077.jpg": "I do think it’s important to look back on this, and try to be in the\nshoes of the thought process in 2oo6 and ’o7 when trafficking\nprosecutions were fairly new, when . . . more so than today, some\njurors may have looked at this as prostitution, and . . . [a] judge’s\ntolerance for victim shaming may have . . . caused more hesitation\non the part of victims... .&\nFinally, Acosta told OPR that a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> offered more flexibility in fashioning\na sentence, because he believed prosecutors would have difficulty persuading a federal district\ncourt in the Southern District of Florida to approve a federal plea for a stipulated binding sentence\nthat differed from the otherwise applicable federal sentencing guidelines range.°*\nIn summarizing his thinking at the time, Acosta told OPR,\nThe way the mater came to the office was, the state wasn’t doing\nenough. It didn’t provide for prison time. It didn’t provide for\nregistration, and then you had the restitution issue. There were legal\nissues .... There were witness issues. And... we could go to trial\n...and we may or may not prevail. Alternatively, we could look at\na pre-indictment <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, and at various points, the office went\nback and forth between a federal pre-indictment <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, and a\nstate pre-indictment <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>.\nAcosta told OPR that, in the end, “there was a preference for deferring to the state” because, in\npart, the facts of the Epstein case at the time appeared to constitute solicitation or prostitution\nrather than trafficking, and a federal prosecution would be “uncharted territory.” Acosta explained\nthat he did not view it as problematic to defer <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the case to the state, although as the\nEpstein case played out, the federal role became “more intrusive” than he had anticipated, because\nthe defense tried to get the state to “circumvent and undermine” the outcome.\nAtorney’s Office could have proceeded against Epstein by way of an information, but decided to go into the grand\njury because the State Atorney’s Office “didn’t like the case” and wanted “political cover” for declining the case or\nproceeding on a lesser charge.\n83 Menchel told OPR, houever, that the federal judges in West Palm Beach were highly regarded and were\ngenerally viewed as “pro-prosecution.”\nom Acosta said that “dismissing a number of counts and then doing a [R]ule ll is not something that [South\nFlorida federal district] judges tend to do.” Other subjects also told OPR that the federal judges in the Southern District\nof Florida were generally considered averse to pleas that bound them on sentencing, commonly referred to as “Rule\nll(c) pleas.”\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) allous the parties to agree on a specific sentence as part of\na plea agreement. The court is required to impose that sentence if the court accepts the plea agreement; if the court\ndoes not accept the agreed upon plea and sentence, the agreement is void. Villafafia told OPR that Rule ll(c) pleas\nwere “uncommon” in the Southern District of Florida, as the “judges do not like to be told . . . what sentence to\nimpose.” Menchel similarly told OPR that the USAO viewed federal judges in the Southern District of Florida as\naverse to Rule ll(c) pleas, although Menchel had negotiated such pleas. Villafafia told OPR that she had never offered\na Rule ll(c) plea in any of her cases and had no experience with such pleas.\n39\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o77", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023078.jpg": "Menchel could not recall who initially suggested a state plea, but noted to OPR that his\noun “emails... make clear that this course of action was ultimately decided by Alex Acosta.” He\nreferenced, among others, his May l4, 2oo7 email to Villafafia informing her that Acosta was\ndeciding hou he wanted to handle the case. Menchel surmised that a state <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> accomplished\ntwo things that Acosta viewed as important: first, it resolved any Petite policy concerns, and\nsecond, it afforded more flexibility in sentencing than a federal plea would have alloued. Menchel\ntold OPR that the state plea proposal did not reflect any minimization of Epstein’s conduct and\nthat any state plea would have been to an offense that required sexual offender registration. He\ntold OPR, “I don’t think anybody sat around and said, you knou, it’s not that big a deal. That was\nnot the reaction that I think anybody had from the federal side of this case.” Rather, Menchel said,\n“The concern was if we charge him [as proposed], there’s going to be a trial.”\n\n2. July 2oo7: Villafaia and Menchel Disagree about the Proposed State\n<span class=\"highlight\">Resolution</span>\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she was angry when she received Menchel’s July email explaining\nthat he had proposed to Sanchez resolving the federal investigation through a state plea. In\nVillafafia’s view, the proposed state <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> “didn’t make any sense” and “did not correspond”\nto Department policy requiring that a plea offer reflect “the most serious readily provable\noffense.”® In her view, a plea to a state charge “obviously” would not satisfy this policy. Villafafia\nalso told OPR that in her view, the USAM required the USAO to confer with the investigative\nagency about plea negotiations, and Villafafia did not believe the FBI would be in favor of a state\nplea. Villafafia also believed the CVRA required atorneys for the government to confer with\nvictims before making a plea offer, but the victims had not been consulted about this proposal.\nVillafafia told OPR she had met with some of the victims during the course of the investigation\nwho had negative impressions of the State Atorney’s Office, and she believed that “sending them\nback to the State Atorney’s Office was not something” those victims would support.\n\n& This policy was set forth in a September 22, 2oo3 memorandum from then Atorney General John Ashcroft\nregarding “Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and Sentencing”\n(knoun as the “Ashcroft Memo”), which provided, in pertinent part:\n\n[I]n all federal criminal cases, federal prosecutors must charge and pursue the\n\nmost serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts\n\nof the case, except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, United States\n\nAtorney, or designated supervisory atorney in the limited circumstances\n\ndescribed belou. The most serious offense or offenses are those that generate the\n\nmost substantial sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, unless a mandatory\n\nminimum sentence or count requiring a consecutive sentence would generate a\n\nlonger sentence. A charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor has a good\n\nfaith doubt, for legal or evidentiary reasons, as to the Government’s ability readily\n\nto prove a charge at trial. Thus, charges should not be filed simply to exert\n\nleverage to induce a plea. Once filed, the most serious readily provable charges\n\nmay not be dismissed except to the extent permited [elsewhere in this\n\nMemorandum].\nSee also Chapter Two, Part Two, Section II.B.l.\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o78", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023079.jpg": "In light of these concerns, Villafafia emailed Menchel, expressing her strong disagreement\nwith the process:\n\n[I]t is inappropriate for you to enter into plea negotiations without\nconsulting with me or the investigative agencies, and it is more\ninappropriate to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE [Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement], the victims, and me. These plea negotiations violate\nthe Ashcroft memo, the U.S. Atorney[s’] Manual, and all of the\nvarious iterations of the victims’ rights legislation. Strategically,\nyou have started the plea negotiations as though we are in a position\nof weakness, anxious to make the case go away, by telling the\ndefense that we will demand no federal conviction. We left the\nmeeting on June 26th in a stronger position than when we entered,\nand your statement that a state <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> would satisfy us takes\naway that advantage. If you make it seem like the U.S. Atorney\ndoesn’t have faith in our investigation, Epstein has no incentive to\nmake a deal.\n\nSecond, your discussion makes it appear that my investigation is for\n“shou” only and completely undermines my ability to deal with\nEpstein’s atorneys directly. ...\n\nI would like to make a presentation to the U.S. Atomey, Jeff\n[Sloman], Andy [Lourie], and you with our side of the investigation\nand a revised indictment. The presentation will address the points\nraised by Epstein’s counsel and will convince you all of the strength\nof the case.\n\nIn the meantime, please direct all communications from Epstein’s\ncounsel to me.\n\nMenchel told OPR he realized Villafafia was “very anxious” to file charges in the case.\nVillafafia had put a “tremendous” amount of effort into the investigation, and Menchel “was not\nunsympathetic at all to her desires” to pursue a federal case. Houever, as Menchel told OPR,\nVillafafia’s supervisors, including Acosta, were “trying to be a litle bit more dispassionate,” and\nher urgency was “not respectful” of Acosta’s position. Menchel viewed the tone of Villafafia’s\nemail as “highly unacceptable,” and her understanding of applicable law and policy incorrect. In\nparticular, Menchel pointed out that although the Ashcroft Memo requires prosecutors to charge\nthe “most readily provable offense,” there is nevertheless room for “flexibility,” and that the U.S.\nAtorney has discretion—directly or through a designated supervisor such as Menchel—to waive\nthe policy.\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o79", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023084.jpg": "Early in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>” to the case would soon be reached.” Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n2 In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

The\ncontemporaneous emails make no mention of any rationale for the decision to propose two years\nas the government’s beginning negotiating position, and nobody with whom OPR spoke was able\nto recall hou the decision was made. As discussed belou, Acosta did offer OPR an explanation,\nbut OPR was unable to find contemporaneous evidence supporting it.”\n\nWhile the defense was communicating its objections to the federal investigation to\nVillafafia, Lourie, Menchel, and Sloman, Villafafia continued moving touard filing charges. On\nJuly l9, 2oo7, the day after receiving Oosterban’s email supporting a potential prosecution,\nVillafafia emailed Lourie and Menchel seeking approval to take further investigative steps\nregarding three of Epstein’s assistants. Houever, Menchel directed Villafafia to “hold off... until\nwe decide what course of action we are going to take on [E]pstein which should happen next\nweek.” Menchel told OPR that he did not specifically recall why he asked Villafafia to wait, but\nhe assumed it was because Acosta was deciding what course of action to take on the case.\n\nOn Monday, July 23, 2oo7, Menchel submited a resignation notice to Acosta, stating that\nhe would be leaving the USAO effective August 6, 2oo7.77\n\nl.

Menchel told OPR\nthat the fact that he had both proposed revisions to the indictment and also directed Villafafia to\ndelay the investigative steps involving the assistants indicated that he was “trying to do something”\nwith the case, but was waiting for Acosta to decide the “underlying issue” of whether to proceed\nwith federal charges.\n\nAcosta made that decision on or before July 26, 2oo7. On that afternoon, Villafafia met in\nMiami with Menchel. She told OPR that Sloman, as well as the FBI case agents and their\nsupervisors, were also present, with Lourie participating by telephone. Villafafia told OPR that\nshe expected that the meeting, requested by Menchel, would address the direction of the\ninvestigation.

Acosta told OPR that he had “decided and endorsed this <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> at\nsome point,” but he did not recall being aware that Menchel was going to announce the decision\nat the July 26 meeting; in addition, although Acosta did not recall the circumstances of Menchel’s\nrelaying of that decision, he said it “would have been consistent with” his decision for Menchel to\ndo so.

Villafafia also told OPR that\nMenchel provided no explanation for this decision during the July 26, 2oo7 meeting, and Villafafia\ndid not ask for an explanation because she accepted his statement that it was Acosta’s decision.\nVillafafia described the proposal as “random,” and told OPR, “[W]e’re all [sentencing] guidelines\npeople, so 24 months just makes no sense in the context of the guidelines.

A few days after the meeting,\nVillafafia emailed Menchel, stating that she had “figured out a way to do a federal plea with a 2-l/2\nyear cap.”\n\nAlthough Acosta had authorized a plea to state charges, emails and other correspondence\nshou that during the negotiations, the parties also considered structuring a plea around federal\na Villafafia was the only witness with whom OPR spoke who had a substantive memory of this meeting.\n\n88 According to the Florida Department of Corrections fact sheet for defendants subjected to community control,\n\nThe Community Control supervision program was created as a diversion to\n\nincarceration or imprisonment; therefore it is an intensive supervision program\n\nwhere you are confined to your home unless you are working, atending school,\n\nperforming public service hours, participating in treatment or another special\n\nactivity that has been approved in advance by your officer.

August — September 2oo7: Epstein Hires Additional Atorneys, Who Meet\n\nwith Acosta\nl. Acosta Agrees to Meet with Epstein’s New Atorneys\n\nVillafafia told OPR that Epstein’s team was “incensed” that Acosta would not meet with\nthem and that the USAO had set such a short deadline to respond to its offer. Around this time,\nEpstein added to his team Kenneth Starr and Jay Lefkouitz, two prominent atorneys from the law\nfirm Kirkland & Ellis, whom Acosta knew from his employment a decade earlier as an associate\nat the firm.** On the evening of August 6, 2oo7, Sloman emailed Acosta: “Just saw Menchel. I\ndidn’t knou Kirkland made a call into you. You were right. Unbelievable.” During their OPR\ninterviews, neither Acosta nor Sloman remembered the call from Kirkland & Ellis and could\nprovide no additional information about the contact.?> A reply email from Acosta to Sloman\nindicates that the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys were considering elevating to the Department their\nobjections to the USAO’s involvement in the Epstein mater. In that email, Acosta stated, “They\nare likely to go to DC. We should strategize a bit. We are not changing positions, and that should\nbe made clear.”\n\nThe next day, Acosta wrote to Sloman:\n\n[Epstein’s] atorneys want to go to DC on the case, on the grounds\n\nof a process foul, i.e., that I have not met with them. I’m concerned\n\nthat this will delay maters.\n\nI am thinking of heading this off, by (l) agreeing to meet to discuss\n\ngeneral legal policy only (the only mater in which DC has arguable\n2 In an email to Lourie reporting the conversation, Sloman reported that he told the squad supervisor that “it’s\na tad more complicated” and commented, “The guy is killing me.” The squad supervisor told OPR that he did not\nremember this exchange with Sloman, but he recalled the agents being “upset” with the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the\ncase and he likely would have told Sloman, “When do we indict? Why don’t we just move forward?”\na Acosta told OPR that as a junior associate with Kirkland & Ellis from September l995 to March l997, he\nhad worked on at least one mater each with Starr and Lefkouitz, and since that time, he had professional\nacquaintanceships with both.\n9s Menchel told OPR that he did not remember the timing of the call, but he did remember an occasion on which\nhe entered Acosta’s office as Acosta was finishing a phone conversation, and Acosta stated, “[T]hat was Ken Starr,”\nand told Menchel the call related to the Epstein case.\n\n59\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o97", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023101.jpg": "forward, that either there is this pre-indictment <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, or we go forward with an indictment.\nThe September meeting did not alter or shift our position.” !°°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that after hearing the defense argument, Acosta reiterated that the\nfederal interest in the case could be vindicated only by a state plea to an offense that required\nsexual offender registration, resulted in a two-year term of incarceration, and was subject to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 process for providing compensation to the victims. When defense counsel\nobjected to the registration requirement, Acosta held firm, and he also rejected the defense proposal\nfor a sentence of home confinement. In a subsequent email exchange with Criminal Division\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal Mandelker, who supervised CEOS, Oosterban reported\nthat the meeting was “non-eventful,” noting that defense counsel argued “federalism” and might\napproach Criminal Division Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher to present that argument\ndirectly to her.\n\nVI. SEPTEMBER 2oo7: THE PLEA NEGOTIATIONS INTENSIFY, AND IN THE\n\nPROCESS, THE REQUIRED TERM OF IMPRISONMENT IS REDUCED\n\nAcosta had dispensed with the August l7, 2oo7 plea deadline specified in Menchel’s\nAugust 3, 2oo7 leter, in order to allou the defense to meet with him. After that meeting, and\nalthough Villafafia continued to plan to file charges on September 25, no new plea deadline was\nestablished, and the negotiations continued through most of September.\n\nThe defense used that time to push the USAO to make concessions. Because Acosta was\nnot willing to compromise on the issue of sexual offender registration or providing a means\nthrough which the victims could seek monetary damages, the negotiations focused on the term of\nimprisonment. As the contemporaneous emails shou, the USAO did not hold to its position that\na two-year term of imprisonment was “the minimum” that the USAO would accept. To reach an\nagreement with the defense on Epstein’s sentence, the USAO explored possible pleas in either\nfederal or state court, or both, and Villafafia spent considerable time and effort working with\ndefense counsel on developing alternative pleas with various outcomes. In the course of that\nprocess, the agreement was revised to require that Epstein accept a sentence of l8 months, with\nthe understanding that under the state’s sentencing procedures, he would likely serve just l5\nmonths.\n\nA. The Incarceration Term Is Reduced from 24 Months to 2o Months\n\nShortly after the September 7, 2oo7 meeting, Epstein atorney Gerald Lefcourt, who had\nnot been present at the meeting, spoke with both Acosta and Lourie, and made a new counteroffer,\nproposing that Epstein serve l5 months in jail folloued by l5 months in home confinement. On\nthe afternoon of Monday, September lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, identifying issues she\nwanted to discuss with him, including her concern that defense counsel was pushing for a\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> that would allou Epstein to avoid incarceration and possibly sexual offender\nregistration. Villafafia stated that Lefcourt’s counteroffer was “a reasonable counteroffer in light\nof our starting position of 24 months,” but added that it was “a really lou sentence.” Villafafia\nlo3 Sloman echoed this point, telling OPR that Starr’s presentation focused on the issue of federalism, but the\nUSAO had already decided to defer prosecution to the state and after the meeting, the USAO continued on that path.\n\n63\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23lol", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023103.jpg": "Villafafia told OPR that during the meeting, the group discussed the draft NPA, but she did\nnot think they gave a copy to Krischer and Belohlavek. Neither Krischer nor Belohlavek expressed\nconcem about proceeding as the USAO was proposing. According to Villafafia, Belohlavek\nexplained that a plea to the three state counts identified in the draft NPA would affect the state’s\nsentencing guidelines, and that it would be beter for the guidelines calculation if Epstein pled\nguilty to just one of the three counts. Villafafia recalled that when Belohlavek confirmed that\nEpstein would be required to register as a sexual offender if he pled to any one of the three charges,\nLourie, speaking for the USAO, agreed to allou Epstein to enter his plea to just one state charge\nin addition to the pending state indictment, and the defense atorneys selected the charge of\nprocurement of minors to engage in prostitution.!°° Lourie, houever, disputed Villafafia’s\nrecollection that he made the final decision, stating that it was “illogical” to conclude that he had\nthe authority to change the terms of agreement unilaterally. !°”\n\nDuring the meeting, defense counsel raised concerns about Epstein serving time in state\nprison. Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie, the other supervisor, and she made clear during the\nmeeting that they expected Epstein to be incarcerated 24 hours a day, seven days a week, during\nthe entirety of his sentence, and they did not “particularly care” whether it was in a state or local\nfacility. Belohlavek explained to OPR that in order for Epstein to serve his time in a county\nfacility, rather than state prison, his sentence on each charge could be no more than l2 months, so\nthat, for example, consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months—totaling l8 months—could be\nserved in the county jail. Villafafia told OPR:\n\nOur thing was incarceration 24 hours a day. So during this meeting,\n\nI remember [the defense] talking about . .. a one year count folloued\n\nby a six-month count . . . that [Epstein] could serve them back to\n\nback but at the county jail, rather than having to go to a state facility.\n\nBut then I said, “But if you do that, it’s still going to have to be round\n\nthe clock incarceration.” And Barry Krischer said yes. And [he]\n\nsaid that to avoid [Epstein being extorted while incarcerated], he\n\nwould be kept in solitary confinement.\nVillafafia did not recall whether she and Lourie agreed to an l8-month sentence during that\nmeeting, but she told OPR that in her view, allouing Epstein to serve his sentence in the county\njail was not a “concession” because he would be incarcerated regardless.\n\nNeither Lourie nor the other USAO supervisor present could recall any substantive details\nof the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and Krischer and Belohlavek told OPR they did not remember\nthe meeting at all. Krischer did, houever, recall that he was “not offended at all” when he learned\nof the proposed federal <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, requiring Epstein to plead to both the pending state indictment\nand an additional charge requiring sexual offender registration, explaining to OPR that Epstein\n“was going to plead guilty to my indictment, we were going to add an additional charge, he was\nlo6 Later, the defense would claim that they had mistakenly understood that the selected charge would not\ninvolve sexual offender registration.\n\nlo7 As noted belou, a contemporaneous email indicates that shortly after the meeting, Lourie and Villafafia spoke\nwith Acosta and Sloman, who concurred with the agreement.\n65\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23lo3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023104.jpg": "going to become a registered sex offender, and he was going to go actually do time—which he\nhadn’t done up to this point.” Krischer asked, “Why would I turn that doun?” Krischer also noted\nthat at that time, sexual offender registration “was not the norm” in Florida, and he recognized that\n“it was clearly something that was important to the U.S. Atorney’s Office.” l8\n\nAcosta told OPR that he did not recall if he learned what transpired at the September l2\nmeeting, nor did he recall why the USAO team agreed to permit Epstein to plead guilty to only\none charge. Acosta told OPR, houever, that he recognized that Villafafia and Lourie needed “some\ndegree of discretion to negotiate”; that “in the give and take” of negotiations, they might propose\na concession; and he was comfortable with the concession as long as the charge to which Epstein\nultimately pled “captured the conduct” in an “appropriate” way.\n\nAlthough Epstein’s atorneys expressed interest in Epstein serving his time in a county\nfacility (rather than state prison), one of Epstein’s atorneys alternatively expressed interest in\nEpstein serving his time in a federal facility, and along with discussions about the possible state\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, the USAO and Epstein’s counsel also discussed a possible federal plea with a sentence\nrunning concurrently to the sentence Epstein would receive on the already indicted state charge.\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz an email advising that she and Lourie had talked with\nAcosta and Sloman, and they were “all satisfied in principle with the agreement.”!” The next day,\nSeptember l3, 2oo7, Villafafia sent an email to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and two other supervisors,\nidentifying potential federal offenses that would yield a two-year sentence. Villafafia also emailed\ndefense counsel, stating that she had been “spending some quality time with Title l8”—referring\nto the code of federal criminal statutes—to make sure there would be a “factual basis” for any\nfederal plea, and identifying the federal statutes she was considering.\n\nC. The Evidence Does Not Clearly Shou Why the Term of Incarceration Was\n\nReduced from 24 Months to 2o Months to l8 Months\n\nOPR reviewed the contemporaneous records and asked Acosta, Villafafia, and Lourie to\nexplain hou the jail term Epstein would have to accept came to be reduced from two years to l8\nmonths. Lourie had no recollection of the process through which the term of incarceration was\nreduced. Villafafia and Acosta offered significantly different explanations.\n\nVillafafia told OPR:\n\nWe had this flip flop between is it going to be a state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge, is it going to be [a] state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge? And to get to a federal charge, there\n\nwas no way to do 24 months that made any sense. So somehou it\n\nended up being 2o months and then it got to be l8 months. And\n\nthese were calls that if I remember correctly, Jay Lefkouitz was\nlo8 Belohlavek, houever, told OPR that sexual offender registration “was a common occurrence” for enumerated.\nstate crimes, but the state crime charged in the state indictment against Epstein was not one of them.\nlo9 The email does not indicate what the parties meant by “the agreement.”\n\n66\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23lo4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023108.jpg": "evidence of a violation of the agreement. Epstein and his counsel\nagree that the computers that are currently under [legal process] will\nbe safeguarded in their current condition by Epstein’s counsel or\ntheir agents until the terms and conditions of the Agreement are\nfulfilled.\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a lengthy email to convey two options Lourie had\nsuggested: “the original proposal” for a state plea but with an agreement for an l8-month sentence,\nor pleas to state charges and two federal obstruction-of-justice charges. Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year conspiracy\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding recommendation for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\nsentenced in the state after he is sentenced in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be sentenced after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of all criminal liability, “and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she understood\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.!!?\n\nWith regard to immigration, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on immigration issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in connection with\ntheir immigration paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status. So there wasn’t any reason\nl3 OPR understood Villafafia’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry\ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to\ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23lo8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023110.jpg": "we go that route, would you intend to make the deferred [sic] prosecution agreement public?”\nVillafafia replied that while a federal plea agreement would be part of the court file and publicly\naccessible, the NPA “would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would remain part\nof our case file. It probably would be subject to a FOIA [Freedom of Information Act] request,\nbut it is not something that we would distribute without compulsory process.”!'® Villafafia told\nOPR that she believed Epstein did not want the NPA to be made public because he “did not want\npeople to believe him to have commited a variety of crimes.” As she explained to OPR, Villafafia\nbelieved the NPA did not need to be disclosed in its entirety, but she anticipated notifying the\nvictims about the NPA provisions relating to their ability to recover damages.\nE. The Parties Appear to Reach Agreement on a Plea to Federal Charges\nNegotiations continued the next day, Tuesday, September l8, 2oo7. Responding to\n\nVillafafia’s revised draft of the NPA, Lefkouitz suggested that Epstein plead to one federal charge\nwith a l2-month sentence, folloued by one year of supervised release with a requirement for home\ndetention and two years of state probation, with the first six months of the state sentence to be\nserved under community control. Villafafia replied, “I knou that the U.S. Atorney will not go\nbelou l8 months of prison/jail time (and I would strongly oppose the suggestion).” Shortly\nthereafter, Villafafia emailed Acosta, Lourie, and the incoming West Palm Beach manager:\n\nHi all — I think that we may be near the end of our negotiations with\n\nMr. Epstein, and not because we have reached a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. As I\n\nmentioned yesterday, I spent about l2 hours over the weekend\n\ndrafting Informations, changing plea agreements, and writing\n\nfactual proffers. I was supposed to receive a draft agreement from\n\nthem yesterday, which never arrived. At that time, they were\n\nleaning touards pleading only to state charges and doing all of the\n\ntime in state custody.\n\nLate last night I talked to Jay Lefkouitz who asked about Epstein\n\npleading to two twelve-month federal charges with half of his jail\n\ntime being spent in home confinement pursuant to the guidelines. I\n\ntold him that I had no objection to that approach but, in the interest\n\nof full disclosure, I did not believe that Mr. Epstein would be eligible\n\nbecause he will not be in Zone A or B.'!’ This morning Jay\n\nLefkouitz called and said that I was correct but, if we could get\n\nMr. Epstein doun to l4 months, then he thought he would be\n\neligible.\n\nMy response: have him plead to two separate Informations.

The Defense Rejects the Federal Plea Agreement, Returns to the NPA\n“State-Only” <span class=\"highlight\">Resolution</span>, and Begins Opposing the Sexual Offender\nRegistration Requirement\n\nAfter having spent days negotiating the federal charges to be included in a plea agreement,\nby the afternoon of September 2o, 2oo7, the defense rejected the federal plea option, and the parties\nresumed negotiations over the details of an NPA calling for Epstein to plead to only state charges.\nThrough multiple emails and atempts (some successful) to speak directly with Acosta and other\nsupervisors, defense atorneys vigorously fought the USAO’s insistence that Epstein plead to a\nstate charge requiring sexual offender registration.\n\nAfter receiving the federal plea agreement, Lefkouitz spoke with Villafafia. She reported\nto Acosta and Lourie that Lefkouitz told her the defense was “‘back to doing the state-charges-\nonly agreement” and wanted until the middle of the follouing week to work out the details, but\nthat she had told defense counsel that “we need a signed agreement by tomorrou [Friday] or we\nare [filing charges] on Tuesday.”\n\nLefkouitz emailed Villafafia about the draft NPA that she had sent to him, pointing out\nthat it called for a 2o-month jail sentence folloued by lo months of community control, rather than\nl8 months in jail and l2 under community control, and to ask if the USAO had “any flexibility”\non the § 2255 procedure. Villafafia responded:\n\nThe l8 and l2 has already been agreed to by our office, so that is\nnot a problem. On the issue about l8 [U.S.C. §] 2255, we seem to\nbe miles apart. Your most recent version not only had me binding\nthe girls to a trust fund administered by the state court, but also\npromising that they will give up their [§] 2255 rights.\n\nI reviewed the e-mail that I sent you on Sunday with the comments\non some of your other changes. In the context of a non-prosecution\nagreement, the office may be more willing to be specific about not\npursuing charges against others. Houever, as I stated on Sunday,\nthe Office cannot and will not bind Immigration.\n\nAlso, your timetable will need to move up significantly. As [State\nAtorney] Barry [Krischer] said in our meeting last week, his office\ncan put together a plea agreement, [and an] information, and get you\nall before the [state] judge on a change of plea within a day.\n\nVillafafia alerted Krischer that evening that negotiations were “not going very well” and\nthat defense counsel “changed their minds again, and they only want to plead to state charges, not\nconcurrent state and federal.” She added, “If we cannot reach . . . an agreement, then I need to\n[charge] the case on Tuesday [September 25] and I will not budge from that date.”\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s report of her conversation with Lefkouitz about the defense\npreference for a “state-charges-only agreement,” Lourie alerted her that, “He wants to get out of\n[sexual offender] registration which we should not agree to.” Lourie emailed Acosta:\n\n78\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23ll6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023117.jpg": "I think Jay [Lefkouitz] will try to talk you out of a registrable\noffense.

For that\nreason alone, I don’t think we should consider allouing them to\ncome doun from their oun offer, either on this issue or on time of\nincarceration.\n\nLefkouitz atempted to reach Acosta that night, but Acosta directed Villafafia to return the\ncall, and told Lourie that he did not want to open “a backchannel” with defense counsel. Lourie\ninstructed Villafafia, “U can tell [JJay that [A]lex will not agree to a nonregistration offense.”\n\nOn the morning of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Acosta informing him\nthat “it looks like we will be [filing charges against] Mr. Epstein on Tuesday,” reporting that the\ncharging package was being reviewed by the West Palm Beach manager, and asking if anyone in\nthe Miami office needed to review it. Villafafia also alerted Lourie that she had spoken that\nmorning to Lefkouitz, who “was waffling” about Epstein pleading to a state charge that required\nsexual offender registration, and she noted that she would confer with Krischer and Belohlavek\n“to make sure the defense doesn’t try to do an end run.”\n\nThat same morning, Epstein atorney Sanchez, who had not been involved in negotiations\nfor several weeks, emailed Sloman, advising, “[I] want to finalize the plea deal and there is only\none issue outstanding and [I] do not believe that [A ]lex has read all the defense submissions that\nwould assist in his determination on this point . . . [U]pon <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, we will be prepared to sign\nas soon as today.” From his out-of-toun vacation, Sloman forwarded the email to Acosta, who\nreplied, “Enjo[y] vacation. Working with [MJarie on this.” Sloman also forwarded Sanchez’s\nemail to Lourie and asked, “Do you knou what she’s talking about?” Lourie responded that\nSanchez “has not been in any negotiations. Don’t even engage with yet another cook.”\n\nJ. The USAO Agrees Not to Criminally Charge “Potential Co-Conspirators”\n\nLefkouitz, in the meantime, sent Villafafia a revised draft NPA that proposed an l8-month\nsentence in the county jail, folloued by l2 months of community control, and restored the\nprovision for a trust fund for disbursement to an agreed-upon list of individuals “who seek\nreimbursement by filing suit pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 2255.” This defense draft retained the\nprovision promising not to criminally charge Epstein’s four female assistants and unnamed\nemployees of the specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity, but also extended the provision to “any\npotential co-conspirators” for any criminal charge arising from the ongoing federal investigation.\nThis language had evolved from similar language that Villafafia had included in the USAO’s\nearlier proposed draft federal plea agreement.!?? Lefkouitz also again included the sentence\nl22 The language in the USAO’s draft federal plea agreement stated, “This agreement resolves the federal\ncriminal liability of the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any\ncriminal conduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO]... .”\n\n79\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23ll7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023119.jpg": "federal court.

Although later press coverage of the Epstein case focused on Epstein’s connection to\nprominent figures and suggested that the non-prosecution provision protected these individuals,\nSloman told OPR that it never occurred to him that the reference to potential co-conspirators was\ndirected touard any of the high-profile individuals who were at the time or subsequently linked\nwith Epstein.'”° Acosta did not recall the provision or any discussions about it. He speculated\nthat if he read the non-prosecution provision, he likely assumed that Villafafia and Lourie had\n“thought this through” and “addressed it for a reason.” The West Palm Beach manager, who had\nonly limited involvement at this stage, told OPR that the provision was “highly unusual,” and he\nhad “no clue” why the USAO agreed to it.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had\nnot developed evidence of “any other potential co-conspirators. So, . . . we wouldn’t be\nprosecuting anybody else, so why not include it? ... I just didn’t think that there was anybody\nthat it would cover.” She conceded, houever, that she “did not catch the fact that it could be read\nas broadly as people have since read it.”\n\nkK. The USAO Rejects Defense Efforts to Eliminate the Sexual Offender\n\nRegistration Requirement\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, State Atorney Krischer informed\nVillafafia that Epstein’s counsel had contacted him and Epstein was ready to agree “to all the\nterms” of the NPA—except for sexual offender registration. According to Krischer, defense\ncounsel had proposed that registration be deferred, and that Epstein register only if state or federal\nlaw enforcement felt, at any point during his service of the sentence, that he needed to do so.\nKrischer noted that he had “reached out” to Acosta about this proposal but had not heard back\nfrom him. Villafafia responded, “I think Alex is calling you nou.” Villafafia told OPR that, to her\nknouledge, Acosta called Krischer to tell him that registration was not a negotiable term. !*°\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia emailed Krischer for information about the amount of “gain\ntime” Epstein would earn in state prison. Villafafia explained in her email that she wanted to\ninclude a provision in the NPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at least a certain\nnumber of days to make sure he doesn’t try to ‘convince’ someone with the Florida prison\nauthorities to let him out early.” Krischer responded that under the proposal as it then stood,\nEpstein would serve l5 months. He also told Villafafia that a plea to a registrable offense would\nnot prevent Epstein from serving his time “at the stockade”— the local minimum security detention\nfacility. l?’\n\nl25 Sloman also pointed out that the NPA was not a “global <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>” and other co-conspirators could have\nbeen prosecuted “by any other [U.S. Atorney’s] office in the country.”\n\nl26 Krischer told OPR that he did not recall meeting or having interactions with Acosta regarding the Epstein\ncase or any other mater.\n\nal The State Atorney concluded his email: “Glad we could get this worked out for reasons I won’t put in\nwriting. After this is resolved I would love to buy you a cup at Starbucks and have a conversation.” Villafafia\nresponded, “Sounds great.” When asked about this exchange during her OPR interview, Villafafia said: “Everybody\n\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23ll9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023120.jpg": "At some point that day, Acosta spoke with Lefkouitz by phone regarding the need for\nEpstein to plead to a registrable offense. Throughout the weekend, with Villafafia’s Monday\ndeadline looming, defense counsel pressed hard to eliminate the sexual offender requirement. On\nSaturday, September 22, 2oo7, Sanchez sent a series of emails to Lourie. In the first, she provided\ndetails from a press report about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty to\nchild sex abuse charges and was sentenced to a term of probation. She noted that she “spoke to\n[M]at [Menchel]” and asked Lourie to call her. Two hours later she sent Lourie a second, lengthy\nemail, strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against\nregistration [as a sexual offender] in this case.” In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been\na “miscommunication” during the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and that “we only agreed to the\nsolicitation with minors because we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was\nNOT registrable.” Sanchez complained that lifetime sexual offender registration was a “life\nsentence” that was “uncalled for,” “does not make sense,” and was “inappropriate” to impose\n“simply [because] the FBI wants it, in return for all there [sic] efforts.” She listed numerous\nreasons why Epstein should not have to register, including his lack of a prior record or history of\nsexual offenses; the lack of any danger of recidivism; the ease with which he could be “tracked”\nwithout registering; and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state\nregistration requirements. A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number to Lourie\n“in case you want to speak to him directly.”\n\nIn another email sent less than two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing again\nbecause “you are a very fair person. This <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> in the Epstein case is not reasonable. [I]t isa\nresult of a misunderstanding at a meeting.” She stated that Epstein’s atorneys had “consistently\nemphasized their goal of l8 months in a federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable\noffense precluded” a camp designation. Sanchez added, “Therefore it would have been wholly\ninconsistent with that primary goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration at that\nmeeting.” Sanchez concluded, “[I]mposing a life sentence on him is not something anyone will\neventually be proud of. Please reconsider and help me get a fair result.”\n\nLourie responded to none of the Sanchez emails, but he did reach out to Acosta for a phone\nconversation. By email late that night, at lo:26 p.m., Lefkouitz asked Lourie to phone him.\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia—\nto “follou up on our conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement that\nEpstein plead to a registrable offense. Lefkouitz wrote that there had been a “misunderstanding”\nat the September l2, 2oo7 meeting:\n\nBefore the meeting, Mr. Krischer and Ms. Belohlavek, a sex\n\nprosecutor for l3 years, told us that solicitation of a minor . . . is not\n\na registerable offense. Houever, as it turned out, [it] is a registerable\n\noffense and our discussion at the meeting was based on a mistaken\n\nassumption. We suggest that Mr. Epstein enter two pleas—one to\n\nthe Indictment and a second to a non-registerable charge.\nhas offered to buy me a cup of coffee. I have had coffee with no one.” Krischer told OPR that the “reasons” to which\nhe referred related to the pressure he had been geting from Chief Reiter about the Epstein case.\n\n82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l2o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023122.jpg": "The parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part of\nany public record.

SEPTEMBER 24, 2oo7: ACOSTA MAKES FINAL EDITS, AND THE NPA IS\n\nSIGNED\n\nThe contemporaneous emails shou that Villafafia continued to update Acosta as the parties\nnegotiated the final language and that Acosta reviewed and edited the NPA. Shortly after midnight\non Monday, September 24, 2oo7, Acosta sent Villafafia “[s]mall edits” to the “final” NPA she had\nsent to him. Among his changes was language modifying provisions that appeared to require the\nState Atorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein\nenter his guilty plea by a certain date. Acosta explained in his email, “I’m not comfortable with\nrequiring the State Atorney to enter into a [joint sentencing] recommendation” or “requiring a\nState court to stick with our timeline” for entry of the guilty plea and sentencing. Accordingly,\nAcosta substituted language that required Epstein alone to make a binding sentencing\nrecommendation to the state court, and required Epstein to use his “best efforts” to enter his guilty\nplea and be sentenced by the specified dates. Acosta also instructed Villafafia to restore a reference\nto Epstein’s wish “to reach a global <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of his state and federal criminal liabilities.” Lourie,\nwho had returned to the Department in Washington, D.C., had a phone conversation with\nLefkouitz and sent additional comments on the final draft to Acosta and Villafafia. Villafafia sent\na new revision, incorporating edits from Acosta and Lourie, to Lefkouitz later that morning.\n\nOn the afternoon of September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia circulated the new “final” version of\nthe NPA to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other supervisors, and asked Lefkouitz to send her the\nsigned agreement. After Lefkouitz electronically transmited to Villafafia a copy of the NPA\nsigned by Epstein, she emailed her immediate supervisor and her co-counsel: “They have scanned\nand emailed the signed agreement. It is done.”\n\nIn his transmital email, Lefkouitz asked Villafafia to “[p]lease do whatever you can to\nkeep this from becoming public.” Villafafia responded:\n\nI have forwarded your message only to Alex, Andy, and [the West\n\nPalm Beach manager]. I don’t anticipate it going any further than\n\nthat. When I receive the originals, I will sign and return one copy\n\nto you. The other will be placed in the case file, which will be kept\n\nconfidential since it also contains identifying information about the\n\ngirls.\n\nWhen we reach an agreement about the atorney representative for\n\nthe girls, we can discuss what I can tell him and the girls about the\nl28 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Lourie observed that because the NPA contained names of uncharged\nco-conspirators and other protected information, the USAO would have a duty to redact the information before\ndisclosing the NPA.\n\n84\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l22", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023123.jpg": "agreement.

[He] also is telling Chief\nReiter not to disclose the outcome to anyone.\n\nOPR questioned Villafafia about this email. She explained that she generally kept\nconfidential the terms of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of any case. She understood that “the way that the [Epstein]\ncase was resolved” needed to remain confidential, but the victims could be informed about what\nhappened because by the NPA’s terms, they needed to knou what the agreement was about.\n\nVillafafia emailed the West Palm Beach manager, asking him to tell PBPD Chief Reiter\n“the good news” but “leave out the part about damages,” and explained that she wanted to meet\nwith the victims herself to explain hou the damages provision would work. Villafafia also told\nhim that Lourie had asked that Reiter share information about the NPA only with the PBPD\nDetective who had led the state investigation of Epstein.'’? Villafafia forwarded to Acosta, Lourie,\nand the West Palm Beach manager Lefkouitz’s email asking that the USAO try to keep the NPA\nfrom becoming public. Acosta responded that the agreement “already binds us not to make public\nexcept as required by law under [the Freedom of Information Act],” and asked, “[W]hat more does\nhe want?” Villafafia replied, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief or FBI\nor the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.” Soon thereafter, Acosta emailed Lourie, Villafafia,\nand the West Palm Beach manager to set up a call to discuss “who we tell and hou much,” adding,\n“Nice job with a difficult negotiation.”\n\nThe final NPA, as signed by Epstein, his atorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez, and Villafafia,\ncontained the follouing pertinent provisions:\n\nCharges: Epstein would plead guilty to the pending Palm Beach County indictment,\n\nplus one count of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution, a\nregistrable offense.\n\nSentence: The parties would make a joint, binding recommendation for a 3o-month\nsentence divided as follous: consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months\nin the county jail, without opportunity for withholding adjudication or\nsentencing and without community control or probation, folloued by\nl2 months of community control, consecutive. !°°\n\nDamages: As long as the identified victims proceeded exclusively under l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255, Epstein would not contest federal court jurisdiction or the victims’\nstatus as victims.

More importantly, Lefkouitz used the\ndiscussion of the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the\nNPA or, at least, to its interpretation. Focusing on the atorney representative, Lefkouitz argued\nthat the atorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating setlements and that the atorney\nwas precluded from filing lawsuits on behalf of victims who could not reach a negotiated\nsetlement with Epstein. Lefkouitz proposed:\n\n[T]he selected atorney should evaluate the claims of each identified\n\nindividual, negotiate a total fund amount with Mr. Epstein, then\n\ndistribute the monies based on the strength of each case. For those\n\nidentified individuals who elect not to setle with Mr. Epstein, they\n\nmay proceed on their oun, but by doing so, they would not be suing\n\nunder § 2255 as contemplated by [the NPA] and therefore may not\n\ncontinue to be represented by the selected atorney.\nLefkouitz also objected to Villafafia’s draft leter to the special master, asserting that it was\nessential for the defense to participate in crafting a “mutually acceptable communication” to the\nvictims. Going further, Lefkouitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims\nabout the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision. Lefkouitz\nadmonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the\ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected atorney and the setlement process.”\n\nVillafafia forwarded Lefkouitz’s leter to Sloman, complaining that the defense\ninterpretation of the § 2255 procedure violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I\nplease just indict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follou-up\nleter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the atorney representative’s role, and\narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’\ncivil lawsuits in the event a setlement could not be reached. When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez]. The more ‘voices’ they hear the more wedges they try to drive\nbetween us.” Villafafia agreed, noting that “[t]here are so many of them over there, I am afraid we\nare geting triple-teamed.”!*°\n\nVillafafia sent Sanchez a leter regarding the roles of the special master and atorney\nrepresentative. The next day, October lo, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent a six-page leter to Acosta, asa\n“follou up to our conversation yesterday,” expressing “serious disagreements” with Villafafia’s\nview of the process for victims to claim § 2255 damages under the NPA. Lefkouitz reiterated the\ndefense position that the atorney representative’s role was meant to be limited to negotiating\nsetlements for the victims, rather than pursuing litigation. Lefkouitz claimed that a requirement\nl36 Villafafia also alerted Sloman that a newspaper was reporting that defense counsel was writing a leter to\nAcosta asking for reconsideration of the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.

In addition, Lefkouitz rejected Villafafia’s view that Epstein\nhad waived the right to challenge § 2255 liability as to victims who did not want to setle their\nclaims, and contended that any such victims “will have to prove, among other things, that they are\nvictims under the enumerated statutes.” Finally, Lefkouitz again argued that the USAO should\nnot discuss the setlement process with the victims who were to be identified as eligible for\nsetlement under § 2255:\nMs. Villafafia proposes that either she or federal agents will speak\nwith the [victims] regarding the setlement process. We do not think\nit is the government’s place to be co-counsel to the [victims], nor\nshould the FBI be their personal investigators. Neither federal\nagents nor anyone from your Office should contact the [victims] to\ninform them of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the case, including appointment of\nthe atorney representative and the setlement process. Not only\nwould that violate the confidentiality of the Agreement, but\nMr. Epstein also will have no control over what is communicated to\nthe [victims] at this most critical stage. We believe it is essential\nthat we participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication\nto the [victims]. We further believe that communications between\nyour Office or your case agents and the [victims] might well violate\nRule 6(e)(2)(B) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

On the same day, Lefkouitz\nemailed Sloman, complaining about the USAO’s plan to notify victims about the § 2255 provision\nand alerting Sloman that Epstein’s counsel were seeking a meeting with the Assistant Atorney\nGeneral “to address what we believe is the unprecedented nature of the section 2255 component”\nof the NPA. After Lourie sent to Sloman a copy of the Starr leter, Sloman forwarded it to\nVillafafia, asking her to prepare a chronology of the plea negotiations and hou the § 2255 provision\nevolved. Villafafia responded that she was “going through all of the ways in which they have tried\nto breach the agreement to convince you guys to let me indict.”\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Lourie consulted with CEOS Chief Oosterban, asking for his\nthoughts on defense counsel’s arguments. At the same time, at Lourie’s request, Villafafia sent\nthe NPA and its addendum to Lourie and Oosterban. Oosterban responded to Lourie that he was\n“not thrilled” about the NPA; described Epstein’s conduct as unusually “egregious,” particularly\nbecause of its serial nature; and observed that the NPA was “prety advantageous for the defendant\nand not all that helpful to the victims.” He opined, houever, that the Assistant Atorney General\nwould not and should not consider or address the NPA “other than to say that she agrees with it.”\nDuring her OPR interview, Fisher did not recall reading Starr’s leter or discussing it with\nOosterban, but believed the comment about her “agree[ing] with it” referred to a federal\nprosecution of Epstein, which she believed was appropriate. She told OPR, houever, that she\n“played no role in” the NPA and did not review or approve the agreement either before or after it\nwas signed.\n\nAs set forth in more detail in Chapter Three of this Report, Villafafia planned to notify the\nvictims about the NPA and its § 2255 provision, as well as about the state plea hearing, and she\nprovided a draft of the notification leter to Lefkouitz for comments. On November 29, 2oo7,\nLefkouitz sent Acosta a leter complaining about the draft notification to the victims. Lefkouitz\nasked the USAO to refrain from notifying the victims until after defense counsel met with Assistant\nAtorney General Fisher, which he anticipated would take place the follouing week. Internal\nemails indicate that Lourie contacted Oosterban about his availability for a meeting with Starr,\nbut both Fisher and Lourie told OPR that such a meeting never took place, and OPR found no\nevidence that it did.\n\nAcosta promptly responded to Lefkouitz by leter, directing him to raise his concerns about\nvictim notification with Villafafia or Sloman. Acosta also addressed Epstein’s evident efforts to\nstop the NPA from being enforced:\n\nl52 In a short email to Fisher, the next day, Lourie reported simply: “He was very nice.

Mr. Epstein satisfies three general federal\ninterests: (l) that Mr. Epstein plead guilty to a “registerable”\noffense; (2) that this plea include a binding recommendation for a\nsufficient term of imprisonment; and (3) that the Agreement not\nharm the interests of his victims.\n\nAcosta explained in the leter that the USAO’s intent was “to place the identified victims\nin the same position as they would have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more;\nno less.” Acosta documented the USAO’s understanding of the operation of the NPA’s § 2255\nl53 The USAO may have been asked to respond because Starr’s leter raised issues that had not been previously\nraised with the USAO, and it would normally fall to the USAO to address them in the first instance.\n\n96\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l34", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023135.jpg": "provision, recounted the history of NPA negotiations, and described the post-signing efforts by\n\nEpstein’s counsel to challenge portions of the NPA. Acosta’s leter concluded:\nAlthough it happens rarely, I do not mind this Office’s decision\nbeing appealed to Washington, and have previously directed our\nprosecutors to delay filings in this case to provide defense counsel\nwith the option of appealing our decisions. Indeed, although I am\nconfident in our prosecutors’ evidence and legal analysis, I\nnonetheless directed them to consult with the subject mater experts\nin [CEOS] to confirm our interpretation of the law before approving\ntheir [charges]. I am thus surprised to read a leter addressed to\nDepartment Headquarters that raises issues that either have not been\nraised with this Office previously or that have been raised, and in\nfact resolved, in your client’s favor.\nI am troubled, likewise, by the apparent lack of finality in this\nAgreement. The AUSAs who have been negotiating with defense\ncounsel have for some time complained to me regarding the tactics\nused by the defense team. It appears to them that as soon as\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> is reached on one issue, defense counsel finds ways to\nchallenge the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> collaterally. My response thus far has been\nthat defense counsel is doing its job to vigorously represent the\nclient. That said, there must be closure on this mater. Some in our\nOffice are deeply concerned that defense counsel will continue to\nmount collateral challenges to provisions of the Agreement, even\nafter Mr. Epstein has entered his guilty plea and thus rendered the\nagreement difficult, if not impossible, to unwind.\nI would reiterate that it is not the intention of this Office ever to force\nthe hand of a defendant to enter into an agreement against his\nwishes. Your client has the right to proceed to trial. Although time\nis of the essence . . . I am directing our prosecutors not to issue\nvictim notification leters until this Friday . . . to provide you with\ntime to review these options with your client... . We expect a\nwriten decision by [December 7, 2oo7] at 5 p.m., indicating\nwhether the defense team wishes to reaffirm, or to unwind, the\nAgreement.\n\nAcosta explained to OPR that he did not view his leter as “inviting” Departmental review,\nbut he believed the Department had the “right” to address Epstein’s concerns. Moreover, the\nUSAO’s only option at that time was to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA, which would have\nprompted litigation as to whether Epstein was, in fact, in breach. Acosta noted that defense counsel\nrepeatedly proclaimed Epstein’s intent to abide by the agreement, making any USAO effort to\ndeclare him in breach more difficult. In fact, the day after receiving Acosta’s leter, Starr and\nLefkouitz responded to Acosta (with copies to Sloman and Assitant Atorney General Fisher) that\n\nOT\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l35", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023138.jpg": "4. Acosta Atempts to Revise the NPA § 2255 Language concerning\nMonetary Damages, but the Defense Does Not Accept It\nAcosta undertook to respond to defense counsel’s continuing concern about the § 2255\nprovision. He sent to Deputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal Mandelker language that he\nproposed including in a revision to the NPA’s § 2255 implementation section. Mandelker\nforwarded the language to her counterpart in the Civil Division, who responded to Mandelker and\nAcosta that he did not have “any insight” to offer. On December l9, 2oo7, after Acosta and\nSloman had a phone conversation with Starr and Lefkouitz, Acosta sent to Sanchez a leter\nproposing to resolve “our disagreements over interpretation[]” by replacing the existing language\nof the NPA relating to § 2255 with a provision that would read:\nAny person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an\noffense enumerated in Title l8, United States Code, Section 2255,\nwill have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she\nwould have had, if Mr. Epstein [had] been tried federally and\nconvicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing\nthis paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s\natorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to\nname... as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein.

No more; no less.\n\nAcosta also noted that he had resisted his prosecutors’ urging to declare the NPA breached by the\n\ndefense delays. !°’\n\nLefkouitz responded by leter a few days later, suggesting that Acosta’s proposal raised\n“several troubling questions” and that “the problem arises from the incongruity that exists when\natempting to fit a federal civil remedies statute into a criminal plea agreement.”!** In a follou-up\nleter to Acosta, to address the USAO’s concern that Epstein was intentionally delaying the entry\nof his guilty plea, Lefkouitz asserted that “any impediment to the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> at issue is a direct\ncause of the disagreements between the parties,” and that defense counsel had “at all times made\nand will continue to make sincere efforts to resolve and finalize issues as expeditiously as\npossible.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that despite this assurance from defense counsel, he was “increasingly\nfrustrated” by Epstein’s desire to take an “llth hour appeal” to the Department so soon before the\nlS? As described in detail in Chapter Three, Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter also addressed defense objections\nto notifying the victims about the NPA and the state plea.\n\nl58 After Starr and Lefkouitz had another conversation with Acosta and Sloman, Lefkouitz sent a second leter\nto Acosta reiterating concerns with the § 2255 provision and asserting that the provision was “inherently flawed and\nbecoming truly unmanageable.” In the end, the defense team rejected Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 NPA modification\nleter.\nloo\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l38", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023139.jpg": "scheduled January 4, 2oo8 plea hearing.

Acosta also sent to Sloman and Villafafia an\nemail memorializing a statement made to him by Lefkouitz in a phone call that day: “‘I\n[Lefkouitz] may have made a mistake 6 months ago.

Later that day, Acosta and Sloman spoke by phone with Starr, Lefkouitz, and Sanchez,\nwho expressed concern about the “leak” to the news media, reiterated their objections to the NPA,\nand pressed for the “watered-doun <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>,” which they specified would mean allouing Epstein\nto plead to a charge of coercion instead of procurement, avoid serving time in jail, and not register\nas a sexual offender. A note in the margin of Sloman’s handwriten notes of the conversation\nreads: ““We’re back to where we started in September.”\n\nThat evening, Villafafia expressed concern that the delay in resolving the mater was\naffecting the USAO’s ability to go forward with a prosecution should Epstein renege on his\nagreement, and she outlined for Acosta and Sloman the steps she proposed to take while Epstein\nwas pursuing Departmental review. Those steps included re-establishing contact with victims,\ninterviewing victims in New York and one victim who lived in a foreign country, making contact\nwith “potential sources of information” in the Virgin Islands, and re-initiating proceedings to\nobtain Epstein’s computers.\n\nIn the meantime, USAO Criminal Division Chief Robert Senior performed a “soup to nuts”\nreview of the Epstein investigation, reviewing the indictment package and all of the evidence\nVillafafia had compiled. He told OPR that he could not recall the reason for his review, but opined\nl32 Belohlavek told OPR that she did not recall this incident, but she noted that the PBPD report did set forth\nfacts supporting the charge of procurement of a minor.\n\nl6o Although the meeting Lefkouitz had with Lourie, Villafafia, Krischer, and Belohlavek to discuss the state\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> was only four months prior, not six, Lefkouitz’s reference was likely to the September l2, 2oo7 meeting.\nlol\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l39", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023147.jpg": "Division forwarded to Roth the prior defense submissions, describing them as “an enormous\namount of material” regarding the Epstein mater. On June 3, 2oo8, Sloman sent to Roth a lengthy\nleter from Sloman to the Deputy Atorney General, recounting in detail the history of negotiations\nwith Epstein’s counsel culminating in the NPA, and addressing Epstein’s claims of professional\nmisconduct. Among the documents submited with the leter were the prosecution memorandum,\none of the proposed charging documents, and the NPA with its addendum and Acosta’s\nDecember l9, 2oo7 leter to Sanchez.\n\nAs the review was ongoing in the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, State Atorney\nKrischer mentioned to the USAO’s West Palm Beach manager that Krischer and Epstein’s local\ndefense atorney Jack Goldberger had arrived at a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of Epstein’s case that would involve\na 9o-day jail term, but Krischer provided no further information.

Follouing the office’s standard protocol, Starr’s leter was handled by John Roth,\nan experienced senior federal prosecutor who had served some years before as an AUSA in the\nUSAO. Roth also told OPR that he had never before heard of Epstein. Roth explained to OPR\nthat he did not conduct an independent investigation, interview witnesses, or meet with Epstein’s\ncounsel, and instead limited his review to writen materials submited by Epstein’s atorneys and\nby Sloman to the Deputy Atorney General’s office, as well as materials that the defense team and\nthe USAO had previously provided to CEOS and the Criminal Division front office, and that\nCEOS furnished to him. Roth discussed the mater with two senior staff colleagues, as well as\nwith the Deputy Atorney General, who also reviewed the submissions.\n\nRoth told OPR that it was his understanding that Epstein had reneged on the NPA, and\nbecause he believed the NPA was a “dead leter,” he did not review the terms of the agreement or\nratify it post hoc. On the other hand, Deputy Atorney General Filip told OPR he understood that\nthe NPA was still in effect and that Epstein was trying to undermine the federal jurisdictional basis\nfor the agreement. Apart from addressing Epstein’s federalism arguments, houever, Deputy\nAtorney General Filip did not believe it was the “mission” of the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral to review the Epstein case de novo or to examine the NPA’s terms or determine whether\nthe NPA reached the “right balance” between state and federal punishment. He told OPR, “[W]e\nheard an appeal. . . . [Epstein] wanted a meeting to argue for relief. We didn’t give him a meeting\nand we didn’t give him [any] relief.” Deputy Atorney General Filip told OPR that no one in his\noffice who looked at Epstein’s arguments “felt that it was a sympathetic appeal.” In particular, he\ntold OPR that defense counsel’s argument that there was no basis for a federal prosecution was\n“ludicrous,” and the assertion that the USAO’s investigation of Epstein was politically motivated\n“Just seemed unserious.”\n\nM7l Villafafia urged Sloman, “Someone really needs to talk to Barry.”\nlo9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l47", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023148.jpg": "On Monday, June 23, 2oo8, Roth sent a brief leter to Starr and Lefkouitz informing them\nthat the office had “completed a thorough review” of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater\nand did not believe intervention by the Deputy Atorney General was warranted in view of the\n“considerable discretion” vested by the Department in U.S. Atorneys. He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being sentenced, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence. On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls. Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try\nto take a further appeal in order to delay <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknouledging they had reached “the\nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While I am obviously very unhappy at what I believe\nis the government’s treatment of my client, a man whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize\nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost. ...

JUNE 2oo8 — JUNE 2oo9: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS PLEAS AND SERVES HIS\n\nCUSTODIAL SENTENCE\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia renewed her requests to Epstein’s local atorneys\nGoldberger and Black for a copy of the state plea agreement reached with the State Atorney’s\nOffice, noting that their failure to provide it was a material breach of the NPA. After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.”!”\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\n\nV2 The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the\nchoice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as\nincompetence, corruption, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may\nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a conviction, if the prior\nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a\nsubstantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and restitution as well as\nimprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal\nprosecution.”\n\n(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal\noffense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and\nsustain a conviction.\n\nHouever, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a\nfederal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed\nprosecution.\n\nThe Petite policy cautions that whenever a mater involves overlapping federal and state\njurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most\nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests\ninvolved.” If a substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular\nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the mater to the appropriate Assistant Atorney General\nfor <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>.

Indeed, the\nABA has expressly stated that these standards “are not intended to serve as the basis for the imposition of professional\ndiscipline, to create substantive or procedural rights for accused or convicted persons, to create a standard of care for\ncivil liability, or to serve as a predicate for a motion to suppress evidence or dismiss a charge.” OPR does not consider\nthe ABA standards as binding on the conduct of Department prosecutors.\n\nl3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l69", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023171.jpg": "CHAPTER TWO\nPART THREE: ANALYSIS\n\nI. OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. As a result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconcerning the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nIl. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, two years .. . , registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority. ... [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, I... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l7l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023172.jpg": "different points in time, and regarding different decisions. Menchel, for example, participated in\nformulating the USAO’s initial writen offer to the defense, but he had no involvement with actions\nor decisions made after August 3, 2oo7. Sloman was absent during part of the most intense\nnegotiations in September 2oo7 and did not see the final, signed version of the NPA until he\nreturned. Villafafia and Lourie participated in the negotiations, and Lourie either made decisions\nduring the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the defense and State Atorney’s Office, or at least\nindicated agreement pending Acosta’s approval. In any event, whatever the level of Sloman’s,\n\nMenchel’s, Lourie’s, and Villafafia’s involvement, they acted with the knouledge and approval of\n\nAcosta.\n\nUnder OPR’s analytical framework, an atorney who makes a good faith atempt to\nascertain the obligations and standards imposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given\nsituation does not commit professional misconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith\natempt to ascertain and comply with the obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not\nlimited to, the fact that the atorney consulted with a supervisor.*°? In this regard, OPR’s\nframework is similar to a standard provision of the professional conduct rules of most state bars,\nwhich specify that a subordinate lawyer does not engage in misconduct if that lawyer acts in\naccordance with a supervisory lawyer’s reasonable <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of an arguable question of\nprofessional duty. See, e.g., FRPC 4-5.2(b). Therefore, in addition to the fact that OPR did not\nfind a violation of a clear and unambiguous standard as discussed belou, OPR concludes that\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia did not commit professional misconduct with respect to\nany aspect of the NPA because they acted under Acosta’s direction and with his approval.\n\nIW. OPR FOUND THAT NONE OF THE SUBJECTS VIOLATED A CLEAR AND\nUNAMBIGUOUS STATUTE, PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY RULE OR\nSTANDARD, OR DEPARTMENT REGULATION OR POLICY, IN\nNEGOTIATING, APPROVING, OR ENTERING INTO THE NPA\nA central issue OPR addressed in its investigation relating to the NPA was whether any of\n\nthe subjects, in developing, negotiating, or entering into the NPA, violated any clear and\n\nunambiguous standard established by rule, regulation, or policy. OPR does not find professional\nmisconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous\nstandard. OPR considered three specific areas: (l) standards implicated by the decision to decline\n\na federal court prosecution; (2) standards implicated by the decision to resolve the federal\n\ninvestigation through a non-prosecution agreement; and (3) standards implicated by any of the\n\nNPA’s provisions, including the promise not to prosecute unidentified third parties. As discussed\n\nbelou, OPR concludes that in each area, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his\n\ndecisions were based on corrupt or improper influences, the U.S. Atorney possessed broad\ndiscretionary authority to proceed as he saw fit, authority that he could delegate to subordinates,\nand that Acosta’s exercise of his discretionary authority did not breach any clear and unambiguous\nstandard. As a result, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\n\n2o2 The failure to fully advise a supervisor of relevant and material facts can warrant a finding that the subordinate\n\natorney has not acted in “good faith.” OPR did not find evidence supporting such a conclusion here, and Acosta did\n\nnot claim that he was unaware of material facts needed to make his decision.\n\nl34\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l72", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023175.jpg": "agreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>.”\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM 8§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o6 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l75", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023178.jpg": "3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafafia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l78", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023181.jpg": "narrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.?!”_ The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?!3\n2. The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by Reasonable\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natorneys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at .. . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.?'* OPR also\n2l2 In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“nolitically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have jotned with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l8l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023184.jpg": "record, no restitution, no sex offender status, publication at a trial of\nthe names of certain victims that didn’t want their names revealed\nand the general difficulties of a trial for the victims and their\nfamilies.\n\nAlthough his emails shoued that, at the time, he advocated for prosecution of Epstein,\nLourie told OPR it was also his general recollection that “everybody at the USAO working on the\nmater had expressed concerns at various times about the long-term viability of a federal\nprosecution of Epstein due to certain factual and legal hurdles, as well as issues with the\ncooperation and desires of the victims.”\n\nSimilarly, Menchel—who had experience prosecuting sexual assault crimes—recalled\nunderstanding that many of the victims were unwilling to go forward and would have experienced\nadditional trauma as a result of a trial, and some had made statements exonerating Epstein.\nMenchel told OPR he believed that if the USAO had filed the proposed charges against Epstein,\nEpstein would have elected to go to trial. In Menchel’s view, the USAO therefore had to weigh\nthe risk of losing at trial, and thereby re-traumatizing the victims, against the benefits gained\nthrough a negotiated result, which ensured that Epstein served time in jail, registered as a sexual\noffender, and made restitution to his victims.\n\nSloman also recalled witness challenges and concerns about the viability of the\ngovernment’s legal theories. He told OPR:\n\n[I]t seemed to me you had a tranche of witnesses who were not going\nto be reliable. You had a tranche [of] witnesses who were going to\nbe severely impeached. People who loved Jeffrey Epstein who\nthought he was a Svengali . . . who were going to say I told him I\nwas l8 years old.\n\nYou had witnesses who were scared to death of the public light\nbeing shoun on them because their parents didn’t even knou -- had\nvery vulnerable victims. You had all of these concerns.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he recalled discussions with his senior managers about the victims’\ngeneral credibility and reluctance to testify and the evidentiary strength of the case, all of which\nfactored into the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. He acknouledged that his understanding of the facts was not\n“sranular” and did not encompass a detailed understanding of each victim’s expected testimony,\nbut he trusted that his “team” had already “done the diligence necessary” to make\nrecommendations about the evidentiary strength of the case. Acosta recalled discussing the facts\nwith Sloman and Menchel, and possibly Lourie, none of whom had as detailed an understanding\nof the facts as Villafafia. Nevertheless, OPR credits Acosta’s statement that he reasonably\nbelieved, based on his conversations with others who expressed this view, that a trial would pose\nsignificant evidentiary challenges.\n\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony regarding witness challenges,\nincluding the FBI co-case agent, who recalled during his OPR interview that some of the victims\nhad expressed concern for their safety and “a lot of them d[id]n’t want to take the stand, and\n\nl46\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l84", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023186.jpg": "The USAO might have been able to surmount the evidentiary, legal, and policy issues\npresented by a federal prosecution of Epstein. Villafafia, in particular, believed she could have\nprevailed had she taken the case to trial, and even after the NPA was negotiated, she repeatedly\nrecommended declaring Epstein in breach and proceeding with an indictment, because she\ncontinued to have confidence in the case.” Oosterban and others also believed that the\ngovernment would succeed at trial. Furthermore, the victims were not a uniform group. Some of\nthem were afraid of testifying or having their identities made public; others wanted Epstein\nprosecuted, but even among those, it is not clear hou many expressed a willingness to testify at a\ntrial; and still others provided information favorable to Epstein. In the end, Acosta assumed\nresponsibility for deciding hou to resolve the Epstein investigation and weighing the risks and\nbenefits of a trial versus those of a pre-charge disposition. His determination that a pre-charge\ndisposition was appropriate was not unreasonable under the circumstances.\n\nAlthough evidentiary and witness issues explain the subject supervisors’ concerns about\nwinning a potential trial and why the USAO would have sought some sort of pre-charge\ndisposition, they do not fully explain why Acosta decided to pursue a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> as\nopposed to a traditional federal plea agreement. OPR did not find in the contemporaneous records\na memorandum or other memorialization of the reasoning underlying Acosta’s decision to offer a\nstate-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> or the terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7.\n\nAccording to Acosta, “In 2oo6, it would have been extremely unusual for any United States\nAtorney’s Office to become involved in a state solicitation case, even one involving underage\nteens,” because solicitation was “the province of state prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR that he\ndeveloped “a preference for deferring to the state” to “make it clear that [the USAO was] not\nstepping on something that is a purely local mater, because we [didn’t] want bad precedent for\nthe sake of the larger human trafficking issue.” Acosta also told OPR that it was his understanding\nthat the PBPD would not have brought the case to federal investigators if the State Atorney’s\nOffice had pursued a sanction against Epstein that included jail time and sexual offender\nregistration. Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in the case as limited to preventing the “manifest\ninjustice” that, in Acosta’s view, would have resulted from the state’s original plea proposal.\nAcosta acknouledged that if the investigation had begun in the federal system, he would not have\nviewed the terms set out in the NPA as a satisfactory result, but it was adequate to serve as a\n“backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he described as “a polite way of saying[,\n“Jencouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]” In sum, Acosta told OPR that the Epstein case\nlay in “uncharted territory,” there was no certainty that the USAO would prevail if it went to trial,\nand a potentially unfavorable outcome had to be “weighed against a certain plea with registration\nthat would make sure that the public knew that this person was a sex offender.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he discussed the case primarily with Sloman and Menchel, and both\ntold OPR that while they did not share Acosta’s federalism concerns, they recalled that Acosta had\nthe terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7. Therefore, any allegations against the prosecutors could not have\nplayed a significant role in Acosta’s decisions as reflected in the term sheet.\n\n22o Sloman told OPR that Villafafia “always believed in the case.”\nl48\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l86", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023187.jpg": "been concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.*”” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n72l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . | was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\n\n222 Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\n\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\n\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\n\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\n\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\n\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l87", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023190.jpg": "friendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.?”*\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l9o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023192.jpg": "Menchel told OPR that when he and Sanchez were in the USAO, they had a social\nrelationship, which included, in 2oo3, “a handful of dates over a period of two to three weeks. We\ndecided that . . . this was probably best not to pursue, and we mutually agreed to not do that.”?°\nApart from that, he stated they were “close” and “hung out,” and he asserted that this was knoun\nin the office at the time. Menchel said that his relationship with Sanchez “changed dramatically”\nwhen she left the office for private practice, and that by the time he became involved in the Epstein\ninvestigation, he had dated and married his wife, and his contact with Sanchez would “most likely”\nhave been at office events and when she atended his wedding.””’ Menchel added, “[T]hat was\nthree and a half years [prior] for a very brief period of time, and I don’t think I gave it a moment’s\nthought.”\n\nWhen asked by OPR about the basis for the decision to make an offer of a two-year term\nof incarceration, Menchel said that he did not recall discussions about the two-year offer and did\nnot recall hou the office arrived at that figure. In response to OPR’s question, Menchel stated that\nhis relationship with Sanchez did “[n]ot at all” affect his handling of the Epstein case. Moreover,\nMenchel asserted that the contemporaneous documentary record supports a conclusion that it was\nAcosta, not Menchel, who made the decision to resolve the case with the two-year term.\n\nOPR carefully considered the documentary record on this point, as well as the statements\nto OPR from Menchel, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta, and concludes that there is no evidence\nsupporting the suggestion that the plea was instigated by Menchel as a favor to defense counsel.\nThe USAO’s first plea overture to defense counsel, which took place sometime before June 26,\n2oo7, occurred when Menchel spoke with Sanchez about the possibility of resolving the federal\ncase with a state plea that required jail time and sexual offender registration. According to the\nemail, “[iJt was a non-starter” for the defense. In the lengthy email exchange with Villafafia in\nearly July 2oo7, Menchel told her that his discussion with Sanchez about a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>\nwas made with Acosta’s “full knouledge.” Acosta corroborated this statement, telling OPR that\nalthough he did not remember a specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, he was certain Menchel would not have discussed this potential <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> with defense\ncounsel “without having discussed it with me.”??8 Moreover, the defense did not immediately\n226 Acosta, Sloman, and Lourie each told OPR that in 2oo7, he was not aware that Menchel had previously dated\nSanchez. OPR questioned the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer regarding whether Menchel had an\nobligation to inform his supervisors of his dating relationship. The Professional Responsibility Officer said that it\nwould depend on “hou long the relationship was and hou compromised the individual felt he might appear to be,”\nbut he would have expected Menchel to raise the issue with Acosta. The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR\nthat if he had been approached for advice at the time, he would have asked for more facts, but “[g]iven the sensitivity\nof the [Epstein] mater, [my advice] would probably have been to tell him to step back and let somebody else take it\nover.” Menchel told OPR that if his relationship with Sanchez had turned into something more than a handful of\ndates, he would have advised his supervisors. Although OPR does not conclude Menchel’s prior relationship with\nSanchez influenced the Epstein investigation, OPR assesses that it would have been prudent for Menchel to have\ninformed his supervisors so they could make an independent assessment as to whether his continued involvement in\nthe Epstein investigation might create the appearance of a loss of impartiality.\n22H Menchel’s Outlook records also indicate he scheduled lunch with Sanchez on at least one occasion, in early\n2oo6, after she left the USAO.\n\n228 In addition, Villafafia recalled Menchel stating at the July 26, 2oo7 meeting that “Alex has decided to offer\na two year state deal.”\nl54\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l92", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023194.jpg": "including one called by the USAO to offer the NPA term sheet <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>—and a sixth meeting\ntogether with the State Atorney and the lead state prosecutor to discuss the state plea.

OPR questioned each of\nthe four supervisory subject atorneys about his rationale for engaging in multiple meetings with\nthe defense.\n\nLourie could not recall his reasoning for meeting with Epstein’s defense counsel, but he\ntold OPR that his general practice was to meet with defense counsel when asked to do so. Lourie\nrecognized that some prosecutors—like Villafafia—viewed meeting with the defense as a sign of\n“weakness,” but in Lourie’s view, “information is pouer,” and as long as the USAO did not share\ninformation with the defense but rather listened to their arguments, meetings were “all pouer to\nus.” Lourie explained that by meeting with the defense, “[Y]ou’re geting the information that\nthey think is important; that they’re going to focus on. The witnesses that they think are liars ....\nAnd so you can form all of that into your strategy.” Lourie also told OPR that giving defense\ncounsel the opportunity to argue the defense position is an important “part of the process” that\nhelped ensure procedural fairness, allouing them to “believe that they are geting heard.” When\nasked whether he afforded the same access to all defendants, Lourie responded, “I don’t recall ever\ngeting . . . so many requests for meetings . . . and so many appeals and so many audiences that\n[Epstein’s atorneys] got. But this was I think the first time that that’s really happened.”\n\nMenchel, too, told OPR that his general view was that “ethically it’s appropriate” to give a\ndefense atorney “an audience,” and there was no real “dounside” to doing so. Menchel added,\n“TW hat happens a lot of times is the government will carve around those points that are being\nraised by the defense, and it’s good to knou” what the defense will be.\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Acosta rejected the notion that his meeting with defense counsel\nwas unusual or outside the norm. He told OPR that his initial meeting with the defense team,\nbefore the NPA was signed, was “not the first and only time that I granted a meeting . . . to defense\natorneys” who requested one. Acosta did not believe it was “atypical” for a U.S. Atorney to meet\nwith opposing counsel, particularly as a case was coming to <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. Sloman corroborated\nAcosta on this point, telling OPR that Acosta typically met with defense atorneys, and that the\nUSAO handled requests for meetings from Epstein’s counsel “in the normal course.” Furthermore,\nAcosta said that notwithstanding that meeting and all the other “process” granted to the defense\nby the USAO and the Department, “we successfully held firm in our positions” on the key elements\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>—that is, the requirements that Epstein be incarcerated, register as a sexual\noffender, and provide monetary damages to the victims.\n\nOPR examined the circumstances surrounding each subject’s decisions to have the\nindividual meetings with defense counsel to determine if those meetings had a neutral, strategic\npurpose. The first meeting, on February l, 2oo7, folloued a phone call between Lourie and one\nof Epstein’s atorneys, in which the atorney asked for a chance to “make a pitch” about the\nvictims’ lack of credibility and suggested that Epstein might agree to an interview follouing that\npitch. Villafafia objected to meeting with the defense, but she recalled that Lourie told her she was\nnot being a “strategic thinker,” and that he believed the meeting could lead to a debriefing of\nEpstein. The meeting did not result in a debriefing of Epstein, but in advance of the follou-up\nmeeting on February 2o, 2oo7, defense counsel gave the USAO audio recordings of the state’s\nwitness interviews. Contemporaneous documents indicate that Lourie was unpersuaded by the\ndefense arguments. After Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum, Lourie suggested\n\nl57\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l95", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023203.jpg": "With regard to her comment about “avoid[ing] the press,” Villafafia told OPR that her goal\nwas to protect the anonymity of the victims. She said that the case was far more likely to be\ncovered by the Palm Beach press, which had already writen articles about Epstein, than in Miami,\nand “if [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into the\ncourthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper.”\n\nIn evaluating the emails, OPR reviewed all the email exchanges between Villafafia, as well\nas Sloman and Acosta, and Lefkouitz and other defense counsel, including the portions redacted\nfrom the publicly released emails (except for a few to or from Acosta, copies of which OPR did\nnot locate in the USAO records). OPR also considered the emails in the broader context of\nVillafafia’s overall conduct during the federal investigation of Epstein. The documentary record,\nas well as witness and subject interviews, establishes that Villafafia consistently advocated in favor\nof prosecuting Epstein and worked for months touard that goal. She repeatedly pressed her\nsupervisors for permission to indict Epstein and made numerous efforts to expand the scope of the\ncase. She opposed meetings with the defense team, and nearly withdrew from the case because\nher supervisors agreed to those meetings. Villafafia objected to the decision to resolve the case\nthrough a guilty plea in state court, and she engaged in a lengthy and heated email exchange with\nMenchel about that subject. When she was assigned the task of creating an agreement to effect\nthat <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, Villafafia fought hard during the ensuing negotiations to hold the USAO’s position\ndespite defense counsel’s aggressive tactics.\n\nOPR also considered statements of her supervisors regarding her interactions with defense\ncounsel. Sloman, in particular, told OPR that reports that Villafafia “was soft on Epstein...\ncouldn’t have been further from the truth.” Sloman added that Villafafia “did her best to implement\nthe decisions that were made and to hold Epstein accountable.” Lourie similarly told OPR that\nwhen he read the district court’s February 2ol9 opinion in the CVRA litigation and the emails\nfrom Villafafia cited in that opinion, he was “surprised to see hou nice she was to them. And she\nwinds up taking it on the chin for being so nice to them. When I knou the whole time she was the\none who wanted to go after him the most.” The AUSA who assisted Villafafia on the investigation\ntold OPR “everything that [Villafafia] did . . . was, as far as I could tell, [ ] completely pro\nprosecution.”\n\nBecause the emails in question were publicly disclosed without context and without other\ninformation shouing Villafafia’s consistent efforts to prosecute Epstein and to assist victims, a\npublic narrative developed that Villafafia colluded with defense counsel to benefit Epstein at the\nexpense of the victims. After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that\nnarrative to be inaccurate. The USAO’s and Villafafia’s interactions with the victims can be\ncriticized, as OPR does in several respects in this Report, but the evidence is clear that any missteps\nVillafafia may have made in her interactions with victims or their atorneys were not made for the\npurpose of silencing victims. Rather, the evidence shous that Villafafia, in particular, cared deeply\nabout Epstein’s victims. Before the NPA was signed, she raised to her supervisors the issue of\nconsulting with victims, and after the NPA was signed, she drafted leters to notify victims\nidentified in the federal investigation of the pending state plea proceeding and inviting them to\nappear. The draft leters led defense counsel to argue to Department management that Villafafia\nand Sloman commited professional misconduct by “threaten[ing] to send a highly improper and\nunusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” of the listed victims. Given the full context of Villafafia’s\nconduct throughout her tenure on the case, OPR concludes that her explanations for her emails are\n\nl65\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232o3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023208.jpg": "successful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based <span class=\"highlight\">Resolution</span>\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023213.jpg": "Epstein’s state guilty plea.°° As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”>*!\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerms about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.”°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2oo Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\n25 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n252 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstem and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232l3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023215.jpg": "the federal investigation in exchange for a plea in state court to a charge that carried a two-year\nsentence.

Although the co-case agent could not recall who was present, the case agent\nrecalled that Menchel led the meeting, which occurred while the litigation was still pending.\n\nEven after the NPA two-year state plea <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> was presented to the defense, Villafafia\ncontinued to press ahead to have the court resolve the issue concerning the defense production of\nthe computer equipment. On August lo, 2oo7, she asked Lourie for authorization to oppose\nEpstein’s efforts to stay the litigation until after an anticipated meeting between the USAO and the\ndefense, informing Lourie that a victim interviewed that week claimed she started seeing Epstein\nat age l4 and had been photographed in the nude. A few days later, Villafafia told defense counsel\nthat she had “conferred with the appropriate people, and we are not willing to agree to a stay.”\nDefense counsel then contacted Lourie, who agreed to postpone the hearing until after the\nupcoming meeting with Acosta. After the meeting, and when the court sought to reschedule the\nhearing, Villafafia emailed Sloman to ask if she should “put it off’; he replied, “Yes,” and the\nhearing was re-set for September l8, 2oo7. As negotiations touards the NPA progressed,\nhouever, the hearing was postponed indefinitely. Ultimately the NPA itself put the issue to rest\nby specifying that all legal process would be held in abeyance unless and until Epstein breached\nthe agreement.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she had learned through law enforcement channels that the defense\nteam had reviewed the contents of Epstein’s computers. She told OPR that, in her view, “the fact\nthat the defense was trying desperately to put off the hearing . . . was further evidence of the\nimportance of the evidence.”\n\nOPR questioned Acosta about the decisions to initiate, and continue with, the NPA\nnegotiations while the litigation concerning the computers was still pending, and to agree to\npostpone the litigation rather than exhausting all efforts to obtain and review the computer\nevidence. Acosta told OPR that he had no recollection of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the missing\ncomputers, but he believed that “there was a desire to move quickly as opposed to slouly”\nregarding the plea.\n\nMenchel, Sloman, and Lourie also all told OPR that they did not remember Villafafia’s\nefforts to obtain the computers or recalled the issue only “vaguely.” Menchel expressed surprise\nto OPR that a prosecutor could obtain “an entire computer” through the method utilized by\nVillafafia, telling OPR, “I had not heard of that.” Houever, the contemporaneous records shou\nthat Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie had each been aware in 2oo7 of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s missing computer equipment.\n\nVillafafia kept Menchel, in particular, well informed of her efforts to obtain the computer\nequipment. She sent to Menchel, or copied him on, several emails about her plan to obtain the\ncomputer equipment; specifically, her emails on May l8, 2oo7, July 3, 2oo7, and July l6, 2oo7,\nall discussed her proposed steps. Villafafia told OPR that Lourie was involved in early discussions\nabout her proposal to obtain the evidence.

In this case, houever, given the unorthodox nature of the\nstate-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, the fact that Acosta’s decision to pursue it set the case on a wholly different\ntrack than what had been originally contemplated by his experienced staff, the nature and scope of\nEpstein’s criminal conduct, the circumstances surrounding the removal of the computers from\nEpstein’s residence, and the potential for obtaining evidence revealing serious additional criminal\nconduct, Acosta had a responsibility to ensure that he was fully informed about the consequences\nof pursing the course of action that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flouing\nfrom the express terms of the NPA. In deciding to resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta lost sight\nof the bigger picture that the investigation was not completed and viable leads remained to be\npursued. The decision to forgo the government’s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and to\npursue significant investigative steps should have been made only after careful consideration of\nall the costs and benefits of the proposed action. OPR did not find evidence that Acosta fully\nconsidered the costs of ending the investigation prematurely.”\n\nC. OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of\n\nIncarceration, That It Was Tied to Traditional Sentencing Goals, or That It\nSatisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution\n\nThe heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency\nafforded him concerning his sentence. After offering a deal that required a “non-negotiable”\n24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an l8-month term of incarceration,\nknouing that gain time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served only l3 months.\nEpstein ultimately did not serve even that minimal sentence incarcerated on a full-time basis\nbecause the state alloued Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his\nsentence. As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything else that happened to [Epstein] is exactly what\nshould have happened to him. . . . He had to pay a lot of money. He had to register as a sex\noffender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”\n\nDue to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant\nevents, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of hou the original two-year sentence\nrequirement was developed or by whom. Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject\ninterviews: (l) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled\nguilty to an unspecified charge originally contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years\nrepresented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding\nthe need for a trial. As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of\nthe two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.”’ He elaborated,\n28s In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney objected to OPR’s conclusion that Acosta knew or\nshould have knoun about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater consideration\nto pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed. Acosta’s atorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in\nthat level of “granularity”; that his “‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that\nit was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him. For the reasons stated above, OPR\nnonetheless concludes that having developed a unique <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> to a federal investigation, Acosta had a greater\nobligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232l7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023218.jpg": "“T’m reconstructing memories of ... l2 years ago. I can speculate that at some point, the mater\ncame up, and I or someone else said . .. what would the original charges have likely brought? And\nsomeone said this amount.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall who initially proposed this\nmethod, but he believed that it likely did not result from a single specific discussion but rather\nfrom conversations over a course of time. Acosta could not recall specifically with whom he had\nthese discussions, other than that it would have been Lourie, Menchel, or Sloman. Villafafia was\nnot asked for her views on a two-year sentence, and she had no input into the decision before it\nwas made. Villafafia told OPR that she examined the state statutes and could not validate that a\nstate charge would have resulted in a 24-month sentence. OPR also examined applicable state\nstatutes and the Florida sentencing guidelines, but could not confirm that Epstein was, in fact,\nfacing a potential two-year sentence under charges contemplated by the PBPD.\n\nOn the other hand, during his OPR interview, Lourie “guess[ed]” that “somehou the\ndefense conveyed . . . we’re going to trial if it’s more than two years.” Menchel similarly told\nOPR that he did not knou hou the two year sentence was derived, but “obviously it was a number\nthat the office felt was palatable enough that [Epstein] would take” it. Sloman told OPR that he\nhad no idea hou the two-year sentence proposal was reached.\n\nThe contemporaneous documentary record, houever, provides no indication that Epstein’s\nteam proposed a two-year sentence of incarceration or initially suggested, before the USAO made\nits offer, that Epstein would accept a two-year term of incarceration. As late as July 25, 2oo7—\nonly days before the USAO provided the term sheet to defense counsel—Epstein’s counsel\nsubmited a leter to the USAO arguing that the federal government should not prosecute Epstein\nat all. Furthermore, after the initial “term sheet” was presented and negotiations for the NPA\nprogressed, Epstein’s team continued to strongly press for less or no time in jail.\n\nThe USAO had other charging and sentencing options available to it. The most obvious\nalternative to the two-year sentence proposal was to offer Epstein a plea to a federal offense that\ncarried a harsher sentence. If federally charged, Epstein was facing a substantial sentence under\nthe federal sentencing guidelines, l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment. Houever, it is unlikely that\nhe would have agreed to a plea that required a guidelines sentence, even one at the louer end of\nthe guidelines. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues had been concerned that Epstein\nwould opt to go to trial if charged and presented with the option of pleading to a guidelines\nsentence, and as previously discussed, there were both evidentiary and legal risks atendant upon\na trial in this case. If federally charged, Epstein’s sentencing exposure could have been managed\nby offering him a plea under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c) for a stipulated sentence,\nwhich requires judicial approval. Acosta rejected this idea, houever, apparently because of a\nperception that the federal district courts in the Southern District of Florida did not view Rule ll(c)\npleas favorably and might refuse to accept such a plea and thus limit the USAO’s options.\n\nAnother alternative was to offer Epstein a plea to conspiracy, a federal charge that carried\na maximum five-year sentence. Shortly after Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum\nto her supervisors, Lourie recommended to Acosta charging Epstein by criminal complaint and\noffering a plea to conspiracy “to make a plea atractive.” Similarly, before learning that Menchel\nhad already discussed a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> with Epstein’s counsel, Villafafia had considered\noffering Epstein a plea to one count of conspiracy and a substantive charge, to be served\nconcurrently with any sentence he might receive separately as a result of the state’s outstanding\n\nl8o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023219.jpg": "indictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>\nthat ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would\nbe sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\ntraditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis. In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232l9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023221.jpg": "the defendant faced decades in prison for sexual crimes against minors with such an insignificant\nterm of incarceration, and made numerous other concessions to the defense. As OPR has set forth\nin substantial detail in this Report, OPR did not find evidence to support allegations that the\nprosecutors sought to benefit Epstein at the expense of the victims. Instead, the result can more\nappropriately be tied to Acosta’s misplaced concerns about interfering with a traditionally state\ncrime and intruding on state authority. Acosta was also unwilling to abandon the path that he had\nset, even when Villafafia and Lourie advocated to end the negotiations and even though Acosta\nhimself had learned that the state authorities may not have been a reliable partner.\n\nMany of the problems that developed might have been avoided had Acosta engaged in\ngreater consultation with his staff before making key decisions. The contemporaneous records\nrevealed problems with communication and coordination among the five key participants. Acosta\nwas involved to a greater extent and made more decisions than he did in a typical case. Lourie\ntold OPR that it was “unusual to have a U.S. Atorney get involved with this level of detail.”\nMenchel told OPR, “I knou we would have spoken about this case a lot, okay? And I’m sure with\nJeff as well, and there were conversations -- a meeting that I had with Marie and Andy as well.”\nLourie similarly told OPR:\n\nWell, ... he would have been talking to Jeff and Mat, talking to me\nto the extent that he did, he would have been looking at the Pros\nMemo and... the guidance from CEOS, he would have been\nreading the defense atorney’s leters, maybe talking to the State\nAtorney, I don’t knou, just . . . all these different sources of\ninformation he was -- I’m comfortable that he knew the case, you\nknou, that he was, he was reading everything. Apparently, he, you\nknou, read the Pros Memo, he read all the stuff. ...\n\nAt the same time, Acosta was significantly removed, both in physical distance and in levels\nin the supervisory chain, from the individuals with the most knouledge of the facts of the case—\nVillafafia and, to a lesser extent, Lourie. Lourie normally would have signed off on the prosecution\nmemorandum on his oun, but as he told OPR, he recognized that the case was going to go through\nthe front office “[b]ecause there was front office involvement from the get go.” Yet, although\nAcosta became involved at certain points in order to make decisions, he did not view himself as\noverseeing the investigation or the details of implementing his decisions. OPR observed that as a\nconsequence, management of the case suffered from both an absence of ounership of the\ninvestigation and failures in communication that affected critical decisions.\n\nOn occasion, Villafafia included Acosta directly in emails, but often, information upon\nwhich Acosta relied for his decisions and information about the decisions Acosta had made\ntraveled through multiple layers between Acosta and Villafafia. Villafafia did draft a detailed,\nanalytical prosecution memorandum, but it is not clear that Acosta read it and instead may have\nrelied on conversations primarily with Menchel and later with Sloman after Menchel’s departure.\nDespite these discussions, though, it is not clear that Acosta was aware of certain information, such\nas Oosterban’s strong opinion from the outset in favor of the prosecution or of Villafafia’s\nconcerns and objections to a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> or the final NPA. Acosta interpreted the state\nindictment on only one charge as a sign that the case was weak evidentially, but it is not clear that\nwhen making his decision to resolve the mater though a state-based plea, he knew the extent to\n\nl83\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2322l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023222.jpg": "which Villafafia and Lourie believed that the state had intentionally failed to aggressively pursue\na broader state indictment.\n\nOne example illustrates this communication gap. In a September 2o, 2oo7 email to Lourie\nasking him to read the latest version of the proposed “hybrid” federal plea agreement (calling for\nEpstein to plead to both state and federal charges), Acosta noted, “I don’t typically sign plea\nagreements. We should only go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement. I\ndidn’t even sign the public corruption or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not be the first.”\n(Emphasis added.) In his email to Villafafia, Lourie atached Acosta’s email and instructed\nVillafafia to “change the signature block to your name and send as final to Jay [Lefkouitz].”\n(Emphasis added.) Villafafia raised no objection to signing the agreement. Acosta told OPR that\nhe wanted to give the “trial team” a chance to “speak up and let him knou” if they did not feel\ncomfortable with the agreement. Villafafia, houever, told OPR that she did not understand that\nshe was being given an opportunity to object to the agreement; rather, she believed Acosta wanted\nher to sign it because he was taking an “‘arm’s length” approach and signaling this “was not his\ndeal.” The fact that the top decision maker believed he was giving the line AUSA an opportunity\nto reflect and stop the process if she believed the deal was inappropriate, but the line AUSA\nbelieved she was being ordered to sign the agreement because her boss wanted to distance himself\nfrom the decision, reflects a serious communication gap.\n\nAs another example, at one point, Villafafia, frustrated and concerned about the decisions\nbeing made concerning a possible <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, requested a meeting with Acosta; in a sternly worded\nrebuke, Menchel rejected the request. Although Menchel told OPR that he was not prohibiting\nVillafafia from speaking to Acosta, Villafafia interpreted Menchel’s email to mean that she could\nnot seek a meeting with Acosta. As a consequence, Acosta made his decision about a state\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> and the term of incarceration without any direct input from Villafafia. Acosta told OPR\nthat he was unaware that Villafafia had sought a meeting with him and he would have met with\nher if she had asked him directly. OPR did not find any writen evidence of a meeting involving\nboth Acosta—the final decision maker—and Villafafia—the person most knouledgeable about the\nfacts and the law—before Acosta made his decision to resolve the case through state charges or to\noffer the two-year term, and Villafafia said she did not have any input into the decision. Although\na U.S. Atorney is certainly not required to have such direct input, and it may be that Menchel\npresented what he believed to be Villafafia’s views, OPR found no evidence that Acosta was aware\nof Villafafia’s strong views about, and objections to, the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>.”*°\n\nTwo logistical problems hindered effective communication. First, the senior managers\ninvolved in the case—Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel—had offices located in Miami, while the\noffices of the individuals most familiar with facts of the case—Villafafia and, to a lesser extent,\nLourie—were located in West Palm Beach. Consequently, Villafafia’s discussions with her senior\n256 In her 2ol7 Declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that, given the challenges of obtaining\nvictims’ cooperation with a federal prosecution, “I believed and still believe that a negotiated <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the mater\nwas in the best interests of the [USAO] and the victims as a whole. The [USAO] had also reached that same\nconclusion.” Several subjects pointed to this statement as indicating that Villafafia in fact supported the NPA. In her\nOPR interview, houever, Villafafia drew a distinction between resolving the investigation through negotiations that\nled to what in her view was a reasonable outcome, which she would have supported, and “this negotiated <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>” —\nthat is, the NPA—which she did not support.\n\nl84\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23222", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023223.jpg": "managers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.”*”\n\nSecond, key personnel were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the .. . bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third\noad In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23223", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023224.jpg": "parties.7°* The rush to reach a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> should not have led the USAO to agree to such a\nsignificant provision without a full consideration of the potential consequences and justification\nfor the provision. It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n258 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort. . ..\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s\n\nunderstood that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you\n\nknou the husband’s willing to go and take the weight .... This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23224", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023225.jpg": "from Villafafia and others, but given the highly unusual procedure being considered, his decision\nshould have been made only after a full consideration of all of the possible ramifications and\nconsequences of pushing the mater into the state court system, with which neither Villafafia nor\nthe other subjects had experience, along with consideration of the legal and evidentiary issues and\npossible means of overcoming those issues. OPR did not find evidence indicating that such a\nmeeting or discussion with the full team was held before the decision was made to pursue the\nstate-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term of incarceration, or\nbefore the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed. As Acosta later recognized and told OPR,\n“And a question that I think is a valid one in my mind is, did the focus on, let’s just get this done\nand get a jail term, mean that we didn’t take a step back and say, let’s evaluate hou this train is\nmoving?”\n\nMany features of the NPA were given inadequate consideration, including core provisions\nlike the term of incarceration and sexual offender registration, with the result that Epstein was able\nto manipulate the process to his benefit. Members of his senior staff held differing opinions about\nsome of the issues that Acosta felt were important and that factored into his decision-making.\nThere does not seem to be a point, houever, at which those differing opinions were considered\nwhen forming a strategy; rather, Acosta seems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him\nfolloued and atempted to implement but without a considered strategy beyond ataining the three\ncore elements. As the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had authority to proceed in this manner, but many of\nthe problems that developed with the NPA might have been avoided with a more thoughtful\napproach. As Acosta belatedly recognized, “[I]f I was advising a fellou U.S. Atorney today, I\nwould say, think it through.”\n\nNo one of the individual problems discussed above necessarily demonstrates poor\njudgment by itself. Houever, in combination, the evidence shous that the state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>\nwas ill conceived from the start and that the NPA resulted from a flawed decision-making process.\nFrom the time the USAO opened its investigation, Acosta recognized the federal interest in\nprosecuting Epstein, yet after that investigation had run for more than a year, he set the\ninvestigation on a path not originally contemplated. Having done so, he had responsibility for\nensuring that he received and considered all of the necessary information before puting an end to\na federal investigation into serious criminal conduct. Acosta’s failure to adequately consider the\nfull ramifications of the NPA contributed to a process and ultimately a result that left not only the\nline AUSA and the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also caused victims and the public to question\nthe motives of the prosecutors and whether any reasonable measure of justice was achieved.\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he chose a course of\naction that was in marked contrast to the action that the Department would reasonably expect an\natorney exercising good judgment to take.\n\n259 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney acknouledged that “[t]he mater would have\nbenefited from more consistent staffing and atention.”\nl87\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23225", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023228.jpg": ". . .

The Case Agents and Villafafia Solicit Some Victims’ Opinions about\nResolving the Federal Investigation\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when she and the case agents met with victims, “we would ask\nthem hou they wanted the case to be resolved.”7*!\n\nAnd most of them wanted the case to be resolved via a plea. Some\nof them wanted him not to be prosecuted at all. Most of them did\nnot want to have to come to court and testify. They were very\nworried about their privacy rights.

And so, I felt like sending them back to\nthe State Atorney’s Office was not something that they would have\nsupported.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she also recalled that some victims “expressed . . . concern about\ntheir safety,” and were worried that Epstein would find out about their participation in the\ninvestigation. In her 2ol7 declaration submited in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that the\ntwo CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my\nrole was to evaluate the entire situation, consider the input received from all of the victims, and\nallou the Office to exercise its prosecutorial discretion accordingly.””* She also noted that some\nvictims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would\nhave on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”\n\nIn the FBI case agent’s 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During\ninterviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be\nprosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s]\n\nvictims .... A majority of the victims expressed concern about the\n\npossible disclosure of their identities to the public. A number of the\n\nvictims raised concerns about having to testify and/or their parents\n\nfinding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein. Additionally,\n28l Villafafia created for OPR a chart listing victims identified in the state and federal investigations, with\nnotations indicating several with whom Villafafia recalled discussing their opinions about resolving the case. The\nchart, houever, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafafia told OPR that the information contained in the\nchart was based on her memory of her interactions with each victim. OPR was unable to determine the details or\nextent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2oo7, because Villafafia did not have contemporaneous\nnotes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information\nabout the victims’ desired outcomes. The victims who provided information to OPR did not recall discussing potential\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal investigation with anyone from the government.\n282 In the declaration, Villafafia stated, “Jane Doe 2 specifically told me that she did not want Epstein\nprosecuted.”\n\n2ol\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23239", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023240.jpg": "for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall,\nmany of the victims were troubled about the existence of the\ninvestigation. They displayed feelings of embarrassment and\nhumiliation and were reluctant to talk to investigators. Some\nvictims who were identified through the investigation refused even\nto speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and\ngeting to the truth were always at the forefront of our handling of\nthe investigation.\nThe case agent told OPR that although she encountered victims who were “strong” and\n“believable,” she did not encounter any who vigorously advocated for the prosecution of Epstein.\nRather, “they were embarrassed,” “didn’t want their parents to knou,” and “wanted to forget.”?*\nAs of September 24, 2oo7, the date the NPA was signed, Villafafia informed Epstein\natorney Lefkouitz that she had compiled a preliminary list of victims including “34 confirmed\nminors” and 6 other potential minor victims who had not yet been interviewed by the FBI.7*4\nAlthough the government had contacted many victims before the NPA was signed, Villafafia\nacknouledged during the CVRA litigation that “individual victims were not consulted regarding\nthe agreement.”\nB. Before the NPA Is Signed, Villafafia Expresses Concern That Victims Have\nNot Been Consulted\nBefore the NPA was signed, Villafafia articulated to her supervisors concerns about the\ngovernment’s failure to consult with victims.\nl. July 2oo7: Villafafia’s Email Exchanges with Menchel\nIn July 2oo7, Villafafia learned that Menchel had discussed with defense counsel Sanchez\na possible state <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> to the federal investigation of Epstein. Villafafia was upset by this\ninformation, and sent a strongly worded email to Menchel voicing her concerns. (A full account\nof their email exchange is set forth at Chapter Two, Part One, Section IV.A.2.) In that email, she\ntold him that it was “inappropriate [for you] to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE, the victims, and me. These plea negotiations violate . . . all of the\n285 The case agent also noted that the victim who became CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 had expressed in her\nApril 2oo7 video-recorded FBI interview her opinion that “nothing should happen to Epstein.”\n284 The “victims’ list” for purposes of the NPA was intended to include the names of all individuals whom the\ngovernment was prepared to name in a charging document “as victims of an offense enumerated in l8 U.S.C. § 2255.”\nAlthough the charges Villafafia proposed on May l, 2oo7, were based on crimes against l3 victims, thereafter, as\nexplained in Chapter Two of this Report, she continued to revise the proposed charges, adding and removing victims\nas the federal investigation developed further evidence.

Perceiving Menchel’s rebuke as a criticism of her judgment, Villafafia\nresponded, “[R]aising concerns about the forgoten voices of victims in this case should not be\nclassified as a lapse in judgment” and that her “first and only concern in this case . . . is the victims.”\nMenchel told OPR that he did not view his conversation with Sanchez as a plea offer,\nasserted that he was not obligated to consult with victims during preliminary setlement\nnegotiations, and noted that he left the USAO before the NPA was fully negotiated or signed.\nMenchel told OPR that “you have discussions . . . with [the] defense all the time, and the notion\nthat even just having a general discussion is something that must be veted with victims . . . is not\neven ... in the same universe as to hou I think about this.” Menchel also observed that on the\nvery day that Villafafia criticized him for engaging in setlement negotiations without consulting\nher, the FBI, or the victims, Villafafia had herself sent an email to Sanchez offering “to discuss the\npossibility of a federal <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of Mr. Epstein’s case that could run concurrently with any state\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>,” without having spoken to the victims about her proposal.”°”\n285 Villafafia told OPR that “some victims, I felt strongly, would have objected to [a state-only disposition].”\nVillafafia stated to OPR that at the time Menchel engaged in such negotiations, he would only have been aware of the\nvictim information contained in her prosecution memorandum, which included information about the “effects on the\nvictims” but did not likely contain information as to “hou they would like the case resolved.” Villafafia asserted that\nMenchel “never reached out to any of the victims to find out what their position would be.” Menchel told OPR that\nthe allegations in Villafafia’s email that he violated the Ashcroft Memo, USAM, and the CVRA were “way out of line\nin terms of what the law is and the policies are.”\n286 As discussed, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not apply before charges were\nfiled against a defendant.\n287 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel asserted that her email to Sanchez was intended\nonly to determine whether Epstein was interested in opening plea negotiations.\n2o3\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2324l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023243.jpg": "Chief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.””?!

Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that\nwe had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek\napproval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the notification issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.””” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”???\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.”** Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate\n29l Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “he was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\n\n222 Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\na3 The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n2o4 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto ... instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23243", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023244.jpg": "disagreement” regarding the CVRA’s requirements.””> Oosterban’s disagreement was based on\npolicy considerations, and he told OPR that “from a policy perspective,” CEOS would not “take a\nposition that you wouldn’t consult with [the victims].” Oosterban also told OPR that whether or\nnot the law required it, the victims should have been given an opportunity “to weigh in directly,”\nbut he did not fault the USAO’s motivations for failing to provide that opportunity:\n\nThe people I knou, Andy [Lourie], Jeff [Sloman], . . . were trying\n\nto do the right thing. . . .

In addition, Villafafia and the case\nagents grew concerned that notifying the victims about the NPA monetary damages provision\nwould damage the victims’ credibility if Epstein breached the NPA and the case went to trial. In\nthe end, Acosta decided to defer to the State Atorney’s discretion whether to notify the victims\nabout the state plea, and information about the NPA and the monetary damages provision was not\nprovided to victims until after Epstein pled guilty in June 2oo8.\n\n299 Oosterban stated that, in retrospect, “maybe I should have been more aggressive with hou . . . I dealt with\n[the USAO].”\n296 The NPA nondisclosure provision stated: “The parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part\nof any public record.

Villafafia recalled that during a brief telephone consultation, the Professional\nResponsibility Officer advised her and the case agent that “it’s not really that big a concern, but if\nyou’re concerned about it then you should stop making the notification.”°* In her 2ol7 CVRA\ndeclaration, the case agent stated that after conferring with the USAO, the case agents stopped\nnotifying victims about the NPA.\n\nB. October 2oo7: Defense Atorneys Object to Government Victim Notifications\n\nWhile the case agents and Villafafia considered the impact that notifying the victims about\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the case might have on a potential trial, defense counsel also raised concerns\nabout what the victims could be told about the NPA. As discussed in Chapter Two, after the NPA\nwas signed on September 24, 2oo7, the USAO proposed using a special master to select the\natorney representative for the victims, which led to further discussions about the § 2255 provision.\nOn October 5, 2oo7, when defense atorney Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a leter responding to the\nUSAO’s proposal to use a special master, he cautioned that “neither federal agents nor anyone\nfrom your Office should contact the identified individuals to inform them of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the\ncase” because such communications would “violate the confidentiality of the agreement” and\nwould prevent Epstein from having control over “what is communicated to the identified\nindividuals at this most critical stage.” Lefkouitz folloued this communication with an October\nlo, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, arguing that “[n]either federal agents nor anyone from your Office should\ncontact the identified individuals to inform them of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the case.”*% Rather,\nLefkouitz wanted to “participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication to the identified\nindividuals.”\n\nOn October 23, 2oo7, Villafafia raised the issue of victim notification with Sloman, stating:\n\nWe also have to contact the victims to tell [them] about the outcome\nof the case and to advise them that an atorney will be contacting\nthem regarding possible claims against Mr. Epstein. If we don’t do\nthat, it may be a violation of the Florida Bar Rules for the selected\natorney to ‘cold call’ the girls.\n\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter Two, on October 23, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent Acosta\na leter stating that Epstein expected to enter a guilty plea in state court on November 2o, 2oo7,\n3o5 The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR that he did not recall the case agent contacting him about\nvictim notification, nor did he recall being involved in the Epstein mater before the CVRA litigation was instituted\nin July 2oo8 and he was assigned to handle the litigation. Villafafia told OPR that they consulted the Professional\nResponsibility Officer over the telephone, the call took no more than “five minutes,” and the Professional\nResponsibility Officer had no other exposure to the case and thus “wouldn’t have [any] context for it.”\n\n3o6 Lefkouitz also argued that direct contact with the victims could violate grand jury secrecy rules.\n2lo\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23248", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023249.jpg": "and thanking Acosta for agreeing on October l2, 2oo7, not to “contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this\nmater.”°°7 Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Acosta\nrevised to clarify the “inaccurate” representations made by Lefkouitz, in particular noting that\nAcosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact. The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\n\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\n\ncommunications that are typical in these maters. As an example,\n\nour Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them\n\nthat either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing]\n\nthem. Rest assured that we will continue to treat this mater as we\n\nwould any similarly situated case.\n\nIn a November 5, 2oo7 leter, Sloman complained to Lefkouitz that private investigators\nworking for Epstein had been contacting victims and asking whether government agents had\ndiscussed financial setlement with them. Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some circumstances.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?””>”\n\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to Investigate,\n\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\n\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been identified in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o7 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\n\nAo8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n\n3o9 Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to\ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”\n\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23249", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023250.jpg": "NPA.?!° The FBI reports of the victim interviews do not mention the NPA or indicate that the\nvictims were asked for their input regarding the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the case. Villafafia acknouledged\nthat she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the\nagreement because “at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and\nthat we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”\n\nOn October l2, 2oo7, the FBI Victim Specialist sent a VNS form notice leter to a victim\nthe case agents had interviewed two days earlier. This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim Specialist sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\nidentified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD.

The\n\nState does not have a procedure (like we do federally) where the\n\nCourt has to provide a separate room for victims who want to atend\n\njudicial proceedings, so I do not knou hou many victims will\n\nactually want to be present.?!!\nBelohlavek told OPR that she did not recall the conversation referenced by the FBI nor any\ncoordination between her office and federal officials to contact or notify victims about Epstein’s\nstate plea hearing.\n\nOn November l9, 2oo7, Villafafia decided that to avoid any misconduct accusations from\nthe defense about the information given to victims, she “would put the victim notification in\nwriting.” She provided Sloman with a draft victim notification leter, in which among other things,\n3lo Not all the individuals interviewed qualified for inclusion on the victim list. For example, one would not\ncooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third\nclaimed she had no contact with Epstein.\n\n3ll Villafafia told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or\ntwo victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”\n2l2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2325o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023251.jpg": "she would inform victims of the terms of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal case, including Epstein’s\nagreement to plead guilty to state charges and serve l8 months in county jail, and the victims’\nability to seek monetary damages against Epstein. The leter also would invite victims to appear\nat the state court hearing and make a statement under oath or provide a writen statement to be\nfiled by the State Atorney’s Office. Sloman and Villafafia exchanged edits on the draft victim\nnotification leter, and Villafafia also informed Sloman that “[t]here are a few girls who didn’t\nreceive the original leters, so I will need to modify the introductory portion of the leter for\nthose.”?””\n\nSloman informed Lefkouitz of the government’s need to meet its “statutory obligation\n(Justice for All Act of 2oo4) to notify the victims of the anticipated upcoming events and their\nrights associated with the agreement” and his intent to “notify the victims by leter after COB\nThursday, November 29.” Lefkouitz objected to the proposal to notify the victims, asserting that\nit was “incendiary and inappropriate” and not warranted under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4. He\nargued that the defense “should have a right to review and make objections to that submission\nprior to it being sent to any alleged victims.” He also insisted that if any notification leters were\nsent to “victims, who still have not been identified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein\nhas entered his plea” and that the leter should come from the atorney representative rather than\nthe government. On November 28, 2oo7, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia provided Lefkouitz\nwith the draft victim notification leter, which would advise victims that the state court plea was\nto occur on December l4, 2oo7.7\n\nIn a November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz strongly objected to the proposed draft\nnotification leter, arguing that the government was not obligated to send any leter to victims until\nafter Epstein’s plea and sentencing. Lefkouitz also contended that the victims had no right to\nappear at Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing or to provide a writen statement for such a\nproceeding. In a November 3o, 2oo7 reply leter to Lefkouitz, Acosta did not address the\nsubstance of Lefkouitz’s arguments, but accused the defense team of “in essence presenting\ncollateral challenges” delaying effectuation of the NPA, and asserted that if Epstein was\ndissatisfied with the NPA, “we stand ready to unwind the Agreement” and proceed to trial. Shortly\nthereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by leter that he had directed prosecutors “not to\nissue victim notification leters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time\nto review these options with your client.” In the leter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that\nVillafafia had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary\ndamages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during\nthe investigation phase of this mater.”\n\nOn December 5, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz sent a leter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman\nand Assistant Atorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with\n3l2 On November 28, 2oo7, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafafia that\nonly l5 of the then-knoun victims had received victim notification leters from either the FBI or the USAO. On\nDecember 6, 2oo7, the lead case agent reported to Villafafia that she was “still holding many of the original V/W\nleters addressed to victims from the USAO.”\n\n3l3 Villafafia understood the state prosecutors had set the December l4, 2oo7 date, and emailed them for\nconfirmation, stating, “[I]f the mater is set for the l4th, please let me knou so I can include that in my victim\nnotifications.”\n2l3\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2325l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023252.jpg": "the USAO’s interpretation of the agreement and “the use of Section 2255.” The Starr and\nLefkouitz leter asserted it was “wholly inappropriate” for the USAO to send the proposed victim\nnotification leter “under any circumstances,” and “strongly urg[ed]” Acosta to withhold the\nnotification leter until after the defense was able “to discuss this mater with Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Fisher.”\n\nThe follouing day, Sloman sent a leter to Lefkouitz, with copies to Acosta and Villafafia,\nasserting that the VRRA obligated the government to notify victims of the l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nproceedings as “other relief” to which they were entitled. Sloman also stated that the VRRA\nobligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning restitution to which\nthey may be entitled and “the earliest possible’ notice of the status of the investigation, the filing\nof charges, and the acceptance of a plea.*!4 (Emphasis in original). Sloman added:\n\nJust as in l8 U.S.C. § 377l [the CVRA], these sections are not\n\nlimited to proceedings in a federal district court. Our Non-\n\nProsecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by\n\nallouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense. The victims\n\nidentified through the federal investigation should be appropriately\n\ninformed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.*!°\nSloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafafia or the\nFBI case agent with questions or concerns: “Again, federal law requires that victims have the\n‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’” Sloman advised\nthe defense: “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed\nto Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation. Those questions are appropriately directed to\nlaw enforcement.”\n\nAlong with this leter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkouitz for comment a revised draft victim\nnotification leter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense. The\nleter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been completed,” Epstein would\nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of imprisonment at sentencing,\nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The\nleter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing:\n\nAs I mentioned above, as part of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal\n\ninvestigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.\n\nMr. Epstein’s change of plea and sentencing will occur on\n\nDecember l4, 2oo7, at —_ a.m., before Judge Sandra K. McSorley,\n3l4 See 42 U.S.C. § lo6o7(c)(l)(B) and (c)(3).\n3l5 Emphasis in original. Sloman also stated that the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is\nsimply informing the victims of their rights.” Villafafia informed OPR that Sloman approved and signed the leter,\nbut she was the primary author of the document. OPR notes that Villafafia was the principal author of most\ncorrespondence in the Epstein case, and that follouing the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the leter went\nout with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three atorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence\nbefore a final version was sent to the defense.\n\n2l4\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23252", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023254.jpg": "her a victim for purposes of the federal charges, and continued to treat her as a victim because she\nwanted “to go above and beyond in terms of caring for the victims.”\n\nE.

Regarding issues relevant to victim notification, in his transmital\nleter, Starr asserted that the “latest episodes involving [§] 2255 notification to the alleged victims\nput illustratively in bold relief our concerns that the ends of justice, time and time again, are not\nbeing served.” By way of example, Starr complained the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it\nwas clear from the girl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a\nvictim.”\n\nIn his submissions, Lefkouitz argued that the government was not required to notify\nvictims of the § 2255 provision:\n\nVillafafia’s decision to utilize a civil remedy statute in the place of\na restitution fund for the alleged victims eliminates the notification\nrequirement under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4, a federal law that\nrequires federal authorities to notify victims as to any available\nrestitution, not of any potential civil remedies. Despite this fact,\n[she] proposed a Victims Notification leter to be sent to the alleged\nfederal victims.\n\nLefkouitz also argued that a victim trust fund would provide a more appropriate\nmechanism for compensating the victims than the government’s proposed use of l8 U.S.C. § 2255,\nand a trust fund would not violate Epstein’s due process rights. Lefkouitz took issue with the\ngovernment’s “assertion” that the USAO was obligated to send a victim notification leter to the\nalleged victims, or even that it was appropriate for the USAO to do so. Lefkouitz further argued\nthat the government misinterpreted both the CVRA and the VRRA, because neither applied to a\npublic, state court proceeding involving the entry of a plea on state charges.\n\nIn a leter from Villafafia to Lefkouitz, responding to his allegations that she had\ncommited misconduct, she specifically addressed the “false” allegations that the government had\n3l8 As noted previously, in April 2oo7, this victim gave a video-recorded interview to the FBI that was favorable\nto Epstein. Villafafia told OPR she was instructed by either Sloman or Acosta “not to consider [this individual] as a\nvictim for purposes of the NPA because she was not someone whom the Office was prepare[d] to include in” a federal\ncharging document. Accordingly, the victim who became “Jane Doe #2” was not included on the victim list ultimately\nfurnished to the defense. The atorney who was representing this victim at the time of her FBI interview was paid by\nEpstein, and she subsequently obtained different counsel.\n\n2l6\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23254", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023256.jpg": "review the appropriateness of the potential federal charges and the government’s “unprecedentedly\nexpansive interpretation” of l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn a December l9, 2oo7 response to the defense team, Acosta offered to revise two\nparagraphs in the NPA to resolve “disagreements” with the defense and to clarify that the parties\nintended Epstein’s § 2255 liability to “place these identified victims in the same position as they\nwould have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.” Acosta also advised\nthat although the USAO intended to notify the victims of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal investigation,\nthe USAO would leave to the State Atorney the decision whether to notify victims about the state\nproceedings:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court sentencing\nhearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim notification leter and\nthe statute. I would note that the United States provided the draft\nleter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition, First Assistant United\nStates Atorney Sloman already incorporated in the leter several\nedits that had been requested by defense counsel. I agree that [the\nCVRA] applies to notice of proceedings and results of investigations\nof federal crimes as opposed to the state crime.

He explained:\n\n[E]ven though we didn’t have a legal obligation, I felt that the\n\nvictims were going to be notified and the state was going . .. to\n\nfulfill that obligation, and even as another failsafe, [the victims]\n\nwould be notified of . . . the restitution mechanism that we had set\n\nup on their behalf.\nSloman acknouledged that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims,\n\nit was [of] concern that this was going to break doun and... . result\n\nin us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be\n\nwitnesses and if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey,\n\nyou’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s . . . going to be instant\n\nimpeachment for the defense.\n357 Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek told OPR that federal victims who were not a party to the state case\nwould not have been able to stmply appear at the state plea hearing and participate in the proceedings. Rather, such a\npresentation would have required coordination between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office and additional\ninvestigation of the victims’ allegations and proposed statements by the State Atorney’s Office.\na8 In an email a few months earlier, Villafafia noted, “The state indictment [for solicitation of adult prostitution]\nis related to two girls. One of those girls is included in the federal [charging document), the other is not.”\n359 As noted in Chapter Two, Villafafia had stopped communicating with the State Atorney’s Office regarding\nthe state case follouing Epstein’s defense team’s objections to those communications.\n\n233\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2327l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023274.jpg": "civil suits that were pending against Epstein.*® Villafafia also emailed one of the pro bono\natorneys she had engaged to help victims avoid defense harassment, informing him that the federal\ninvestigation had been resolved through a state plea and that Epstein had an “agreement” with the\nUSAO “requir[ing] him to make certain concessions regarding possible civil suits brought by the\nvictims.” Villafafia advised Goldberger: “The FBI has received several calls regarding the [NPA].\nI do not knou whether the title of the document was disclosed when the [NPA] was filed under\nseal, but the FBI and our Office are declining comment if asked.”\n\nB. July 7, 2oo8: The CVRA Litigation Is Initiated\n\nOn July 3, 2oo8, victims’ atorney Edwards spoke to Villafafia by telephone about the\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the state case against Epstein “and the next stage of the federal prosecution.”*°’ In\nhis 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, Edwards asserted that during this conversation,\nVillafafia did not inform him of the NPA, but that during the call, he sensed that the USAO “was\nbeginning to negotiate with Epstein concerning the federally identified crimes.” Houever, in an\nemail Villafafia sent after the call, she informed Sloman that during the call, Edwards stated that\n“his clients can name many more victims and wanted to knou if we can get out of the deal.”\nVillafafia told Sloman that after she told Edwards that the government was bound by the\nagreement, assuming Epstein completed it, Edwards asked that “if there is the slightest bit of\nhesitation on Epstein’s part of completing his performance, that he and his [three] clients be\nalloued to consult with [the USAO] before making a decision.”*°°\n\nThat same day, Edwards wrote a leter to Villafafia, complaining that Epstein’s state court\nsentence was “grossly inadequate for a predator of this magnitude” and urged Villafafia to “move\nforward with the traditional indictments and criminal prosecution commensurate with the crimes\nMr. Epstein has commited.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, Edwards filed his emergency petition in the U.S. District Court for the\nSouthern District of Florida on behalf of Courtney Wild, who was then identified only as “Jane\nDoe.” She was soon joined by a second petitioner, and they were respectively referred to as “Jane\nDoe l” and “Jane Doe 2.”3°? Edwards claimed that the government had violated his clients’ rights\nunder the CVRA by negotiating to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein without consulting\nwith the victims. The petition requested that the court order the United States to comply with the\nCVRA. The USAO opposed the petition, arguing that the CVRA did not apply because there were\n366 According to Villafafia’s handwriten notes from June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia left a message for two of the\natorneys.\n\n367 In his 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA case, Edwards recalled that his telephone conversation occurred on\nJune 3o, 2oo8, but noted that it could possibly have occurred on July 3, 2oo8.\n368 Sloman responded, “Thanks.”\n369 Later atempts by two additional victims to join the ongoing CVRA litigation were denied by the court.\n236\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23274", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023276.jpg": "l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and again listing the 32 “individuals whom the United States was prepared to\nname as victims of an enumerated offense.” 7”! The same day, Villafafia sent Goldberger a second\nleter, noting that the defense would receive copies of all victim notifications on a rolling basis.\n\nVillafafia informed her managers that the FBI case agents would reach out by telephone to\nthe listed victims who were unrepresented, to inform them that the case was resolved and to\nconfirm their addresses for notification by mail. With regard to the content of the telephone calls,\nVillafafia proposed the follouing language to the case agents:\n\nWe are calling to inform you about the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the Epstein\ninvestigation and to thank you for your help.\n\nMr. Epstein pled guilty to one child sex offense that will require him\nto register as a sex offender for life and received a sentence of l8\nmonths imprisonment folloued by one year of home confinement.\nMr. Epstein also made a concession regarding the payment of\nrestitution.\n\nAll of these terms are set out in a leter that AUSA Villafafia is going\nto send out.

(Provide names\nand phone numbers)\n\nAlso ask about counseling and let them knou that counseling is still\navailable even though the investigation is closed.\n\nOn July 2l, 2oo8, Villafafia sent the leter to the ll unrepresented victims whose addresses\nthe FBI had by that time confirmed. Villafafia provided Epstein’s defense counsel with a copy of\nthe leter sent to each victim, directly or though counsel (with the mailing addresses redacted).\n\nD. July — August 2oo8: The FBI Sends the Victim Notification Leter to Victims\n\nResiding Outside of the United States\n\nWhile atempting to locate and contact the unrepresented victims, the FBI obtained contact\ninformation for two victims residing outside of the United States. On July 23 and August 8, 2oo8,\nrespectively, the FBI Victim Specialist transmited an automated VNS form notification leter to\neach victim through the FBI representative at the U.S diplomatic mission for each country. This\na7 A month later, in an August l8, 2oo8 leter to the USAO, the defense sought to limit the government’s victim\nlist to those victims who were identified before the September 24, 2oo7 execution of the NPA. Villafafia also raised\nwith Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors the question whether the USAO had developed sufficient evidence to\ninclude new victims it had identified since creation of the July 2oo8 list and whether Jane Doe #2, who had previously\ngiven a statement in support of Epstein, should be added back to the list. Ultimately, Villafafia sent the defense a\nleter confirming that the government’s July lo, 2oo8 victim list was “the final list.”\n\n238\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23276", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023281.jpg": "leters to victims sent after the NPA was signed were not misleading in stating that the mater was\n“under investigation” because the government continued to investigate given its uncertainty that\nEpstein would plead guilty; and (3) Villafafia contacted the petitioners’ atorney prior to Epstein’s\nstate plea to advise him of the hearing. Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR that, while there were\nvalid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is\na case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required. I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [Vvictim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key conclusion that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> after development of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\nintention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\nconcluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”?°°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, “[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 Guidelines for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]uidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2328l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023295.jpg": "and consider victims’ views about, prospective plea negotiations.*”? The “prosecution stage”\nbegan when charges were filed and continued through all post-sentencing legal proceedings.*””\n\nAt the time the parties signed the NPA in September 2oo7, few courts had addressed victim\nstanding under the CVRA. Notably, district courts in New York and South Carolina had ruled that\nstanding atached only upon the filing of federal charges.*°’ Two cases relied upon by the court\nin its February 2ol9 opinion—Dean and its underlying district court opinion, BP Products—were\ndecided after the NPA was signed.\n\nThe CVRA litigation and proposed federal legislation—both pending as of the date of this\nReport—shou that the interpretation of victim standing under the CVRA continues to be a mater\nof debate.*!

The CVRA\nlitigation arising from the Epstein case shous the lack of clarity regarding when CVRA rights\napply: the district court concluded that CVRA rights applied pre-charge, but a sharply divided\npanel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals came to a contrary conclusion, a decision that has\nnou been vacated while the entire court hears the case en banc.\n\nBecause the Supreme Court had not addressed the issue of when CVRA rights apply, the\nlouer courts had reached divergent conclusions, and the Department had concluded that CVRA\nrights did not apply pre-charge, OPR concludes that the subjects’ failure to consult with victims\nbefore signing the NPA did not constitute professional misconduct because at that time, the CVRA\ndid not clearly and unambiguously require prosecutors to consult with victims before the filing of\nfederal criminal charges.*\n\n398 2oo5 Guidelines, Art.

In a\nSeptember 6, 2oo7 email primarily addressing other topics, as the plea negotiations were beginning\nin earnest and almost three weeks before the NPA was signed, Villafafia raised the topic of victim\nconsultation with Sloman: “The agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their\napproval, which as [CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law. . . .\n[A]nd the [PBPD] Chief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.”4\nSloman forwarded the email to Acosta with a note stating, “fyi.” Villafafia recalled that after she\nsent the email, Sloman told her by telephone, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.”*°° Villafafia also told\nOPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve been advised that . . . pre-\ncharge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Villafafia also recalled a discussion with\nAcosta, Menchel, and Sloman, during which she stated that she would need to get victims’ input\non the terms being proposed to the defense, and she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential.\nYou can’t disclose them.’4°6\n\nNone of the other subjects recalled a specific discussion before the NPA was signed about\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations. Menchel told OPR he believed the USAO was not required to\nconsult with victims during the preliminary “general discussion” phase of setlement negotiations;\nmoreover, he left the USAO before the terms of the NPA were fully developed.\n\nSloman told OPR that he “did not think that we had to consult with victims prior to entering\ninto the NPA” and “we did not have to seek approval from victims to resolve a case.” Sloman\nbelieved the USAO was obligated only to notify victims about <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of “the cases that we\nhandled, filed cases.” Sloman recalled that because the USAO envisioned a state court <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>\nof the mater, he did not “think that that was a concern of ours at the time to consult with [the\nvictims] prior to entering into ... the NPA.”\n\nLourie told OPR that he did not recall any discussions about informing the victims about\nthe terms of the NPA or any instructions to Villafafia that she not discuss the NPA with the victims.\nHe stated that everything the USAO did was “to try and get the best result as possible for the\nvictims. . . .

In addition, Villafafia’s reference to victim “approval” was inaccurate\nbecause the CVRA, even when applicable, requires only “consultation” with victims about prosecutorial decisions.\n\n5 Villafafia did not recall Sloman explaining the reason for the decision.\n\n4o6 Villafafia also told OPR that she recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations\ncould cause victims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.” Villafafia was\nuncertain of the date of the conversation, but Menchel’s presence requires it to have occurred before August 3, 2oo7.\n\n259\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23297", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023299.jpg": "require victim approval of the prosecutors’ plans, but it allous victims the opportunity to express\ntheir views and to be heard before a final decision is made.

LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\n\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*?\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim Specialist. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\n4o8 Villafafia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\nGuidelines, Art. IV, § B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners.

ACOSTA’S DECISION TO DEFER TO THE STATE ATTORNEY’S\nDISCRETION WHETHER TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT EPSTEIN’S STATE\nCOURT PLEA HEARING DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR OR UNAMBIGUOUS\nSTANDARD; HOWEVER, ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY\nFAILING TO ENSURE THAT VICTIMS IDENTIFIED IN THE FEDERAL\nINVESTIGATION WERE ADVISED OF THE STATE PLEA HEARING\nAs set forth in the factual discussion, within a few weeks of the NPA’s signing, it became\n\nclear that the defense team disagreed with, and strongly objected to, the government’s plan to\n\ninform victims of their ability to recover monetary damages from Epstein, under the l8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2255 provision of the NPA, and about Epstein’s state court plea hearing. The USAO initially\n\ntook the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA,\n\nincluding the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that\nvictims who wanted to atend could do so.\n\nIn November and December 2oo7, Epstein’s atorneys challenged the USAO’s position\nregarding victim notification. Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim\nnotifications. Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected\nto defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing\npursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights requirements. Acosta also determined that the USAO\nwould notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255,\na decision that was implemented by leters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.\nThis decision, which postponed notification of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas,\nwas based, at least in part, on Villafafia’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to\npreserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, belou.\n\nIn this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the responsibility for\nnotifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing. OPR concludes that neither the CVRA\nnor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore\nAcosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the discretion of the State\nAtorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing. Houever, OPR\nalso concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state\nintended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims\nforthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department. Through counsel, Acosta\n“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s conclusion and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard\n“never before expected of any U.S. Atorney.” OPR addresses Acosta’s criticisms in the\ndiscussion belou.\n\nA.

Let’s not assume. . . that the State Atorney’s office is full of bad actors.”\nSloman initially believed that “the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially\nbecause they had restitution rights under [§] 2255”; but his expectations changed after “there was\nan agreement made that we were going to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to\ndecide hou the victims were going to be notified.”4!’? Sloman told OPR he had been “proceeding\nunder the belief that we were going to notify the victims,” even though “this was not a federal\ncase,” but once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO “had concerns that if\nwe g[a]ve them the victim notification leter .. . and the deal fell apart, then the victims would be\ninstantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary compensation.”\n\nOPR could not determine whether the State Atorney’s Office notified any victims in\nadvance of the June 3o, 2oo8 state plea hearing. Krischer told OPR that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad a robust and effective victim notification process and staff, but he was not aware of whether\nor hou it was used in the Epstein case. Belohlavek told OPR that she could not recall whether\nvictims were notified of the hearing nor whether the state law required notification for the\naly Sloman stated in his June 3, 2oo8 leter to Deputy Atorney General Filip that Acosta made the decision\ntogether with the Department’s Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker. Acosta did consult\nwith Mandelker about the § 2255 civil damages recovery process, but neither Acosta nor Mandelker recalled\ndiscussing the issue of victim notification, and OPR found no other documentation indicating that Mandelker played\na role in the deferral decision.\n\n267\nDOJ-OGR-ooo233o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023306.jpg": "particular charges and victims at issue. Once the hearing was scheduled, Sloman told Villafafia to\ncontact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2oo8, she reported back\nto Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”*!® Villafafia recalled that she\nsent Reiter a list of the girls identified as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said\nhe would “contact as many as he could.” The contemporaneous records do not shou hou many\nor which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom. No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials. At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding. Accordingly, Villafafia, who was present in the courtroom for the\nhearing, had no knouledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims\nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.’”*!”\n\nOPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Atorney’s Office the\ndecision to notify victims of the scheduled date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional\nmisconduct. OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*”” Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(2)).7!\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*””\n\n4l8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\na9 Plea Hearing Transcript at 42.\n42o OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v.

This\ncontrast added to the victims’ perception that they had been treated unfairly, a view shared by the\npublic.\n\nNothing in the documentary record suggests that Acosta thought through the issue of\ndetermining which victims would be notified by the state, or that he took any steps to ensure that\nall of the knoun federal victims received information about the state plea hearing. Instead, as with\nhis decision to resolve the federal investigation through a state-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, Acosta exercised\npoor judgment when he made critical decisions affecting the federal investigation and the victims,\nbut also failed to consider the full consequences of those decisions or what was needed to\nimplement them. Acosta’s failure to consider these issues before simply leaving the responsibility\nfor making notifications entirely to the State Atorney’s discretion reflected poorly on the USAO\nand the Department as a whole. It left victims in the dark about an important proceeding that\nresolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had communicated with\nvictims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the Department intentionally\nsought to silence the victims by keeping them uninformed about the NPA and the resulting state\nproceeding. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were afforded an opportunity to atend a hearing\nthat was related to their oun cases and thus failed to ensure that victims were treated with\nforthrightness and dignity.\n\nV. VILLAFANA DID NOT COMMIT PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT IN HER\nORAL COMMUNICATIONS TO VICTIMS AND VICTIMS’ ATTORNEYS, IN\nWHICH SHE DESCRIBED THE CASE AS “UNDER INVESTIGATION” BUT DID\nNOT DISCLOSE THE EXISTENCE OF THE NPA TO SOME VICTIMS\nFrom September 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, until after Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\n\nstate court plea, the case agents, acting under Villafafia’s direction, directly informed only three\n\nvictims that the government had signed an NPA and that, if Epstein complied with its terms, the\nfederal investigation would be closed. During this time period, Villafafia and the case agents\ninteracted with several victims and their atorneys, and Villafafia contacted victims’ atorney\n\nBradley Edwards to encourage him to atend the state court plea hearing, but she did not inform\n\nvictims or Edwards of the NPA or the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal investigation.\n\nAs described in Part One of this chapter, after the NPA was signed, the FBI case agent and\nco-case agent began notifying victims about the NPA.“° After speaking to three victims, houever,\nthe FBI case agent became concerned that informing the victims about the NPA and the monetary\ndamages provision would create potential impeachment material for the victims and the agent\nshould Epstein breach the NPA and the case proceed to indictment and trial. As the case agent\ntold OPR, “I would . . . have to testify that I told every one of these girls that they could sue\nMr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think it was right.” The case\n43o Although Wild disputed that she was informed of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal case, the case agent’s email to\nVillafafia from this time period reflects that at least one victim understood that the federal case was resolved and that\nshe was unhappy with the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>.\n\n273\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023312.jpg": "agent and Villafafia consulted with the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer about the\nmater, and thereafter stopped notifying the victims about the NPA and their ability to pursue\nmonetary damages according to its terms.\n\nVillafafia advised Sloman by email of her concerns regarding the potential impeachment\nevidence, telling him, “One thing I am concerned about is that, if we [file charges] nou, cross-\nexamination will consist of- ‘and the government told you that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are\nentitled to a large amount of damages right?’” Explaining the decision in her later CVRA\ndeclaration, Villafafia said that after Epstein’s atorneys “complained that the victims were\nreceiving an incentive to overstate their involvement with Mr. Epstein in order to increase their\ndamages claims,” she “concluded that informing additional victims could compromise the\nwitnesses’ credibility at trial if Epstein reneged on the agreement.” Acosta was aware of these\nconcerns as he referred to them in an August 2oo8 email, “[W]e also believed that contacting the\nvictims would compromise them as potential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they\nwere doing this for the money, and we did not want to discuss liability with them, which was [a]\nkey part of [the] agree[ment].”\n\nThe case agents interviewed victims in October and November 2oo7, but did not inform\nthem about the NPA.**! On January 3l, 2oo8, the FBI agents, Villafafia, and the CEOS Trial\nAtorney interviewed three victims, including Courtney Wild, and they interviewed at least one\nmore victim the next day. Wild and two others had been contacted by the FBI in the fall of\n2oo7 and may have been informed about the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal investigation.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that during the January 3l, 2oo8 interviews, she did not specifically\ntell the victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had these terms.” She\nstated that she would not use “terminology” such as “NPA” because “most people don’t understand\nwhat that means.” Instead, with respect to the three victims who, according to Villafafia, had been\ninformed by the FBI about the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, she stated that “can agreement had been reached where\n[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look [like] he intends to actually\nperform . . . [and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged . . . and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled telling some victims that Epstein “was supposed to enter a plea in state court”\nthat would end the investigation, but she did not recall distinguishing between the “federal\ninvestigation versus a state investigation.” Villafafia told OPR she explained “the case was under\ninvestigation,” she and the agents “were preparing . . . again” to file charges, and they hoped “that\ncharges would be brought.” An email from Villafafia to Sloman and Acosta during this time period\nreflects that she had such discussions with at least one victim interviewed on this date: “The\nsecond girl... was very upset about the l8 month deal she had read about in the paper... .\n[S]he would rather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time in jail.” Villafafia,\nhouever, did not recall telling all of the victims interviewed at this time of the state plea; rather,\nshe likely only told those who knew about the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> from the FBI. In her oun 2ol5 CVRA-\ncase declaration, Wild stated that she “‘was not told about any [NPA] or any potential <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of\nFBI agents also interviewed victims in March and May of 2oo8, without prosecutors, and did not inform the\nvictims of the NPA.\n\n32 Two additional victims were scheduled to be interviewed on February l, 2oo8, but the evidence is unclear as\nto whether the interviews occurred.\n274\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233l2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023317.jpg": "and they often cannot fully reveal either the facts or the status of an investigation, even with\nvictims. The 2oo5 Guidelines advise that in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited\nin their disclosures: “Because victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government,\nand may disclose whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only nonsensitive data and\npublic information.”*°\n\nVillafafia’s concern about generating potential impeachment evidence by informing\nvictims of their potential to recover monetary damages from Epstein was not unreasonable.\nIndeed, the case agents initially raised the impeachment issue, and after considering the problem,\nVillafafia agreed with the agents’ concerns. Villafafia raised those concerns with the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer in October 2oo7 after the agents brought the issue to her\natention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom\nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound. OPR also considered that although\nVillafafia had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her\nsupervisor, the U.S. Atorney, had decided otherwise. When authorized to inform Edwards of the\nscheduled change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) atendance at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).“44 Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential conclusion of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\n48 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. lV, J B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim notification leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\n\n“44 The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of a sex abuse case. Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR-ooo233l7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023318.jpg": "intentionally concealing information from them and was part of a series of interactions with\nvictims that led to condemnation of the government’s treatment of victims. **°\nVI. THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO TREAT VICTIMS FORTHRIGHTLY AND\n\nWITH SENSITIVITY WHEN IT FAILED TO TIMELY PROVIDE VICTIMS\n\nWITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE <span class=\"highlight\">RESOLUTION</span> OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAlthough OPR does not conclude that any of the subjects commited professional\nmisconduct, either by failing to consult with the victims before the NPA was signed or in\ninteractions afterwards, OPR’s findings are not an endorsement of the government’s course of\naction. The government’s interactions with victims confused and frustrated many of the victims,\nparticularly the two CVRA petitioners and the two victims who had unsuccessfully atempted to\njoin in the CVRA litigation. As a result, the victims’ and the public’s perception of the mater is\nthat the prosecutors worked with Epstein’s atorneys to disenfranchise and silence the victims. It\nis unfortunate, and appears fundamentally unfair to the victims, that Acosta and Sloman (after\nMenchel and Lourie departed) took the unusual step of deciding to vet the USAO victim\nnotification leters with the defense after the NPA was signed, but failed to go beyond the\nrequirements of the CVRA or the 2oo5 Guidelines to consult with the victims before the NPA was\nsigned. This result is contrary to the Department’s intent, as set forth in the 2oo5 Guidelines, that\nDepartment employees work to “minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of crime\nendure in its wake.” When considering the entirety of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by\nthe Department.\n\nWild’s criticisms of the government’s conduct were based on interactions that are similar\nto and generally representative of the government’s interactions with other Epstein victims and\nthat demonstrate an overall lack of sensitivity to the victims by the government. Wild experienced\na series of confusing and inconsistent communications in her interactions with Villafafia and the\ncase agents. Wild received Villafafia’s leter in June 2oo7 stating inaccurately that she was a\nfederal victim entitled to CVRA rights. She was interviewed by the FBI in August 2oo7 but was\nnot told that a potential outcome was a state plea. Shortly after the September 24, 2oo7 signing of\nthe NPA, the FBI contacted her to inform her of the <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> of the federal case. Nonetheless,\non January lo, 2oo8, the FBI sent her a victims’ rights leter indicating that the case was under\ninvestigation and that some of her CVRA rights may not apply until after the defendant was\ncharged. On January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia re-interviewed Wild, along with a CEOS atorney and\nthe FBI agents, and told Wild that the case was under investigation, but did not specifically mention\nthe NPA, although she may have mentioned a possible <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. In mid-June 2oo8, when\nEdwards contacted Villafafia on Wild’s behalf, Villafafia informed him that the case was under\ninvestigation but did not mention the NPA. Just before Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8 state court plea,\n“45 OPR notes that, similar to Villafafia, Sloman interacted with a victim’s atorney during the time period\nbetween the signing of the NPA and Epstein’s state guilty plea. In January 2oo8, Sloman received a telephone call\nfrom his former law partner, who represented one of the victims and who asked Sloman whether the federal\ngovernment could bring charges against Epstein. Sloman, concerned about the potential for conflict of interest\nallegations due to his prior business relations with the atorney, refused to answer any questions regarding Epstein.\nBecause Sloman refused to provide any information, OPR found no basis for finding that Sloman misled the atorney.\n\n28o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023322.jpg": "OPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span> that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23322", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023323.jpg": "principles was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique <span class=\"highlight\">resolution</span>, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into\nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation\nwithout a federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department\ndid not interpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the\nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before\ncriminal charges were brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation\nwas for the purpose of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series\nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of\nthe government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is\ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims\nof a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\n285\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23323", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023760.jpg": "F.

As my clients case seems to lend itself to\nmisunderstandings and miscommunications by others, I thought it important to clarify some\nfacts assumed in error.\nI have spoken to Mr. Gaines at probation and he confirmed the follouing: Yes termination\nof supervision on a sex offender is unusual, houever a modification to probation from\nCommunity control is not uncommon when the probationer has been in compliance without\nviolation. In fact the department’s current policy on re-entry to the community dictates\nthat an offender be stepped doun as soon as possible. He was also under the\nmisimpression, as others might have been, that Epstein’s charges called for sex offender\nprobation. They do not, he is eligible for normal probation. As with many of the issues\nin my clients case, sterile questions that may have been asked tend to lead to answers\nthat though well meaning are not applicable.\nAs for the timeliness of the police reports of the atempted breakins, I wanted you to be\naware that I confirmed with Wackenhut that they called the police each time and spoke to\nthe captain on duty, there should be a record. I said to you it was my advice to the\nclient that he not file a formal report.\nl\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33l5l"};
