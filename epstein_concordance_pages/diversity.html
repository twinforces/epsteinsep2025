By choosing to seek an indictment in White Plains, the government chose a grand jury\nselection process guaranteed to draw from a pool that would underrepresent Black and Hispanic\njurors via-a-vis the Manhatan Counties and the Southern District. That choice constitutes\n“systematic exclusion,” and the third Duren prong is met.\n\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons set forth herein, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Indictment be\ndismissed.\nDated: March l5, 2o2l\nNew York, New York\nRespectfully submited,\n/s/ Christian R.
