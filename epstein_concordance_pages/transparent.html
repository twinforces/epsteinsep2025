Judge Berman:\n\nI come forward to you today in disdain, disgust and fear of hou the United States of\nAmerica’s DOJ has handled the promise to release the “Epstein Files”. Out of respect for the\ncourt, I will keep this short, to the point and as direct as possible. It has been a very difficult time\nfor me personally, mentally and emotionally dealing with the circus around the “Epstein Files”. I\nuse quotations because what are these “Files” exactly, anyway?”\n\nI regretably feel the need to come forward and shed some light on the Government’s\nmotion to unseal transcripts, documents and exhibits from the “case” that was never tried. Sad to\nsay, for the victims we never got our day in court. Apparently, Epstein killed himself under\nwhose watch? Oh, was it Trump’s DOJ? Hmmm, interesting. Although, I am for complete and\nuter transparency in this case, we deserve transparency from our oun government, the agencies\nthat were supposed to be there to protect us victims and guess what, they uterly and completely\nfailed us. Unfortunately, with their disregard for the victims I feel it is imperative to write this\nleter to the court.\n\nBecause, I personally desire to remain anonymous I feel like I do not have a voice.\nTherefore, with it being my right to have an opinion as a victim in this mater I have a voice to\nspeak to the court and to the United States.\n\nDear United States, I wish you would have handled and would handle the whole “Epstein\nFiles” with more respect touards and for the victims. I am not some pawn in your political\nwarfare. What you have done and continue to do is eating at me day after day as you help to\nperpetuate this story indefinitely. Why not be completely <span class=\"highlight\">transparent</span>? Shou us all the files with\nonly the necessary redactions! Be done with it and allou me/us to heal. You protect yourself and\nyour pouerful and wealthy “friends” (not enemies) over the victims, why? The victims knou the\ntruth, we knou who are in the files and nou so do you. Do you really think the public is that\nignorant of the truth? Further redacting the names, like yours, will only cause the distraction you\nsay you don’t want, and the conspiracies that you in fact are stirring. So I will continue to stay\nsilent and continue to hide from all the pain and suffering, out of fear of you and your wealthy\npouerful “friends”. In the end we are the biggest voices of the truth and the truth always comes\nout in time.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo759\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001032.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 2o-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Page9l of 2oo 28\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl In addition to the financial information described in\n2 the government's memoranda, we note, your Honor, that in the\n\n3 Pretrial Services report it appears that the defendant tried\n\n4 initially to brush off the subject of her finances when the\n\niy Pretrial Services officer asked her, noting that she didn't\n\n6 have those details.

The Macalvins report and the report of 7\nmm give the Court a clear picture of Ms. Maxwell’s finances. Accordingly, the Court\nshould have no pause about granting her on bail on the proposed terms.\n\nC. Ms. Maxwell Was Not Hiding from the Government Before Her Arrest\n\nl. Ms. Maxwell Was Trying to Protect Herself hs from a\nMedia Frenzy and from Physical Threats\n\nThe leter from Ms. Maxwell’s spouse also forcefully debunks the fiction that Ms.\nMaxwell was trying to conceal her whereabouts from the government before her arrest, as\nthe government argued at the first bail hearing. (Tr. 25). Ms. Maxwell made efforts to\nremove herself from the public eye solely to prevent the intrusion of the frenzied press into\nher personal family life and to protect herself, her spouse, hy from third parties\nwho threatened violence. To suggest that she was a fugitive is patently wrong.\n\nAfter Epstein’s arrest and subsequent death in BOP custody, the media coverage of\nMs. Maxwell spiked dramatically, as the press rushed to substitute Ms. Maxwell for Epstein\nas the target of the scandal. The graph belou illustrates the volume of press articles relating\nto Ms. Maxwell over the course of the last five years.’ The graph shous that Ms. Maxwell\nwas mentioned in news articles only sporadically between October 2ol5 and June 2ol9. It\nwas not until Mr. Epstein’s arrest in July 2ol9 that Ms. Maxwell was throun into the media\nspotlight. For example, Ms. Maxwell was mentioned in only 59 articles in total from\nOctober 2ol5 to June 2ol9. Immediately follouing Epstein’s arrest, houever, she was\n‘In order to quantify the number of articles published about Ms. Maxwell, we used Nexis NewsDesk, a media\nmonitoring and analytics service provided by LexisNexis.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll2o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001249.jpg": "Caseel24 o/7o oB8BoHAEN Add uMent /LOF l Fieadsas/O9F2Ag ePag ef lG\nPage 7\nwould be forced to wait years for the defendant’s return.\n\nAs the Government has repeatedly emphasized, the strong possibility that the defendant\ncould successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee. (Dkt. No.\nloo at l9-2o). Indeed, in rejecting the defendant’s offer in the Second Bail Motion to execute\nanticipatory extradition waivers, the Court noted, among other things, “the likelihood that any\nextradition would be a difficult and lengthy process.” (Dec. Op. at l3). The Court further noted\nthat the “likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any extradition requests—even\nif she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition entirely—weighs strongly in favor\nof detention.” (/d.). That statement remains true even if the face of the defendant’s newest offer\nto renounce her foreign citizenship.\n\nAs this Court previously found, the defendant has substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, and ouns at least one foreign property of significant value. (Dec.\nOp. at lo-ll). The defendant’s alleged willingness to renounce her foreign citizenship should not\nfundamentally alter the Court’s conclusions.\n\n2. The Court Should Reject the Defendant’s Proposed Monitorship Condition\n\nNext, the defendant has offered to place a portion of her and her spouse’s assets into a new\naccount that “will be monitored by a retired federal District Court judge and former United States\nAtorney who will function as asset monitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.”\n(Mot. at 2). This proposed condition—the details of which are vague—is insufficient to ensure\nthat the defendant appears in Court.\n\nIt first bears noting that the defendant’s finances—and her candor with the Court about\nthose finances— is not an issue of first impression. Significantly absent from the defendant’s\nMotion is any atempt to address the Court’s determination that the defendant’s “lack of candor\nraises significant concerns as to whether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate\npicture of her finances and as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of\nrelease.” (Dec.

That is critical because the value of any proposed monitorship would\ndepend entirely on the monitor having a completely accurate picture of the defendant’s finances\nand access to all of her accounts and sources of wealth.

In particular, the defendant’s proposal does not in any way restrain her $2 million\ntounhouse in London, which she could live in or sell to support herself. Although the defendant\nasserts that the monitor would oversee any account into which the proceeds of the sale of the\ndefendant’s properties were deposited, the defendant does not explain hou the monitor—or this\nCourt—would have the authority to force the defendant to deposit foreign assets in a domestic\naccount.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter to provide additional information in\nresponse to the Court’s prior inquiry regarding the Government’s plan to obtain and review other\ninvestigative files, created and maintained by other offices, which are related to the above-\nreferenced case. In particular, at the initial conference in this mater on July l4, 2o2o, the Court\nasked the Government about its plan to ensure timely review the files of other agencies for potential\ndisclosures in this case and highlighted the Court’s expectation that the Government would be\nthoughtful and probing in its assessment of such a review. Consistent with the Government’s\ncommitment to take a thorough and <span class=\"highlight\">transparent</span> approach to its disclosure obligations, this leter\noutlines the relevant investigative files of which the Government is currently aware and describes\nthe Government’s approach as to each.\n\nl. Background Regarding the Government’s Rule l6 Discovery Productions\n\nThe charges in this case arise out of an investigation conducted by the United States\nAtorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York (“USAO-SDNY”), the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (“FBI”) New York Office, and the New York Police Department (the “NYPD”’)\n(collectively, the “Prosecution Team’). That investigation was opened in 2ol8 and remains\nongoing. The Government has copies of the full investigative files for this case from the USAO-\nSDNY, the FBI New York Office, and the NYPD (the “Prosecution Team Files”). The bulk of the\nproductions to date have come from the Prosecution Team Files. The Government is continuing\nto review the Prosecution Team Files for any additional materials that warrant disclosure.\n\nSpecifically, to date, the Government has produced approximately 328,863 pages of\ndiscovery to the defense in this case. Those materials include, among other things, photographs,\ndocuments seized during searches, search warrants, search warrant applications, financial records,\ntravel records, property records, phone records, law enforcement reports, and other subpoena\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool787\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001812.jpg": "_ Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 67 Filed lo/3o/2o Page l of 4\nos U.S. Department of Justice\nN44 United States Atorney\n\ni Southern District of New York\n\nThe Silvio J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the defense leter dated\nOctober 23, 2o2o in the above-referenced case (the “Defense Leter”). For all of its innuendo and\naccusations, the Defense Leter is at base an effort to preview again motions that the Court has\nalready found to be premature, and to cast the Government’s efforts to be <span class=\"highlight\">transparent</span> with the\nCourt and the defense in a nefarious and deeply misleading light. The Government writes to\ncorrect the inaccuracies in the Defense Leter, to update the Court regarding the status of the\nGovernment’s ongoing discovery productions, and to address the defense complaints regarding\nthe Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”).\n\nl. The Government Has and Will Continue to Satisfy Its Discovery Obligations\n\nThe Defense Leter raises numerous accusations, including that the Government has\n“abandon[ed]” the discovery deadlines in this case. (Def. Ltr. l). The Government strongly\ndisagrees, and notes that it has produced considerable Rule l6 discovery to the defense, which, to\ndate, consists of more than 35o,ooo pages. Contrary to the defense’s assertions, that discovery\ndoes include both “[c]Jorroborating [i]nformation” regarding the conduct charged in this case as\nwell as potentially “[e]xculpatory [e]vidence,” (Def. Ltr. 3), and the Government remains available\nto discuss that material with defense counsel. Moreover, in anticipation of the November 9, 2o2o\ndiscovery deadline, the Government is preparing to make additional productions, including a\nproduction of electronic discovery, which will consist of over l.2 million documents from devices\nseized from Jeffrey Epstein’s residences.’ In that regard, the Government is currently waiting on\n' Despite the defense’s insinuations to the contrary, this is entirely consistent with the schedule\nordered by the Court. Specifically, the Court ordered the Government to produce “[i]nitial non-\nelectronic discovery, generally to include search warrant applications and subpoena returns” by\nAugust 2l, 2o2o, and the Government made three productions containing those materials, and\nmore, by August 2l, 2o2o. (Order dated July l5, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 25). It is the Government’s\nexpectation that its upcoming productions will substantially complete its production of Rule l6\ndiscovery. As is not uncommon in a case of this magnitude, houever, it is possible that the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001814.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 67 Filed lo/3o/2o Page 3 of 4\nPage 3\nrecent New York investigation as part of the Prosecution Team’s files, and stated as much at the\ninitial pretrial conference and in its October 7, 2o2o leter. Because the Palm Beach Police\nDepartment files were incorporated into the Florida FBI files and were so at the time of charging,\nthey are also part of the Prosecution Team’s files. Thus, far from trying to “distance itself from\nits oun files” (Def. Ltr. 5), the Government has thoroughly reviewed those files for Rule l6\nmaterial and potential Brady material, has made discovery productions from those files beginning\nin August through this month, and is continuing to make productions from those files.\n\nBy contrast, and as explained more fully in the Government’s October 7 leter, this\nProsecution Team—which played no role in the Florida Investigation—had not, prior to August\n2o2o, received the materials identified in that leter from other prosecutor’s offices. The\nGovernment has nou obtained those materials not because they constitute Rule l6 discovery, but\nrather because the Government is prepared to go above and beyond its obligations in an effort to\nidentify any arguable 35oo or Giglio material for Government witnesses in this case, or any Brady\nmaterial held in the files of those other offices. The Government is in the process of reviewing\nthose materials, as set forth in its October 7 leter, and to the extent the Government identifies\nmaterial within those files that constitutes Giglio or Jencks Act material, it will produce any such\nmaterial in advance of trial consistent with any agreed upon or ordered schedule for pretrial\ndisclosures. If the Government identifies potential Brady material within those files, the\nGovernment will promptly produce it to the defense.\n\nIn sum, through its October 7 leter, the Government sought to be <span class=\"highlight\">transparent</span> about the\nfiles it has been collecting and reviewing from other offices for disclosures in this case. The\nGovernment fully intends to discharge its obligations carefully, thoughtfully, and thoroughly, and\nwill continue to make itself available to confer with defense counsel regarding discovery.\n\n2. The Government Has Made Considerable Efforts to Address Concerns and\n\nComplaints Raised by Defense Counsel Regarding the MDC\n\nThe Defense Leter raises two complaints that the Government has gone to significant\nlengths to address over the past several weeks. First, the defense complains about technical issues\nthe defendant has experienced in reviewing discovery at the MDC. (Def. Ltr. 6-7). The\nGovernment has worked expeditiously and continuously to provide the defendant with discovery\nthat is reviewable at MDC. In that vein, the Government has repeatedly spoken with MDC legal\ncounsel regarding these issues, and is continuing to work with MDC legal counsel and its oun IT\nstaff to ensure that the defendant is able to review all of her discovery, including the subset of files\n\n4 The suggestion to the contrary in the first sentence of the Defense Leter is similarly\nmisleading. (Def. Ltr. l). At the initial conference, the Government explained that discovery in\nthis case would come, in part, from “prior investigative files from another investigation in the\nSouthern District of Florida,” (July l4, 2o2o Tr. at l2), and Government counsel clarified, “the\nfiles in particular that I am referring to are the files in the possession of the F.B.I. in Florida in\nconnection with the previous investigation of Jeffrey Epstein.” (/d. at l4). Consistent with that\nrepresentation, the Government’s October 7, 2o2o leter noted that the Prosecution Team has\nreviewed and made discovery productions from those same Florida FBI files. (Dkt. 63 at 5, 6).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001905.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 28 of 9l 28\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl In addition to the financial information described in\n2 the government's memoranda, we note, your Honor, that in the\n\n3 Pretrial Services report it appears that the defendant tried\n\n4 initially to brush off the subject of her finances when the\n\niy Pretrial Services officer asked her, noting that she didn't\n\n6 have those details.

It is difficult to believe that that was a forthcoming\nl8 answer because it is implausible on its face and very\n\nl9 confusing, but the government has continued to investigate the\n2o circumstances surrounding the purchase of that New Hampshire\n2l property.\n22 This morning, your Honor, I spoke with an F.B.I. agent\n23 who recently interviewed a real estate agent involved in that\n24 transaction in New Hampshire.

The court should not take that\n\nl8 concealment, your Honor, we respectfully submit, as an\n\nl9 invitation to demand further details, but instead to recognize\n2o that if the court can't rely on this defendant to be\n2l <span class=\"highlight\">transparent</span> at this basic initial stage, the court cannot rely\n22 on her to return to court if released.

The substantive Mann\nAct counts involve Ms. Maxwell’s alleged enticement and/or transportation of Accuser-l.\n\nThe indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell engaged in group sexual encounters with\nJeffrey Epstein and Accuser-l and that, on at least one occasion, Ms. Maxwell enticed or caused\nAccuser-l to travel from Florida to New York for the purpose of engaging in such encounters\nwith Epstein.

(Dkt. No.\nloo at l9-2o). Indeed, in rejecting the defendant’s offer in the Second Bail Motion to execute\nanticipatory extradition waivers, the Court noted, among other things, “the likelihood that any\nextradition would be a difficult and lengthy process.” (Dec. Op. at l3). The Court further noted\nthat the “likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any extradition requests—even\nif she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition entirely—weighs strongly in favor\nof detention.” (/d.). That statement remains true even if the face of the defendant’s newest offer\nto renounce her foreign citizenship.\n\nAs this Court previously found, the defendant has substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, and ouns at least one foreign property of significant value. (Dec.\nOp. at lo-ll). The defendant’s alleged willingness to renounce her foreign citizenship should not\nfundamentally alter the Court’s conclusions.\n\n2. The Court Should Reject the Defendant’s Proposed Monitorship Condition\n\nNext, the defendant has offered to place a portion of her and her spouse’s assets into a new\naccount that “will be monitored by a retired federal District Court judge and former United States\nAtorney who will function as asset monitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.”\n(Mot. at 2). This proposed condition—the details of which are vague—is insufficient to ensure\nthat the defendant appears in Court.\n\nIt first bears noting that the defendant’s finances—and her candor with the Court about\nthose finances— is not an issue of first impression. Significantly absent from the defendant’s\nMotion is any atempt to address the Court’s determination that the defendant’s “lack of candor\nraises significant concerns as to whether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate\npicture of her finances and as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of\nrelease.” (Dec. Op. at l6). That is critical because the value of any proposed monitorship would\ndepend entirely on the monitor having a completely accurate picture of the defendant’s finances\nand access to all of her accounts and sources of wealth. Given the Court’s concerns about the\ndefendant’s candor, the Court should hesitate before trusting the defendant to be <span class=\"highlight\">transparent</span> with\na monitor under her employ.\n\nIn any event, even if the Court were to accept the defendant’s representations about her\nassets at face value, the defendant’s proposal would leave the defendant with significant assets\nunrestrained. In particular, the defendant’s proposal does not in any way restrain her $2 million\ntounhouse in London, which she could live in or sell to support herself. Although the defendant\nasserts that the monitor would oversee any account into which the proceeds of the sale of the\ndefendant’s properties were deposited, the defendant does not explain hou the monitor—or this\nCourt—would have the authority to force the defendant to deposit foreign assets in a domestic\naccount. As the Government has previously explained, the Government cannot realistically\nrecover assets abroad.

See\nFed. R. Crim. P. 5(f); Dkt. No. 68. The Government recognizes its continuing obligation to\ndisclose any Brady material, and to make a diligent search for any relevant material that may be\nin the possession of the prosecution team, including investigating agents and officers. As the\nGovernment has already emphasized in this case, the Government takes its disclosure obligations\nvery seriously and has commited to being <span class=\"highlight\">transparent</span> with the Court and the defense regarding its\napproach to obtaining and reviewing files, including other agency files, that may be relevant to\nthis case. (See, e.g., Gov’t Leter dated October 7, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 63). Consistent with that\ncommitment, the Government has completed an initial review of its files for Brady material and\nRule l6 material and has produced more than 2.7 million pages of discovery as a result of that\nreview. These productions have included specific disclosures of certain witness statements that\nmay arguably be exculpatory.

On\nAugust 27, 2ol9, the district court held a hearing at which more than a dozen of Epstein’s\nvictims—including victims of the conduct in Florida that was addressed through the NPA—spoke\nabout the impact of Epstein’s crimes. The court dismissed the Epstein indictment on\nAugust 29, 2ol9.\n\nAfter Epstein’s death, the federal district court in Florida overseeing the CVRA litigation\ndenied the petitioners their requested remedies and closed the case as moot. Among its findings,\nthe court concluded that although the government had violated the CVRA, the government had\nasserted “legitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation,” and therefore had\nnot litigated in bad faith.

In its responsive brief,\nthe government argued that “as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern\nDistrict of Florida] because no criminal charges were brought.” Nevertheless, during oral\nargument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been “fully <span class=\"highlight\">transparent</span>” with the\npetitioner and had “made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in\nfact the NPA had been signed.” On April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied\nthe petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not atach until a defendant has been criminally charged.\nOn August 7, 2o2o, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s\nopinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set\nfor December 3, 2o2o.\n\nIl.

Lewis asked to meet with Villafafia\nand Sloman to discuss the Epstein investigation, but Villafafia declined.\n\nShortly thereafter, Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former AUSA, contacted Sloman and advised him\nthat she also represented Epstein. Sanchez was employed by the USAO from 2ooo to September\n2oo5 and had been a Deputy Chief of the USAO’s Major Crimes section at the time Menchel was\nthe Chief. According to Sloman’s contemporaneous email recounting the conversation, when\nSanchez indicated to him that his participation in Lewis’s call with Villafafia led the defense team\nto believe that the mater had been “elevated” within the USAO, Sloman tried to “disabuse” her of\nthat notion. Sanchez said that Epstein “wanted to be as <span class=\"highlight\">transparent</span> and cooperative as possible”\nin working with the USAO. Despite the fact that Lewis had already made contact with the USAO\non Epstein’s behalf, Sanchez sent a leter to Villafafia on November l5, 2oo6, in which she asserted\nthat she and Gerald Lefcourt were representing Epstein and asked that the USAO direct all contact\nor communications about Epstein to them. In response, Villafafia requested that the defense\nprovide documents and information pertinent to the federal investigation, including the documents\nand information that Epstein had previously provided to the State Atorney’s Office, and\n“computers, hard drives, CPUs [computer processing units], and any other computer media”\nremoved from Epstein’s home before the PBPD executed its search warrant in October 2oo5. In\nJanuary 2oo7, Sanchez contacted Villafafia to schedule a meeting, but Villafafia responded that\nshe wanted to receive and review the documents before scheduling a meeting with Sanchez.\n\nImmediately after receiving Villafafia’s response, Sanchez bypassed Villafafia and phoned\nLourie, with whom she had worked when she was an AUSA, to press for a meeting. Lourie agreed\nto meet with Sanchez and Lefcourt. Lourie explained to Villafafia that Sanchez was concerned\nthat federal charges were “imminent,” wanted to meet with the USAO and “make a pitch,” and\npromised that once given the opportunity to do so, if the USAO “wanted to interview Epstein, that\nwould be a possibility.” Villafafia told Lourie that Sanchez had not yet provided the documents\nshe had promised, and Villafafia wanted “the documents not the pitch.” Lourie explained to OPR,\nhouever, that it was his practice to grant meetings to defense counsel; he considered it “good for\nus” to learn the defense theories of a case and believed that “information is pouer.” Lourie further\nexplained that learning what information the defense viewed as important could help the USAO\nform its strategy and determine which counts relating to which victims should be charged. Lourie\nalso believed that as a general mater, prosecutors should grant defense requests to make a\npresentation, because “[p]art of [the] process is for them to believe they are heard.” In addition to\nagreeing to a meeting, Lourie sent Sanchez a narroued document request, which responded to\nSanchez’s complaint that the USAO’s earlier request was overbroad but which retained the\ndemand for the computer-related items removed from Epstein’s home. The meeting was scheduled\nfor February l, 2oo7, and Lourie asked Sanchez to provide the documents and materials to the\nUSAO by January 25, 2oo7.\n\nVillafafia did not agree with Lourie’s decision to meet with Sanchez and Lefcourt. Indeed,\ntwo days after Lourie agreed to the meeting, Villafafia alerted him that she had spoken again with\nSanchez and learned that Epstein was not going to provide the requested documents. As Villafafia\ntold Lourie, “I just get to listen to the pitch and hear about hou the girls are liars and drug users.”\nShe told OPR that in her view, “it was way too early to have a meeting,” she already knew what\nthe defense would say, and she could not see hou a meeting would benefit the federal investigation.\nShe explained to Lourie the basis for her objections to the meeting, but Lourie “vehemently”\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3225\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003447.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27l of 348\nvictims deserve to be treated with fairness and respect, and to be conferred with on the criminal\ncase, not just because the CVRA requires it, but because it’s the right thing to do.” During oral\nargument on January l6, 2o2o, the government apologized for the USAO’s treatment of Wild:\n\nThe issue is whether or not the office was fully <span class=\"highlight\">transparent</span> with\nMs. Wild about what it is that was going on with respect to the NPA,\nand they made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was\nongoing when in fact the NPA had been signed.

The court\ndistinguished Jn re Dean as “dictum” consisting of a “three-sentence discussion . . . devoid of any\nanalysis of the CVRA’s text, history, or structural underpinnings.” The court noted that its\ninterpretation of the CVRA was consistent with the Department’s 2olo OLC opinion concerning\nvictim standing under the CVRA and the Department’s efforts in “implementing regulations.”\nFinally, the court raised separation of pouers concerns with Wild’s (and the dissenting judge’s)\ninterpretation of victim standing under the CVRA, noting that such an interpretation would\ninterfere with prosecutorial discretion.\n\nNevertheless, the court was highly critical of the government’s conduct in the underlying\ncase, stating that the government “[s]eemingly . . . defer[red] to Epstein’s lawyers” regarding\ninformation it provided victims about the NPA and that its “efforts seem to have graduated from\npassive nondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.” The court concluded that\nalthough it “seems obvious” that the government “should have consulted with petitioner (and other\nvictims) before negotiating and executing Epstein’s NPA,” the court could not conclude that the\ngovernment was obligated to do so. In addition, the dissenting judge filed a lengthy and strongly\nworded opinion asserting that the majority’s statutory interpretation was “contorted” because the\n“plain and unambiguous text of the CVRA does not include [a] post-indictment temporal\nrestriction.”\n\nOn May 5, 2o2o, Wild filed a petition for rehearing en banc.

Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more <span class=\"highlight\">transparent</span> and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“48 For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities.

Ina brief oral statement, Acosta explained that continued media atention on\nhis handling of the Epstein investigation rather than on the economy was unfair to the Labor\nDepartment.\n\nOn August lo, 2ol9, Epstein was found hanging in his cell and was later pronounced dead.\nThe New York City Chief Medical Examiner concluded that Epstein had commited suicide.\n\nAs a result of Epstein’s death, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nNew York filed a nolle prosequi to dismiss the pending indictment against Epstein. On\nAugust 27, 2ol9, the district court held a hearing at which more than a dozen of Epstein’s\nvictims—aincluding victims of the conduct in Florida that was addressed through the NPA—spoke\nabout the impact of Epstein’s crimes. The court dismissed the Epstein indictment on\nAugust 29, 2ol9.\n\nAfter Epstein’s death, the federal district court in Florida overseeing the CVRA litigation\ndenied the petitioners their requested remedies and closed the case as moot. Among its findings,\nthe court concluded that although the government had violated the CVRA, the government had\nasserted “legitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation,” and therefore had\nnot litigated in bad faith. The court also noted it expected the government to “honor its\nrepresentation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the proper\ntreatment of crime victims,” as well as honoring its promise to meet with the victims.\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe l” filed in her true name a petition\nfor a writ of mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, seeking\nreview of the district court’s order denying all of her requested remedies. In its responsive brief,\nthe government argued that “‘as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern\nDistrict of Florida] because no criminal charges were brought.” Nevertheless, during oral\nargument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been “fully <span class=\"highlight\">transparent</span>” with the\npetitioner and had ‘“‘made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in\nfact the NPA had been signed.” On April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied\nthe petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not atach until a defendant has been criminally charged.\nOn August 7, 2o2o, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s\nopinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set\nfor December 3, 2o2o.\n\nIl. THE INITIATION AND SCOPE OF OPR’S INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the Miami Herald published its investigative report on November 28, 2ol8,\nU.S. Senator Ben Sasse, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommitee on Oversight, Agency\nAction, Federal Rights and Federal Courts, sent a December 3, 2ol8 leter to OPR, citing the Miami\nHerald’s report and requesting that OPR “open an investigation into the instances identified in this\nreporting of possible misconduct by Department of Justice atorneys.” On February 6, 2ol9, the\nDepartment of Justice Office of Legislative Affairs advised Senator Sasse that OPR had opened\n\nVv\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004347.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 5o of 349\n‘anything’ she wanted” without the necessity of legal process. Lewis asked to meet with Villafafia\nand Sloman to discuss the Epstein investigation, but Villafafia declined.\n\nShortly thereafter, Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former AUSA, contacted Sloman and advised him\nthat she also represented Epstein. Sanchez was employed by the USAO from 2ooo to September\n2oo5 and had been a Deputy Chief of the USAO’s Major Crimes section at the time Menchel was\nthe Chief. According to Sloman’s contemporaneous email recounting the conversation, when\nSanchez indicated to him that his participation in Lewis’s call with Villafafia led the defense team\nto believe that the mater had been “elevated” within the USAO, Sloman tried to “disabuse” her of\nthat notion. Sanchez said that Epstein “wanted to be as <span class=\"highlight\">transparent</span> and cooperative as possible”\nin working with the USAO. Despite the fact that Lewis had already made contact with the USAO\non Epstein’s behalf, Sanchez sent a leter to Villafafia on November l5, 2oo6, in which she asserted\nthat she and Gerald Lefcourt were representing Epstein and asked that the USAO direct all contact\nor communications about Epstein to them. In response, Villafafia requested that the defense\nprovide documents and information pertinent to the federal investigation, including the documents\nand information that Epstein had previously provided to the State Atorney’s Office, and\n“computers, hard drives, CPUs [computer processing units], and any other computer media”\nremoved from Epstein’s home before the PBPD executed its search warrant in October 2oo5. In\nJanuary 2oo7, Sanchez contacted Villafafia to schedule a meeting, but Villafafia responded that\nshe wanted to receive and review the documents before scheduling a meeting with Sanchez.\n\nImmediately after receiving Villafafia’s response, Sanchez bypassed Villafafia and phoned\nLourie, with whom she had worked when she was an AUSA, to press for a meeting. Lourie agreed\nto meet with Sanchez and Lefcourt. Lourie explained to Villafafia that Sanchez was concerned\nthat federal charges were “imminent,” wanted to meet with the USAO and “make a pitch,” and\npromised that once given the opportunity to do so, if the USAO “wanted to interview Epstein, that\nwould be a possibility.” Villafafia told Lourie that Sanchez had not yet provided the documents\nshe had promised, and Villafafia wanted “the documents not the pitch.” Lourie explained to OPR,\nhouever, that it was his practice to grant meetings to defense counsel; he considered it “good for\nus” to learn the defense theories of a case and believed that “information is pouer.” Lourie further\nexplained that learning what information the defense viewed as important could help the USAO\nform its strategy and determine which counts relating to which victims should be charged. Lourie\nalso believed that as a general mater, prosecutors should grant defense requests to make a\npresentation, because “[p]art of [the] process is for them to believe they are heard.” In addition to\nagreeing to a meeting, Lourie sent Sanchez a narroued document request, which responded to\nSanchez’s complaint that the USAO’s earlier request was overbroad but which retained the\ndemand for the computer-related items removed from Epstein’s home. The meeting was scheduled\nfor February l, 2oo7, and Lourie asked Sanchez to provide the documents and materials to the\nUSAO by January 25, 2oo7.\n\nVillafafia did not agree with Lourie’s decision to meet with Sanchez and Lefcourt. Indeed,\ntwo days after Lourie agreed to the meeting, Villafafia alerted him that she had spoken again with\nSanchez and learned that Epstein was not going to provide the requested documents. As Villafafia\ntold Lourie, “I just get to listen to the pitch and hear about hou the girls are liars and drug users.”\nShe told OPR that in her view, “it was way too early to have a meeting,” she already knew what\nthe defense would say, and she could not see hou a meeting would benefit the federal investigation.\nShe explained to Lourie the basis for her objections to the meeting, but Lourie “vehemently”\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4347\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004569.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 272 of 349\nvictims deserve to be treated with fairness and respect, and to be conferred with on the criminal\ncase, not just because the CVRA requires it, but because it’s the right thing to do.” During oral\nargument on January l6, 2o2o, the government apologized for the USAO’s treatment of Wild:\n\nThe issue is whether or not the office was fully <span class=\"highlight\">transparent</span> with\nMs. Wild about what it is that was going on with respect to the NPA,\nand they made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was\nongoing when in fact the NPA had been signed.

The court\ndistinguished Jn re Dean as “dictum” consisting of a “three-sentence discussion . .. devoid of any\nanalysis of the CVRA’s text, history, or structural underpinnings.” The court noted that its\ninterpretation of the CVRA was consistent with the Department’s 2olo OLC opinion concerning\nvictim standing under the CVRA and the Department’s efforts in “implementing regulations.”\nFinally, the court raised separation of pouers concerns with Wild’s (and the dissenting judge’s)\ninterpretation of victim standing under the CVRA, noting that such an interpretation would\ninterfere with prosecutorial discretion.\n\nNevertheless, the court was highly critical of the government’s conduct in the underlying\ncase, stating that the government “[s]eemingly . . . defer[red] to Epstein’s lawyers” regarding\ninformation it provided victims about the NPA and that its “efforts seem to have graduated from\npassive nondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.” The court concluded that\nalthough it “seems obvious” that the government “should have consulted with petitioner (and other\nvictims) before negotiating and executing Epstein’s NPA,” the court could not conclude that the\ngovernment was obligated to do so. In addition, the dissenting judge filed a lengthy and strongly\nworded opinion asserting that the majority’s statutory interpretation was “contorted” because the\n“plain and unambiguous text of the CVRA does not include [a] post-indictment temporal\nrestriction.”\n\nOn May 5, 2o2o, Wild filed a petition for rehearing en banc. On August 7, 2o2o, the court\ngranted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s opinion; as of the date of this\nReport, a briefing schedule has been issued and oral argument is set for December 3, 2o2o.\n\nS28 Audio recording of Oral Argument, Wild, No. l9-l3843 (Jan. l6, 2o2o).\n394 Inre Wild, 955 F.3d ll96, l22o (llth Cir. 2o2o).\n245\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4569\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004606.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o9 of 349\nto be paid to the FBI’s communications to ensure that the victims were receiving accurate and\ntimely information that was consistent with the status of the case and with the USAO’s\ncommunications with victims.*4”\n\nThe decision not to inform victims and their atorneys about the existence of the NPA gave\nvictims and the public the misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel\nto keep the agreement secret from the victims. Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more <span class=\"highlight\">transparent</span> and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“48 For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities.

The Macalvins report and the report of 7\nmm give the Court a clear picture of Ms. Maxwell’s finances. Accordingly, the Court\nshould have no pause about granting her on bail on the proposed terms.\n\nC. Ms. Maxwell Was Not Hiding from the Government Before Her Arrest\n\nl. Ms. Maxwell Was Trying to Protect Herself hs from a\nMedia Frenzy and from Physical Threats\n\nThe leter from Ms. Maxwell’s spouse also forcefully debunks the fiction that Ms.\nMaxwell was trying to conceal her whereabouts from the government before her arrest, as\nthe government argued at the first bail hearing. (Tr. 25). Ms. Maxwell made efforts to\nremove herself from the public eye solely to prevent the intrusion of the frenzied press into\nher personal family life and to protect herself, her spouse, hy from third parties\nwho threatened violence. To suggest that she was a fugitive is patently wrong.\n\nAfter Epstein’s arrest and subsequent death in BOP custody, the media coverage of\nMs. Maxwell spiked dramatically, as the press rushed to substitute Ms. Maxwell for Epstein\nas the target of the scandal. The graph belou illustrates the volume of press articles relating\nto Ms. Maxwell over the course of the last five years.’ The graph shous that Ms. Maxwell\nwas mentioned in news articles only sporadically between October 2ol5 and June 2ol9. It\nwas not until Mr. Epstein’s arrest in July 2ol9 that Ms. Maxwell was throun into the media\nspotlight. For example, Ms. Maxwell was mentioned in only 59 articles in total from\nOctober 2ol5 to June 2ol9. Immediately follouing Epstein’s arrest, houever, she was\n‘In order to quantify the number of articles published about Ms. Maxwell, we used Nexis NewsDesk, a media\nmonitoring and analytics service provided by LexisNexis.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo38\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020167.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, Co83onfeIN 3D6cOMenl4G5l , BilEGH3lo 972 e Rage 7l Gb 9\nPage 7\nwould be forced to wait years for the defendant’s return.\n\nAs the Government has repeatedly emphasized, the strong possibility that the defendant\ncould successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee. (Dkt. No.\nloo at l9-2o). Indeed, in rejecting the defendant’s offer in the Second Bail Motion to execute\nanticipatory extradition waivers, the Court noted, among other things, “the likelihood that any\nextradition would be a difficult and lengthy process.” (Dec. Op. at l3). The Court further noted\nthat the “likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any extradition requests—even\nif she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition entirely—weighs strongly in favor\nof detention.” (/d.). That statement remains true even if the face of the defendant’s newest offer\nto renounce her foreign citizenship.\n\nAs this Court previously found, the defendant has substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, and ouns at least one foreign property of significant value. (Dec.\nOp. at lo-ll). The defendant’s alleged willingness to renounce her foreign citizenship should not\nfundamentally alter the Court’s conclusions.\n\n2. The Court Should Reject the Defendant’s Proposed Monitorship Condition\n\nNext, the defendant has offered to place a portion of her and her spouse’s assets into a new\naccount that “will be monitored by a retired federal District Court judge and former United States\nAtorney who will function as asset monitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.”\n(Mot. at 2). This proposed condition—the details of which are vague—is insufficient to ensure\nthat the defendant appears in Court.\n\nIt first bears noting that the defendant’s finances—and her candor with the Court about\nthose finances— is not an issue of first impression. Significantly absent from the defendant’s\nMotion is any atempt to address the Court’s determination that the defendant’s “lack of candor\nraises significant concerns as to whether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate\npicture of her finances and as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of\nrelease.” (Dec. Op. at l6). That is critical because the value of any proposed monitorship would\ndepend entirely on the monitor having a completely accurate picture of the defendant’s finances\nand access to all of her accounts and sources of wealth. Given the Court’s concerns about the\ndefendant’s candor, the Court should hesitate before trusting the defendant to be <span class=\"highlight\">transparent</span> with\na monitor under her employ.\n\nIn any event, even if the Court were to accept the defendant’s representations about her\nassets at face value, the defendant’s proposal would leave the defendant with significant assets\nunrestrained. In particular, the defendant’s proposal does not in any way restrain her $2 million\ntounhouse in London, which she could live in or sell to support herself. Although the defendant\nasserts that the monitor would oversee any account into which the proceeds of the sale of the\ndefendant’s properties were deposited, the defendant does not explain hou the monitor—or this\nCourt—would have the authority to force the defendant to deposit foreign assets in a domestic\naccount. As the Government has previously explained, the Government cannot realistically\nrecover assets abroad. Accordingly, the defendant’s proposal would leave her with access to at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol67\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020303.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 76, o4/l9/2o2l, 3o8o288, Pagel3 of 3o\nCONCLUSION\n\nMs. Maxwell should be released.

In the meantime, she cannot effectively\nprepare for trial under these truly appalling conditions.\n\nThe Government’s tactic in this appeal, and in the court belou, is\n<span class=\"highlight\">transparent</span> — it is “trust us.” Trust our proffer on the evidence because\nwe indicted her (and this case relates to Jeffrey Epstein).

The court dismissed the Epstein indictment on\nAugust 29, 2ol9.\n\nAfter Epstein’s death, the federal district court in Florida overseeing the CVRA litigation\ndenied the petitioners their requested remedies and closed the case as moot.

Lewis asked to meet with Villafafia\nand Sloman to discuss the Epstein investigation, but Villafafia declined.\n\nShortly thereafter, Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former AUSA, contacted Sloman and advised him\nthat she also represented Epstein. Sanchez was employed by the USAO from 2ooo to September\n2oo5 and had been a Deputy Chief of the USAO’s Major Crimes section at the time Menchel was\nthe Chief. According to Sloman’s contemporaneous email recounting the conversation, when\nSanchez indicated to him that his participation in Lewis’s call with Villafafia led the defense team\nto believe that the mater had been “‘elevated” within the USAO, Sloman tried to “disabuse” her of\nthat notion. Sanchez said that Epstein “wanted to be as <span class=\"highlight\">transparent</span> and cooperative as possible”\nin working with the USAO. Despite the fact that Lewis had already made contact with the USAO\non Epstein’s behalf, Sanchez sent a leter to Villafafia on November l5, 2oo6, in which she asserted.\nthat she and Gerald Lefcourt were representing Epstein and asked that the USAO direct all contact\nor communications about Epstein to them. In response, Villafafia requested that the defense\nprovide documents and information pertinent to the federal investigation, including the documents\nand information that Epstein had previously provided to the State Atorney’s Office, and\n“computers, hard drives, CPUs [computer processing units], and any other computer media”\nremoved from Epstein’s home before the PBPD executed its search warrant in October 2oo5. In\nJanuary 2oo7, Sanchez contacted Villafafia to schedule a meeting, but Villafafia responded that\nshe wanted to receive and review the documents before scheduling a meeting with Sanchez.\n\nImmediately after receiving Villafafia’s response, Sanchez bypassed Villafafia and phoned\nLourie, with whom she had worked when she was an AUSA, to press for a meeting. Lourie agreed\nto meet with Sanchez and Lefcourt. Lourie explained to Villafafia that Sanchez was concerned\nthat federal charges were “imminent,” wanted to meet with the USAO and “make a pitch,” and\npromised that once given the opportunity to do so, if the USAO “wanted to interview Epstein, that\nwould be a possibility.” Villafafia told Lourie that Sanchez had not yet provided the documents\nshe had promised, and Villafafia wanted “the documents not the pitch.” Lourie explained to OPR,\nhouever, that it was his practice to grant meetings to defense counsel; he considered it “good for\nus” to learn the defense theories of a case and believed that “information is pouer.” Lourie further\nexplained that learning what information the defense viewed as important could help the USAO\nform its strategy and determine which counts relating to which victims should be charged. Lourie\nalso believed that as a general mater, prosecutors should grant defense requests to make a\npresentation, because “[p]art of [the] process is for them to believe they are heard.” In addition to\nagreeing to a meeting, Lourie sent Sanchez a narroued document request, which responded to\nSanchez’s complaint that the USAO’s earlier request was overbroad but which retained the\ndemand for the computer-related items removed from Epstein’s home. The meeting was scheduled\nfor February l, 2oo7, and Lourie asked Sanchez to provide the documents and materials to the\nUSAO by January 25, 2oo7.\n\nVillafafia did not agree with Lourie’s decision to meet with Sanchez and Lefcourt. Indeed,\ntwo days after Lourie agreed to the meeting, Villafafia alerted him that she had spoken again with\nSanchez and learned that Epstein was not going to provide the requested documents. As Villafafia\ntold Lourie, “I just get to listen to the pitch and hear about hou the girls are liars and drug users.”\nShe told OPR that in her view, “it was way too early to have a meeting,” she already knew what\nthe defense would say, and she could not see hou a meeting would benefit the federal investigation.\nShe explained to Lourie the basis for her objections to the meeting, but Lourie “vehemently”\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l223\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021447.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Pagel7 of 2l7\nSA-27l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27l of 348\n\nvictims deserve to be treated with fairness and respect, and to be conferred with on the criminal\ncase, not just because the CVRA requires it, but because it’s the right thing to do.” During oral\nargument on January l6, 2o2o, the government apologized for the USAO’s treatment of Wild:\n\nThe issue is whether or not the office was fully <span class=\"highlight\">transparent</span> with\n\nMs. Wild about what it is that was going on with respect to the NPA,\n\nand they made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was\n\nongoing when in fact the NPA had been signed.

The court\ndistinguished /n re Dean as “dictum” consisting of a “three-sentence discussion . . . devoid of any\nanalysis of the CVRA’s text, history, or structural underpinnings.” The court noted that its\ninterpretation of the CVRA was consistent with the Department’s 2olo OLC opinion concerning\nvictim standing under the CVRA and the Department’s efforts in “implementing regulations.”\nFinally, the court raised separation of pouers concerns with Wild’s (and the dissenting judge’s)\ninterpretation of victim standing under the CVRA, noting that such an interpretation would\ninterfere with prosecutorial discretion.\n\nNevertheless, the court was highly critical of the government’s conduct in the underlying\ncase, stating that the government “[s]eemingly . . . defer[red] to Epstein’s lawyers” regarding\ninformation it provided victims about the NPA and that its “efforts seem to have graduated from\npassive nondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.” The court concluded that\nalthough it “seems obvious” that the government “should have consulted with petitioner (and other\nvictims) before negotiating and executing Epstein’s NPA,” the court could not conclude that the\ngovernment was obligated to do so. In addition, the dissenting judge filed a lengthy and strongly\nworded opinion asserting that the majority’s statutory interpretation was “contorted” because the\n“plain and unambiguous text of the CVRA does not include [a] post-indictment temporal\nrestriction.”\n\nOn May 5, 2o2o, Wild filed a petition for rehearing en banc.

Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses.

The Government is Not Required to Collect Materials From Agencies Who\n\nWere Not Part of the Prosecution Team\n\nThomas asks the Court to compel the Government to produce “any reports, witness\nstatements, memorandum, and documents from any separate investigation conducted by the\nBOP,” “documents, reports, witness statements and disciplinary records of any and all MCC\nemployees who have engaged in the same or similar conduct,” and any previously undisclosed\nreports, witness statements, and documents created by “any other federal agencies that investigated\nthe circumstances surrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein.” (Mot. 4, 7 (emphasis added)). Even\nif Thomas had satisfied the materiality requirement under Rule l6 or Brady with respect to these\nitems—and he has not—Thomas’s motion would still fail because the materials he seeks are not\nin the prosecution team’s possession.\n\nThe BOP is not, and never has been, part of the prosecution team. Nor did the BOP conduct\nan investigation jointly or in coordination with the prosecution team.° To require the Government\nto obtain and produce any records from the BOP from a separate investigation, as well as evidence\nthat would support Thomas’s purported (and improper, for the reasons discussed in Part II.B,\n\n® The defendant claims, based on a CNN article, that the U.S. Marshal Service (“USMS”)\nconducted an investigation. The Government is unaware of such an investigation, and in any\nevent, any such inquiry by the USMS was not conducted jointly or in coordination with the\nprosecution team.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR- ooo22o82\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023483.jpg": "OIG Official Draft Report: BOP’s Care, Custody, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at MCC New York,\nNew York\nJune 22, 2o23\nPage 2 of 3\nIn April of this year, BOP’s leadership announced ts new mission as \"corrections professionals\nwho foster a humane and secure environment and ensure public safety by preparing individuals\nfor successful reentry into our communities.\" BOP’s new core values include accountability,\nintegrity, respect, compassion, and correctional excellence. Of note, our core value of\naccountability requires BOP employees to be responsible and <span class=\"highlight\">transparent</span> to the public,\nourselves, and to those in our care and custody by the standards we establish, the actions we take,\nand the duties we perform. As reflected in our mission and core values, BOP is commited to\nproviding a safe environment for both employees and adults in our custody.\nRecommendation One: The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate\nfollouing suicide watch or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the\nparticular individual or security considerations.\nBOP’s Response: The BOP recognizes the importance of careful monitoring of adults in\ncustody who face mental health challenges and therefore concurs with this recommendation.\nOur practice is to carefully consider both the well-being and safety of the individual involved\nand overarching safety and security concerns. In the years since Mr. Epstein’s death, the BOP\nhas updated its process related to suicide watch and psychological observation. Under BOP’s\nrevised process, upon removal from suicide watch or psychological observation, psychologists\nmake individualized care recommendations about clinical follou-up and other custodial\nconcerns, including housing and cellmates. Mental health, custody, and unit team employees\nwork collaboratively to ensure that each individual removed from suicide watch is housed\nappropriately.\nRecommendation Two: The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for\nsuicide and for whom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the\nrecommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan for cellmate\nre-assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or security\nconsiderations.\nBOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation. As described in its response to\nRecommendation l, BOP’s current process related to suicide watch and psychological\nobservation applies an individualized approach to the care and custody of adults in custody.\nUpon removal from suicide watch or psychological observation, individualized care\nrecommendations are made by psychologists, custody, and unit team for each individual. BOP\nthoroughly evaluates each celling assignment on an individual basis for persons deemed to be at\nmoderate to high risk for suicide.\nRecommendation Three: The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and\ndocumenting approval for social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or\npsychological observation, which allous for institution-specific variations in the process, and\nprovide guidance on standard components that each institution should include in its process to\nmitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on suicide watch or psychological\nobservation.\n\nll6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23483\n"};
