Co—counsel, members of the press, and the public may access the audio feed\nof the proceeding by calling a dial-in number, which the Court will provide in\nadvance of the proceeding by subsequent order. Given the high degree of public\ninterest in this case, a video feed of the remote proceeding will be available for\nviewing in the Jury Assembly Room located at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan\nCourthouse, 5oo Pearl Street, New York, NY. Due to social distancing requirements,\nseating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional persons will\nbe admited. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID—l9 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who\nappears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the\nproceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their\ntemperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions,\natached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon\nentry. Only persons who meet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire\nand whose temperatures are belou loo.4 degrees will be alloued to enter the\ncourthouse. Face coverings that cover the nose and mouth must be worn at all times.\nAnyone who fails to comply with the COVID—l9 protocols that have been adopted by\nthe Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no exceptions. As\ndiscussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the\nWaiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the\nproceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form\n(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-—l74 of March 27,\n2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24\nhours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.\" Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4). The\nCourt will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from\ntoday through July l4, 2o2o. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a\nremote proceeding, the Court finds \"that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]\noutweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\" l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l6l(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss\na potential protective order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in\na manner protective of the rights of third parties.

The United States Atorney's Office should email Chambers with\ninformation regarding any alleged victims who are entitled, pursuant to l8 U.S.C.\n§377l(a)(4), to be heard at the bail hearing and who wish to be heard. The Court will\nthen provide information as to the logistics for their dial-in access. As the Court\ndescribed in a previous order, members of the press and public may watch and listen to\nthe live video feed in the Jury Assembly Room, at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan\nCourthouse, 5oo Pearl Street.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo848", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000849.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document l-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65965, Pagelo of 24\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

No. 89. The\nGovernment did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. After\ndue consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions. The\nCourt's decision to adopt those redactions is guided by the three—part test articulated\nby the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir.\n2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the documents in\nquestion are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of the common law\npresumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access.

COVID—l9 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who\nappears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the\nproceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their\ntemperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions,\natached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon\nentry.

There are no exceptions. As\ndiscussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the\nWaiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the\nproceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form\n(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-—l74 of March 27,\n2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24\nhours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.\" Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4). The\nCourt will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from\ntoday through July l4, 2o2o. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a\nremote proceeding, the Court finds \"that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]\noutweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\" l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l6l(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss\na potential protective order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in\na manner protective of the rights of third parties.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo886", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000887.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 3-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65978, Pagell of 25\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

After determining which, if\nany, portions of the Opinion and Order should be redacted, the Court will file the\nOpinion and Order on the public docket. As a result, the Court concludes that the\nGovernment has met its burden of persuasion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and\nthat pretrial detention continues to be warranted. On or before December 3o, 2o2o, the\nparties are ORDERED to submit a joint leter indicating whether they propose any\nredactions and the justification for any such proposal.

On February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its\nomnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants’ twelve pretrial motions. It filed\nthe brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the\nCourt's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See\nDkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket\non ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file\na leter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding\npages ll28 and l87l88 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2o2l. The\nparties are further ORDERED to meet, confer, and jointly propose redactions to the\nDefendant's cover leter objecting to the Government's proposed redactions by March\n22, 2o2l.

Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\nUnited States Courthouse\nAO Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\n\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nWe write on behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, to respectfully request that the Court\norder the Bureau of Prisons to give Ms. Maxwell access to the laptop computer provided by the\ngovernment so that she can review discovery on weekends and holidays.\n\nAt the request of defense counsel, the government provided Ms. Maxwell with a laptop\ncomputer to review the voluminous discovery, which was produced on a series of external hard\ndrives. Currently, Ms. Maxwell is given access to the laptop only on weekdays. On weekends\nand holidays, Ms. Maxwell must use the prison computer on her floor to review discovery.\nHouever, the prison computer is not equipped with the software necessary to read large portions\nof the discovery recently produced by the government. As a result, Ms. Maxwell loses several\ndays of review time every weekend and every holiday because she does not have access to the\nlaptop. If Ms. Maxwell is to have any hope of reviewing the millions of documents produced in\ndiscovery so that she can properly prepare her defense by the July l2, 2o2l trial date, she must\nhave access to the laptop every day, including weekends and holidays.\n\nDefense counsel has raised this issue with the government and it has no objection to Ms.\nMaxwell having access to the laptop seven days a week. At the request of defense counsel, the\ngovernment has contacted officials at the MDC on several occasions in the past few weeks to\nrequest that they lift this restriction, but without success.\n\nThere is no principled justification for this restriction. Ms. Maxwell was given access to\nthe laptop every day (including weekends and the Thanksgiving holiday) for the entire l4-day\nperiod that she was quarantined in her isolation cell in November-December 2o2o because she had\ncome into close contact with a member of the MDC staff who had tested positive for COVID. In\naddition, the laptop is kept in a locker in the same room where the prison computer is located, so it\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool35l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001352.jpg": "Cases: 2o-cr/ oo88 t+AN St B6camMent 4/2B 2 Filed/OVhs/PagPage hast 2\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJanuary l4, 2o2l\nPage 2\nwould not require any change in Ms. Maxwell’s movements to give her the requested access.\nFurthermore, on at least three occasions since she was released from quarantine, Ms. Maxwell’s\nsecurity team gave her the laptop to review discovery on the weekend.\nThere is clearly no actual impediment preventing the MDC staff from providing Ms.\nMaxwell access to the laptop on weekends and holidays. Given the millions of documents that\nMs. Maxwell must review before trial in order to prepare her defense, it is critical that she be\ngiven as much time as possible with the laptop to review the discovery. We therefore respectfully\nrequest that the Court order the BOP to give Ms. Maxwell access to the laptop on weekends and\nholidays during the hours that she is permited to review discovery.\nSincerely,\n__/s/ <span class=\"highlight\">Christian</span> Everdell _\n<span class=\"highlight\">Christian</span> R.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter to request that the Court schedule an\narraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing in the above referenced case. On July 2, 2o2o,\nthe defendant was arrested in Bradford, New Hampshire on the charges contained in the above-\ncaptioned Indictment and presented before a United States Magistrate Judge in the District of New\nHampshire. At that appearance, the defendant waived her right to an identity hearing, consented\nto detention without prejudice to making a later application for bail, and consented to her transfer\nto the Southern District of New York.\n\nWhile the Government has no control over the timing of the defendant’s transport, the\nGovernment understands from the United States Marshals Service (“USMS”) that the USMS is\nacting expeditiously to transport the defendant into this District. In particular, the Government\nunderstands that the USMS expects that the defendant will arrive in this District early this week,\nwell within the ten days contemplated by the Speedy Trial Act for transfer of a defendant from\nanother district. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(l)(F).\n\nThe Government has consulted with defense counsel, <span class=\"highlight\">Christian</span> Everdell, Esq., who has\nrequested that the arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing in this mater take place on July\nlo, 2o2o. In advance of that proceeding, the parties jointly request that the defense be permited\nto file a writen bail application to the Court by 3:oo p.m. on July 9, 2o2o, and that the Government\nbe permited to file a writen reply by l2:oo p.m. on July lo, 2o2o. If that schedule is acceptable\nto the Court, the parties respectfully request that the Court schedule an arraignment, initial\nappearance, and bail hearing in this mater for the afternoon of July lo, 2o2o.\n\nAdditionally, the Government respectfully requests that the Court exclude time under the\nSpeedy Trial Act between the defendant’s arrest on July 2, 2o2o and the date of the arraignment,\ninitial appearance, and bail hearing before Your Honor. In addition to part of this time being\nnecessary to transport the defendant to this District, and thus subject to an automatic exclusion of\nup to ten days from Speedy Trial Act calculation, see l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(l)(F), the Government\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool497", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001498.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document5 Filed o7/o5/2o Page 2 of 2\nHonorable Alison J.

On July 9, 2o2o, the government provided\ndefense counsel with an initial draft of a proposed protective order. Since that time, the parties\nhave conferred several times on conference calls and by email, and have been able to reach\nagreement on almost all of the provisions of the proposed protective order.\n\nTwo key disputes remain, houever, which require the Court’s guidance. First, the\ndefense believes that potential government witnesses and their counsel should be subject to the\nsame restrictions as the defense concerning appropriate use of the discovery materials—namely,\nif these individuals are given access to discovery materials during trial preparation, they may not\nuse those materials for any purpose other than preparing for trial in the criminal case, and may\nnot post those materials on the Internet. Second, the defense believes it should not be restricted\nfrom publicly disclosing or disseminating the identity of any alleged victims or potential\nwitnesses referenced in the discovery materials who have already identified themselves by\nspeaking on the public record.\n\nAs set forth belou, we believe that the proposed protective order contains appropriate\nrestrictions that are no broader than necessary to protect the privacy interests of individuals\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool643", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001646.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 29 Filed o7/27/2o Page 4 of 4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\nUnited States Courthouse\nAO Foley Square\nNew York, New York looo7\n\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this leter to reply to\nthe government’s response leter and submission regarding the proposed protective order in the\nabove-captioned case, dated July 28, 2o2o (“Government’s Response” or “Gov’t Resp.”) (Dkt.\n33).\n\nThe parties have met and conferred, resolving nearly all the issues relating to the\nproposed protective order. The parties agree that there are two areas of dispute as to which we\nrequire guidance from the Court. As noted in our opening leter and belou, we respectfully\nsubmit that the arguments made by the government are unavailing, and that the defense’s\nproposed protective order, atached as Exhibit A to our initial submission (Dkt. 29), should be\nentered by the Court.\n\nl. Referencing Individuals Who Have Publicly Identified Themselves\n\nThe starting point for evaluating the scope of a proposed protective order is whether there\nare valid privacy interests at issue. It is the government’s burden to establish “good cause” that\ndisclosure will cause “a clearly defined and serious injury.” United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d\nl94, 2ll (3d Cir. 2oo7) (citation omited). The Court should also ensure that the proposed\nrestriction is “no broader than is necessary” to protect that interest, and must consider the impact\nthat the restriction may have “on a defendant’s due process right to prepare and present a full\ndefense at trial.” United States v. Lindh, l98 F. Supp. 2d 739, 742 (E.D. Va. 2oo2). Throughout\nits leter, the government inverts this standard, claiming that the burden is on the defense (which,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool685", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001689.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 35 Filed o7/29/2o Page5of5\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 29, 2o2o\nPage 5\n\nBut this argument misses the point. The defense does not seek to impose any restrictions\non the government’s ability to share discovery materials with prospective witnesses and their\ncounsel in whatever manner it deems necessary and appropriate. Instead, the defense is seeking\na restriction, not on the government, but on what the prospective witnesses and their counsel can\ndo with those materials in the interest of fairness to the defendant.\n\nThe government argues that the defense’s proposal should be rejected because there does\nnot appear to be a similar precedent. (/d. at 6). But the defense’s proposal is necessary given the\nuncommon circumstances of this case. Here, there are numerous women who may be witnesses\nin the government’s case who have simultaneously sued Ms. Maxwell, alleging the same conduct\nas that alleged in the indictment. Indeed, the criminal case and the civil cases are already\nintertwined because significant portions of the indictment appear to be based on a 2ol9 civil\ncomplaint filed against Ms. Maxwell by one of her accusers. Many of the accusers have also\nrepeatedly made public allegations against Ms. Maxwell in the press and on social media. The\ndefense has a legitimate concern that these individuals and their counsel will impermissibly use\nany discovery materials that are shared with them in this case to bolster their civil cases or to run\nto the press.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this leter to reply to\nthe government’s leter, dated August l3, 2o2o, responding to Ms. Maxwell’s request that the\nCourt (i) direct the government to disclose the identities of the three alleged victims referenced\nin the indictment, subject to the restrictions of the protective order in this case; and (il) order the\nBureau of Prisons (“BOP”) to provide Ms. Maxwell with increased access to the discovery\nmaterials (“Government’s Response” or “Gov’t Resp.”) (Dkt. 4l).\n\nWith regard to the issue of alleged victims’ identities, the government concedes, as it\nmust, that this Court has the authority and discretion to order the relief sought, but claims that\nMs. Maxwell’s application should be denied as untimely and without merit. (Gov’t Resp. at 2-\n4). Instead, the government asserts that the appropriate and timely way for Ms. Maxwell to seek\nconfirmation of their identities is through a request for a bill of particulars, which should be filed\nin December 2o2o. (/d. at 3). The government then notes that it would oppose such a motion,\nwhich it claims should also be denied. (/d.). The government concludes that it will finally\nprovide confirmation of their identities in the 35oo material and a witness list to be provided\nshortly before trial. (/d. at 4).\n\nThe upshot of this is clear: in the government’s view, Ms. Maxwell should not knou the\nidentity of the three witnesses referenced in the indictment until at best just before trial, and\nshould have to spend the next eleven months (or longer) trying to conduct a defense\ninvestigation, in a case in which she is presumed innocent, without having this information.\nThis information is critical to conducting a meaningful defense investigation, given that the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool724", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001728.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 42 Filed o8/l7/2o Page5of5\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Even on more routine maters, Ms. Maxwell’s treatment has\nbeen worse than other pretrial detainees. For example, Ms. Maxwell has no access to email and\nhas been given 3o minutes per month for personal phone calls, far fewer than the 5oo minutes\ngranted to other pretrial detainees since the COVID-l9 crisis. Unlike defendants in the general\npopulation, she does not have a desk or a writing surface where she can take notes when\nreviewing the discovery. And until recently, Ms. Maxwell was denied access to the prison\ncommissary for no apparent reason.\n\nWe respect that the BOP needs to ensure the orderly operation of the MDC. But Ms.\nMaxwell’s conditions of confinement are unique to her and seem punitive rather than anything\nnecessary to ensure that the MDC as a whole is running smoothly.

Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\nUnited States Courthouse\nAO Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nWe write on behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, in opposition to the government’s\nOctober 6, 2o2o leter requesting the Court’s permission to delay the disclosure of photographs\nand documents relating to certain alleged victims of sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein (the\n“Materials”), pursuant to Rule l6(d)(l) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. (Dkt. 6o).\nThe government’s request should be denied for two reasons.\n\nFirst, it is clear from the government’s leter that the Materials pertain to individuals who\nclaim to have been “sexually abused by [Jeffrey] Epstein” (id. at 2), but who have not accused Ms.\nMaxwell of participating in or facilitating that conduct in any way. Accordingly, the Materials\nidentifying these witnesses and their prior statements are exculpatory evidence, which must be\ndisclosed pursuant to the government’s obligations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (l963)\nand its progeny.’\n\nSecond, the Court should order the government to disclose the Materials under Rule l6\nbecause the Materials are “material to preparing the defense” and the government has not shoun\ngood cause to delay production of the Materials under Rule l6(d)(l).\n\n' We note that yesterday we sent the government a leter making specific Brady requests, including “[a|ny statements\n\nor writen communications made by any witness who has alleged that she was sexually abused or assaulted by Mr.\n\nEpstein, but has not alleged that Ms. Maxwell participated in, was involved in, or facilitated the alleged sexual abuse.”\nDOJ-OGR-ooool795", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001799.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 64 Filed lo/l4/2o Page 5 of 6\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nOctober l4, 2o2o\n\nPage 5\nsensitive information about them. (/d.). The government further asserts that such disclosure will\n“Seopardize the government’s ongoing investigation” because it will reveal to the defendant the\nscope of the government’s investigation and may deter other alleged victims from coming forward\nto provide evidence. (/d. at l,3). Essentially, the government is arguing that disclosure of the\nMaterials should be delayed because it would rather not let Ms. Maxwell knou, at this stage of the\nproceedings, who the government spoke to, and because it is concerned that other people might\nnot come forward to provide additional evidence against Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThese are not the sorts of concerns that courts have found may jeopardize an ongoing\ninvestigation and establish good cause for delaying disclosure. Courts typically allou delayed\ndisclosure on these grounds when immediate disclosure may alert other potential targets of the\ninvestigation that they are being investigated or may identify individuals who are proactively\ncooperating with the government to gather evidence against other potential targets. The cases\ncited in the government’s oun leter make this clear. See Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d at 53l-32\n(disclosure of certain discovery materials might “alert the targets of the investigation and could\nlead to efforts by them to frustrate the ongoing investigations”); United States v. Mennino, 48o F.\nSupp. ll82, ll88 (S.D.N.Y. l979) (government’s ongoing investigation into other potential\ndefendants could be disrupted by disclosure of certain discovery materials). Similarly, courts\noften grant protective orders in this context when the government has made a sufficient shouing\nthat disclosure may lead to witness intimidation or threats to their safety. See United States v.\nUrena, 989 F. Supp. 2d 253, 262-63 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (collecting cases).\n\nThe government has done neither here. The government has not made any shouing that\ndisclosure would thwart an ongoing investigation into other potential targets, or would jeopardize\nthe safety of any potential witnesses. Instead, the government asserts a speculative and self-\nserving concern that disclosure of the Materials it might make it more difficult to recruit additional\nwitnesses for its existing case against Ms. Maxwell. That is not the type of “clearly defined,\nspecific and serious injury” that establishes good cause to delay disclosure under Rule l6(d)(l).\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny the government’s requested relief under\nRule l6(d)(l) and instead order the government to immediately produce the Materials and the\nprior statements of these witnesses to the defense.\n\nSincerely,\n\n/s/ <span class=\"highlight\">Christian</span> Everdell\n<span class=\"highlight\">Christian</span> R.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we plan to file a Renewed Motion for\nRelease on Bail (the “Motion”) and respectfully request an in camera conference, with all\ncounsel present, to address the appropriate procedures for the filing and consideration of the\nMotion. For the reasons explained belou, we intend to request, pursuant to Fed. R. Crim.

We believe an\nin camera conference would be the most efficient form to address these issues and other\nconfidentiality concerns related to the Motion. We intend to provide a full set of materials to the\ngovernment, Pretrial Services, and the Court when the Motion is filed. We are merely requesting\nthat sensitive contents of the submission be accorded confidentiality protections similar to those\nthat the government routinely requires in protective orders, including the one in this case.\n\nIn the four months since this Court denied Ms. Maxwell’s request for bail and granted the\ngovernment’s motion for detention, Ms. Maxwell and her counsel have assembled substantial\ninformation that was not available to present at the initial hearing, as well as a comprehensive\nbail package co-signed by sureties who were unable to come forward at that time. Accordingly,\nMs. Maxwell nou seeks to renew her request for bail pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s renewed application will rely on sensitive and private information that, if\nmade public, would be highly damaging to both Ms. Maxwell and third parties, including:\n\n* Leters from Ms. Maxwell’s family members and close friends, who have agreed to\nserve as sureties to support Ms. Maxwell’s renewed bail application.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this leter in response\nto the Court’s order, dated November 25, 2o2o, directing Ms. Maxwell to justify why her leter\nof the same date requesting an in camera conference to discuss confidentiality concerns related\nto her Renewed Motion for Release on Bail (the “Motion”) should be sealed or redacted.\n\nWe continue to believe that sealing the November 25, 2o2o leter (the “November 25\"\nLeter”) in its entirety is warranted and appropriate under the governing case law. Houever, in\nresponse to the Court’s order, we ask the Court to file a redacted version of the November 25\nLeter, atached hereto as Exhibit A, which redacts only the information necessary to protect\nthird parties from threats and harassment. In addition, because this leter must make reference to\nthe same confidential information contained in the November 25\" Leter in order to justify the\nproposed redactions, we further ask the Court to file a redacted version of this leter, atached as\nExhibit B. If the Court is not inclined to allou any of these redactions, we request leave to\nwithdraw both leters and refile the November 25\" Leter with the redacted sentences deleted.\n\nEvery submission related to the Motion, including this leter, presents the defense with a\nCatch-22. To support Ms. Maxwell’s position regarding sealing and confidentiality, we are\nasked to provide the Court with specific information about the people supporting Ms. Maxwell’s\nbail application and the need for sealing. But until we knou what confidentiality protections the\nCourt is willing to put in place, we are obligated to protect these people from the potentially\ndevastating consequences of being publicly identified by divulging as litle information about\nthem as possible. We therefore continue to believe that an in camera conference, atended by all\ncounsel, is the best way to address all of the confidentiality issues related to the Motion.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool855", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001858.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 87 Filed l2/o4/2o Page 4 of 4\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

(Dkt. lo4, lo6).\n\nRule 4(b)(4) provides that a district court may, upon a finding of “good cause,” extend the\ntime to file a notice of appeal “for a period not to exceed 3o days.” Fed. R. App. P. 4(b)(4). In\ncriminal cases, a defendant’s notice of appeal must be filed “within l4 days after ... the entry of\neither the judgment or the order being appealed.” Fed. R. App. P. 4(b)(l)(A)(i).. The Court’s\norder denying Ms. Maxwell’s renewed motion for bail was entered on December 28, 2o2o. (Dkt.\nlo4, lo6). Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell’s notice of appeal of that order must be filed on or before\nMonday, January ll, 2o2l.\n\nThere is good cause for an extension here. Ms. Maxwell is considering whether to submit\na third bail application to the Court, which would propose even more stringent and restrictive bail\nconditions than those proposed in the renewed bail application. The requested extension will give\nMs. Maxwell the opportunity to research whether and to what extent these additional conditions\nare legally and practicably available, without forfeiting as untimely a possible appeal from the\nCourt’s December 28 Order denying the renewed bail application. The additional time is also\nwarranted because it will enable the defense to continue its review of recently produced\ndocuments and to file our pretrial motions (each of which may bear on the merits of a possible\nthird bail application); to research whether an appeal of the December 28 Order might deprive this\nCourt of jurisdiction to address a third bail application; and because of logistical challenges posed\nby the continued effects of the pandemic.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2259", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002260.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo9 Filed ol/o8/2l Page 2 of 2\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Ms. Maxwell has therefore made a prima\nfacie shouing of a violation of the fair cross-section requirement.\n\nAccordingly, the government has the burden of shouing that atainment of a fair cross-\nsection would have been incompatible with a significant state interest. The government cannot\ndo so. To the extent that the government asserts a significant state interest in containing\nCOVID-l9, it cannot shou that atainment of a fair cross-section would have been incompatible\nwith that interest. As noted above, a Manhatan grand jury convened as early as June 25, 2o2o;\nthere appears to have been no reason, other than a publicity-driven desire to arrest Ms. Maxwell\non the anniversary of the Epstein indictment, why the government could not have waited until\nthat time.

During\nVTC conferences, counsel can hear conversation among the guards, so it is likely that the guards, who seem to be\nwriting during those sessions, are able to hear discussions between Ms. Maxwell and counsel. Last night, prior to the\nfiling of defense replies to Ms. Maxwell’s pretrial motions, the MDC refused her request to speak with her lawyers\nto provide information bearing on those filings,.

By choosing to seek an indictment in White Plains, the government chose a grand jury\nselection process guaranteed to draw from a pool that would underrepresent Black and Hispanic\njurors via-a-vis the Manhatan Counties and the Southern District.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nWe write to respectfully request the Court to issue an order to the MDC directing it to\naccept two hard drives from defense counsel that contain the non-Highly Confidential discovery in\nthis case for Ms. Maxwell’s use at the MDC.\n\nIn an effort to facilitate Ms. Maxwell’s review of the discovery, defense counsel have\ncreated a master set of two hard drives that contain a complete set of the discovery produced by\nthe government so far, excluding the materials marked Highly Confidential, which Ms. Maxwell is\nnot permited to possess in the MDC pursuant to the terms of the Protective Order. The master\ndrives are easier to use than her existing hard drives because they collect all of the material in one\nplace and organize the documents in a more user-friendly format. For example, the November l8,\n2o2o production containing roughly 2.2 million pages was produced in load file format, which\ncontains images of individual pages of documents in native file format, image file format, and\nother formats. The hard drives organize these files by document, as opposed to by page, and\neliminate duplicative file formats so that Ms. Maxwell will not have to add countless hours to her\nreview.\n\nDefense counsel would like to send these hard drives to Ms. Maxwell for her to use in the\nMDC. We were informed by the MDC Legal Department that they are only permited to accept\nhard drives that are loaded and certified by the U.S. Atorney’s Office. We have conferred with\nthe government, which has advised that it does not object to the defense making an application to\nthe Court to issue an order directing the MDC to accept the hard drives. The government\nrequested, houever, that the Court allou MDC legal counsel the opportunity to note their\nobjections to the Court.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o63", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004064.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 26o _ Filed o4/3o/2l Page 2of2\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nWe respectfully submit this leter to bring to the Court’s atention the recent decision by\nthe Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. William Henry Cosby\nJr., J-loo-2o2o (Jun. 3o, 2o2l), in which the Court vacated Mr. Cosby’s conviction and sentence\nbecause the District Atorney’s Office that prosecuted him failed to live up to its express promise\nnot to prosecute Mr. Cosby for the same crimes for which he was later convicted.! Ms. Maxwell’s\ncase presents a similar situation. As we argued in our supplemental pretrial motions currently\npending before the Court (Dkt. 293), the government has failed to abide by its promise not to\nprosecute Ms. Maxwell for the offenses for which she was immunized by the Epstein Non-\nProsecution Agreement (“NPA”). We submit that this decision provides support for Ms.\nMaxwell’s supplemental motion to dismiss Counts One, Three, Five, and Six of the S2 Indictment\nfor violation of the NPA.\n\nIn Cosby, Andrea Constand alleged that Mr. Cosby sexually assaulted her in his residence\nin January 2oo4. (Op. 4-5). Ms. Constand did not immediately report the assault to law\nenforcement authorities and continued to have contact with Mr. Cosby in the follouing months.\n(Id. at 5-7). In January 2oo5, approximately one year after the assault, Ms. Constand reported Mr.\nCosby’s conduct to the police. (/d. at 6). The Montgomery County District Atorney’s Office\ninvestigated the allegations, but then-District Atorney Bruce Castor determined that “there was\ninsufficient credible and admissible evidence” to bring criminal charges against Mr. Cosby. (/d. at\n7-lo). Among the factors weighing against bringing charges were that (l) Ms. Constand had\nwaited a year to file her complaint, which diminished the reliability of Ms. Constand’s\nrecollections; (i) Ms. Constand’s statements about the events were inconsistent; (il) there was a\nlack of corroborating evidence; (iv) Ms. Constand continued to speak to and meet with Mr. Cosby\n!

The underlying motion papers reference the names\nof accusers and potential witnesses who have spoken on the public record in this case and others\nwho have spoken publicly but not associated themselves directly with this case. The Court has\nruled that the existence of the Protective Order, by itself, is not sufficient to justify redactions, and\nthat any redactions must be justified under the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in\nLugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6).\n\nThe defense has consistently taken the position that the names of the accusers and other\nwitnesses who have chosen to speak to the media about their alleged experiences, including\nregarding the very materials sought by the subpoena, should be publicly disclosed and that it is not\nthe defense’s burden to justify redacting their names. Accordingly, the defense does not seek any\nredactions. If the government wishes to seek any redactions, we respectfully submit that it is their\nburden — not Ms. Maxwell’s — to justify them under Lugosch.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5oo5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005006.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 323 Filed o8/l9/2l Page2of2\nThe Honorable Alison J.

For the reasons set forth\nbelou and in our prior motion, the evidence related to Accuser-3 is not direct evidence of any of\nthe conspiracies charged in the S2 Indictment and is improper propensity evidence that should be\nexcluded under Rule 4o4(b) and Rule 4o3 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n\nl. Accuser-3’s Evidence Is Not Direct Evidence of Any Conspiracy Charged in the S2\n\nIndictment\n\nThe Court asked the government to do two things at the November l, 2o2l pretrial\nconference concerning the admissibility of Accuser-3’s evidence: (i) provide additional briefing\non why Accuser-3’s evidence could potentially be admited as direct evidence of the sex\ntrafficking conspiracy charged in Count Five, and (il) outline in further detail Accuser-3’s\n2o498o8.l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7437", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007447.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 494 _ Filed ll/22/2l Pagellofl2\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Accuser-3 Cannot Be Considered a “Victim” for Any Legal Purpose\nThe Court ruled at the November lo\" hearing that Accuser-3 could not be considered a\n“victim” of the crimes charged in the S2 Indictment and that the government should not refer to\nher as a “victim” or a “minor.” Accordingly, there is no need for the defense to respond to the\ngovernment’s November 7\" Leter.\nRespectfully submited,\n__/s/ <span class=\"highlight\">Christian</span> Everdell\n<span class=\"highlight\">Christian</span> R.

Among other things, the Juror told\nreporters that he disclosed to the other members of the jury during deliberations that he was a\nvictim of sexual abuse and further described his memory of those events. According to the Juror,\nhis disclosure influenced the deliberations and convinced other members of the jury to convict Ms.\nMaxwell.\n\n! See Lucia Osborne-Crouley, “‘They were all believable’: Maxwell juror says jury was convinced by accusers’\naccounts of a patern of abuse,” The Independent (Jan. 4, 2o22); Laura Collins and Daniel Bates, “Ghislaine was a\npredator as guilty as Epstein’: Maxwell juror describes moment he ‘locked eyes’ with sex trafficker and reveals his\noun abuse ordeal,” Daily Mail (Jan. 5, 2o22), available at htps:/Avww.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-\nlo37ol93/Ghislaine-Maxwell-juror-says-evidence-convinced-panel-predator.html; Luc Cohen, “Some Ghislaine\nMaxwell jurors initially doubted accusers, juror says,” Reuters (Jan. 5, 2o22).\n2o7o3ol.l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo88ol", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008802.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document569_ Filed ol/o5/22 Page2of3\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nWe write in response to the Court’s email yesterday, January 24, 2o22, requesting that the\nparties submit a revised copy of Court Exhibit 2 with Carolyn Andriano’s last name redacted. For\nthe reasons set forth belou, the defense believes that Ms. Andriano’s last name should not be\nredacted in the publicly filed version of Court Exhibit 2.\n\nThe redactions to Court Exhibit 2 were the subject of some discussion among the parties.\nThe government originally proposed that Court Exhibit 2 should be filed under seal because the\nlist of names is alphabetized and redacting only anonymized names would provide identifying\ninformation for anonymized witnesses. The defense objected to that proposal on the grounds that\nit was unnecessary and overbroad to seal the entire document and that the names of anonymized\nwitnesses could be redacted.\n\nThe defense further objected to Ms. Andriano’s name being redacted in any way due to her\nrecent post-trial interview with the Daily Mail, in which she publicly disclosed her full name and\ndeclared her intention to waive her right to anonymity. According to the article, Ms. Andriano\nstated the follouing:\n\n2o86l75.l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8849", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008851.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document589 _ Filed ol/28/22 Page3of3\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nWe write in response to the Court’s order, dated January 26, 2o22, requiring the defense to\nfile a leter on the public docket justifying our request to seal Ms. Maxwell’s Motion for a New\nTrial and accompanying exhibits (collectively, the “Motion’’) under the three-part test in Lugosch\nv. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Dkt. 585.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Motion urges the Court to right a grievous wrong that deprived Ms. Maxwell of a\nfundamental constitutional right — her right to be tried by a fair and impartial jury. Juror 5o’s\nresponses to the jury questionnaire and questions posed to him during in-person voir dire\ncorrupted the voir dire process and violated Ms. Maxwell’s right to a fair trial. As set forth in the\nMotion, the defense believes that the existing record is clear and more than sufficient for the Court\nto grant Ms. Maxwell a new trial without the need for further factual development. Should the\nCourt agree with the defense, the Motion could be unsealed and publicly docketed at the same\ntime the Court issues its ruling with no additional delay.\n\n2o873o6.l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8852", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008860.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document59o _ Filed o2/ol/22 Page9of9\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Apr. l5, 2o2l).?\n\nFinally, it is important to emphasize that Ms. Maxwell does not seek to seal the Motion\nindefinitely. She seeks only a temporary sealing to protect the integrity of any fact-finding process\nordered by the Court. In this case, the pretrial motions remained under seal for several weeks\nbefore they were filed on the docket in redacted form. That limited delay did not have a\nmeaningful impact on the public’s right of access or the press’ ability to report on this case. So\ntoo here. Indeed, it could potentially take less time for the Court to rule on the Motion or for a\nhearing to be completed.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should order that the Motion remain temporarily\nsealed until the Court rules on Ms. Maxwell’s Motion or until the conclusion of any hearing\nordered by the Court. The Court should further order the government to file its response under\nseal so that the defense can assert its position regarding sealing.\n\nSincerely,\n\n/s/ <span class=\"highlight\">Christian</span> Everdell\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Christian</span> R.

Dkt. 6lo.\nRenewed Request for Counsel to Conduct the Questioning of Juror 5o\nMs. Maxwell reiterates her request that the Court allou counsel to conduct the questioning\nof Juror 5o during the upcoming hearing. Atorney-conducted questioning enhances the\nopportunity and ability to elicit bias on the part of the juror. See, e.g., Johnson & Haney, Felony\nVoir Dire: An Exploratory Study of its Contents and Effect, l8 Law and Human Behavior 3o9\n(l994). To smoke out the reasons why Juror 5o did not truthfully answer Questions 48 and 25 on\nthe jury questionnaire, he must be cross-examined. Defense counsel is in the best position to\nconduct that cross-examination. This was the procedure that Judge Pauley folloued in United\nStates v. Daugerdas, and there is no reason to follou a different procedure here. See Dkt. 6l6-l.\n2loo689.3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9638", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009659.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document636 Filed o3/ol/22 Page 22 of 22\nThe Honorable Alison J.

As noted in the Government’s September l5, 2o2l leter, although the Government\nbelieves that Examiner Flatley’s testimony will not require admission through Rule 7o2 of the\nFederal Rules of Evidence, the Government provided expert notice. In an abundance of caution,\nthe Government is providing additional description of Examiner Flatley’s anticipated testimony.\n\nThe Government anticipates that Examiner Flatley will testify regarding the forensic\nexamination of the devices marked for identification as Government Exhibits 54 and 55, and his\ndetermination that those exhibits are clones. He is expected to testify that a clone is an exact copy\nof one piece of media to another. Examiner Flatley is expected to explain that he connected\nGovernment Exhibits 54 and 55 to a write blocker and subsequently imaged, or made an exact\ncopy, of the exhibits. The Government anticipates that Examiner Flatley will explain that the\nimages of Government Exhibits 54 and 55 are exact copies of the original devices because he ran\na hash, or mathematical algorithm that uniquely identifies data, on the original devices and the\nimages, which are identical.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll9l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011200.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o2 Filed o7/l2/22 Page4of4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The government’s request is yet another example of its\nrepeated atempts to relitigate issues that have been decided against them. The Court’s instruction\nis appropriate and balanced and should not be changed.\n\nWe should be clear from the outset — we are in this position because the government is\ninsisting on calling a witness who has alleged conduct that is not illegal. The Court has ruled, and\nthe government has itself conceded, that Witness-3 “is not a victim of any of the crimes charged in\nthe Indictment.” ll/l9/2o2l Op. and Order at 2. The Court has correctly recognized that having\nWitness-3 describe the details of her sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein would have no probative value\nbecause it cannot establish an element of the charged offenses. See id. at 4 (“There is litle to no\nprobative value of a witness describing sexual activity when that witness’s testimony regarding the\nsexual activity cannot form the basis for the conviction of the crimes charged.’’); see also\n2o6l438.l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll33o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011332.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l8 Filed o7/l2/22 Page3of3\nThe Honorable Alison J.

See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form\n(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-—l74 of March 27,\n2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24\nhours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.” Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4). The\nCourt will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)Cl)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from\ntoday through July l4, 2o2o. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a\nremote proceeding, the Court finds \"that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]\noutweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\" l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l6l(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss\na potential protective order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in\na manner protective of the rights of third parties.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities.

No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9255", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019256.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document l-2, o9/o9/2o2o, 292774l, Pagel8 of l9\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

See Dkt. No. 7.

In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.” Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4). The\nCourt will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)Cl)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from\ntoday through July l4, 2o2o. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a\nremote proceeding, the Court finds \"that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]\noutweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\" l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l6l(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss\na potential protective order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in\na manner protective of the rights of third parties.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9273", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019274.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 5-2, o9/o9/2o2o, 2927755, Pagell of l2\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

SO ORDERED: (Signed by Judge\nAlison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o 37 | MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the language,\ntwo areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language allouing her to\npublicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public record to\nthe media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and their\ncounsel from using discovery materials for any purpose other than preparing for the\ncriminal trial in this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on both of\nthese issues. For the follouing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed\nprotective order Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the\ncourt may, for good cause, deny, restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other\nappropriate relief.\" The good cause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests,\nincluding whether dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others...\nwhether the imposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the\npublic's interest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing good\ncause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4). First, the\nCourt finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause with regard to\nrestricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged victims and witnesses\nother than those who have publicly identified themselves in this litigation. As a general\nmater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the privacy\nof alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the disclosure of their\nidentities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging that as a baseline the protective order should\n\"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing\nor disseminating the identity of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the\ndiscovery materials\"); see also United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr-48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist.\nLEXIS l94426, at *ll (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is\nsignificantly diminished for individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms.\nMaxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves.\nBut not all accusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or\ncontribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply\nmaking a public statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since\nsuch a statement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also allous\nthe Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be relevant... to\nPotential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the investigation and\npreparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This proposal adequately\nbalances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4,\nto the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the protective order for a specific\ninvestigative purpose, they can make applications to the Court on a case-by-case basis.\nSecond, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their counsel to use discovery\nmaterials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The\nrequest appears unprecedented despite the fact that there have been many high-profile\n\nhtps://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/DktRpt.pl?3477o8277l29655-L_l_o-l PP. 9/l2\nDOJ-OGR- oool9468", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019469.jpg": "9/l8/2o2o Case 2o-3o6l, Document 64pmyG7ReO2OcetB@828o2 Paget2 of l25\ncriminal maters that had related civil litigation. The Government labors under many\nrestrictions including Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy\nAct of l974, and other policies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office\nfor the Southern District of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to\nscrupulously follou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide\npotential witnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession.\nSee Dkt. No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be\nsubject to examination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them\nby the Government. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing reasons,\nthe Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be entered on the\ndocket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

On July 9, 2o2o, the government provided\ndefense counsel with an initial draft of a proposed protective order. Since that time, the parties\nhave conferred several times on conference calls and by email, and have been able to reach\nagreement on almost all of the provisions of the proposed protective order.\n\nTwo key disputes remain, houever, which require the Court’s guidance. First, the\ndefense believes that potential government witnesses and their counsel should be subject to the\nsame restrictions as the defense concerning appropriate use of the discovery materials—namely,\nif these individuals are given access to discovery materials during trial preparation, they may not\nuse those materials for any purpose other than preparing for trial in the criminal case, and may\nnot post those materials on the Internet. Second, the defense believes it should not be restricted\nfrom publicly disclosing or disseminating the identity of any alleged victims or potential\nwitnesses referenced in the discovery materials who have already identified themselves by\nspeaking on the public record.\n\nAs set forth belou, we believe that the proposed protective order contains appropriate\nrestrictions that are no broader than necessary to protect the privacy interests of individuals\n\nApp.o39\nDOJ-OGR-oool9498", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019501.jpg": "OGsedl ADA SBos Aden thc WHE 2o2 F iRB6 2A /PagPayei4l ab4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Due to social distancing requirements,\nseating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional persons will\nbe admited. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID—l9 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who\nappears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the\nproceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their\ntemperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions,\natached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon\nentry. Only persons who meet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire\nand whose temperatures are belou loo.4 degrees will be alloued to enter the\ncourthouse. Face coverings that cover the nose and mouth must be worn at all times.\nAnyone who fails to comply with the COVID—l9 protocols that have been adopted by\nthe Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no exceptions. As\ndiscussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the\nWaiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the\nproceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form\n(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-—l74 of March 27,\n2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24\nhours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.” Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4). The\nCourt will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from\ntoday through July l4, 2o2o. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a\nremote proceeding, the Court finds \"that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]\noutweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\" l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l6l(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss\na potential protective order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in\na manner protective of the rights of third parties.

(Everdell, <span class=\"highlight\">Christian</span>) (Entered: o7/29/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 36 | PROTECTIVE ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell...regarding procedures to be\nfolloued that shall govern the handling of confidential material. SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool97o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019703.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document l-2, ol/l2/2o2l, 3oll673, Pagelo of l9\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

See Dkt. Nos. 75, 88; see also Dkt. No. 78. The Defendant\nresponded to the MDC legal counsel's leter on December 7, 2o2o, reiterating her\nrequest that the Court summon Warden Heriberto Tellez to personally respond to\nquestions from the Court regarding the Defendant's conditions of confinement. See\nDkt. No. 9l.

No. 89. The\nGovernment did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. After\ndue consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions. The\nCourt's decision to adopt those redactions is guided by the three—part test articulated\nby the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir.\n2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the documents in\nquestion are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of the common law\npresumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access.

Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.” Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4). The\nCourt will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from\ntoday through July l4, 2o2o. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a\nremote proceeding, the Court finds \"that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]\noutweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\" l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l6l(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss\na potential protective order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in\na manner protective of the rights of third parties.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9725", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019726.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 3-2, ol/l2/2o2l, 3oll69l, Pagell of 2o\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

No. 89. The\nGovernment did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. After\ndue consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions.

Co—counsel, members of the press, and the public may access the audio feed\nof the proceeding by calling a dial-in number, which the Court will provide in\nadvance of the proceeding by subsequent order. Given the high degree of public\ninterest in this case, a video feed of the remote proceeding will be available for\nviewing in the Jury Assembly Room located at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan\nCourthouse, 5oo Pearl Street, New York, NY. Due to social distancing requirements,\nseating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional persons will\nbe admited. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID—l9 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who\nappears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the\nproceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their\ntemperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions,\natached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon\nentry. Only persons who meet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire\nand whose temperatures are belou loo.4 degrees will be alloued to enter the\ncourthouse. Face coverings that cover the nose and mouth must be worn at all times.\nAnyone who fails to comply with the COVID—l9 protocols that have been adopted by\nthe Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no exceptions. As\ndiscussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the\nWaiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the\nproceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form\n(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-—l74 of March 27,\n2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24\nhours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.\" Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4). The\nCourt will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from\ntoday through July l4, 2o2o. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a\nremote proceeding, the Court finds \"that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]\noutweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\" l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l6l(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss\na potential protective order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in\na manner protective of the rights of third parties.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9754", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019755.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 2o-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65965, Pagelo of 24\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

In light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially confidential\ninformation that should not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the\nparties 48 hours to propose any redactions to the Courts Opinion and Order and to\njustify those redactions by reference tothe Second Circuits decision in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo(2d Cir. 2oo6). After determining which, if\nany, portions of the Opinion and Order should be redacted, the Court will file the\nOpinion and Order on the public docket. As a result, the Court concludes that the\nGovernment has met its burden of persuasion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and\nthat pretrial detention continues to be warranted. On or before December 3o, 2o2o, the\nparties are ORDERED to submit a joint leter indicating whether they propose any\nredactions and the justification for any such proposal.

On February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its\nomnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants’ twelve pretrial motions. It filed\nthe brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the\nCourt's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See\nDkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket\non ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file\na leter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding\npages ll28 and l87l88 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2o2l. The\nparties are further ORDERED to meet, confer, and jointly propose redactions to the\nDefendant's cover leter objecting to the Government's proposed redactions by March\n22, 2o2l.

There are no exceptions. As\ndiscussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the\nWaiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the\nproceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form\n(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-—l74 of March 27,\n2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24\nhours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.\" Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4). The\nCourt will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from\ntoday through July l4, 2o2o. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a\nremote proceeding, the Court finds \"that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]\noutweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\" l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l6l(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss\na potential protective order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in\na manner protective of the rights of third parties.

(Everdell, <span class=\"highlight\">Christian</span>) (Entered: o7/29/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 36 | PROTECTIVE ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell...regarding procedures to be\nfolloued that shall govern the handling of confidential material. SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool978o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019781.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 2l-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65978, Pagell of 25\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

On February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its\nomnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants’ twelve pretrial motions. It filed\nthe brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the\nCourt's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See\nDkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket\non ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file\na leter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding\npages ll28 and l87l88 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2o2l. The\nparties are further ORDERED to meet, confer, and jointly propose redactions to the\nDefendant's cover leter objecting to the Government's proposed redactions by March\n22, 2o2l.

Co—counsel, members of the press, and the public may access the audio feed\nof the proceeding by calling a dial-in number, which the Court will provide in\nadvance of the proceeding by subsequent order. Given the high degree of public\ninterest in this case, a video feed of the remote proceeding will be available for\nviewing in the Jury Assembly Room located at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan\nCourthouse, 5oo Pearl Street, New York, NY. Due to social distancing requirements,\nseating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional persons will\nbe admited. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID—l9 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who\nappears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the\nproceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their\ntemperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions,\natached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon\nentry. Only persons who meet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire\nand whose temperatures are belou loo.4 degrees will be alloued to enter the\ncourthouse. Face coverings that cover the nose and mouth must be worn at all times.\nAnyone who fails to comply with the COVID—l9 protocols that have been adopted by\nthe Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no exceptions. As\ndiscussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the\nWaiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the\nproceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form\n(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-—l74 of March 27,\n2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24\nhours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.\" Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4). The\nCourt will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from\ntoday through July l4, 2o2o. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a\nremote proceeding, the Court finds \"that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]\noutweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\" l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l6l(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss\na potential protective order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in\na manner protective of the rights of third parties.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool98o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019805.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 23, o3/29/2o2l, 3o65988, Pagelo of 24\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the\ndocuments in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of the common\nlaw presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing factors include\nbut are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o (quoting United\nStates v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo II\"), 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995)). The proposed\nredactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that the Defendant's submissions are\n\"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,”\nthereby qualifying as a \"judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the\nLugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995).\nAnd the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access ataches. Id. at\nl46; see also Nixon v. Warner Comme'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 6o2 (l978). As with the\nredactions to her renewed motion for bail, the proposed redactions here are narrouly\ntailored to serve substantial interests, including, most importantly, third parties\npersonal privacy interests. See Under Seal v. Under Seal, 273 F. Supp. 3d 46o, 467\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol7). See also Dkt. No. 95. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket\nthe redacted documents and corresponding exhibits by no later than December 23,\n2o2o. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

In light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially confidential\ninformation that should not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the\nparties 48 hours to propose any redactions to the Courts Opinion and Order and to\njustify those redactions by reference tothe Second Circuits decision in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo(2d Cir. 2oo6). After determining which, if\nany, portions of the Opinion and Order should be redacted, the Court will file the\nOpinion and Order on the public docket. As a result, the Court concludes that the\nGovernment has met its burden of persuasion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and\nthat pretrial detention continues to be warranted. On or before December 3o, 2o2o, the\nparties are ORDERED to submit a joint leter indicating whether they propose any\nredactions and the justification for any such proposal.

On February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its\nomnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants’ twelve pretrial motions. It filed\nthe brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the\nCourt's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See\nDkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket\non ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file\na leter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding\npages ll28 and l87l88 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2o2l.

Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\nUnited States Courthouse\nAO Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\n\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nWe write on behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, to respectfully request that the Court\norder the Bureau of Prisons to give Ms. Maxwell access to the laptop computer provided by the\ngovernment so that she can review discovery on weekends and holidays.\n\nAt the request of defense counsel, the government provided Ms. Maxwell with a laptop\ncomputer to review the voluminous discovery, which was produced on a series of external hard\ndrives. Currently, Ms. Maxwell is given access to the laptop only on weekdays. On weekends\nand holidays, Ms. Maxwell must use the prison computer on her floor to review discovery.\nHouever, the prison computer is not equipped with the software necessary to read large portions\nof the discovery recently produced by the government. As a result, Ms. Maxwell loses several\ndays of review time every weekend and every holiday because she does not have access to the\nlaptop. If Ms. Maxwell is to have any hope of reviewing the millions of documents produced in\ndiscovery so that she can properly prepare her defense by the July l2, 2o2l trial date, she must\nhave access to the laptop every day, including weekends and holidays.\n\nDefense counsel has raised this issue with the government and it has no objection to Ms.\nMaxwell having access to the laptop seven days a week. At the request of defense counsel, the\ngovernment has contacted officials at the MDC on several occasions in the past few weeks to\nrequest that they lift this restriction, but without success.\n\nThere is no principled justification for this restriction. Ms. Maxwell was given access to\nthe laptop every day (including weekends and the Thanksgiving holiday) for the entire l4-day\nperiod that she was quarantined in her isolation cell in November-December 2o2o because she had\ncome into close contact with a member of the MDC staff who had tested positive for COVID. In\naddition, the laptop is kept in a locker in the same room where the prison computer is located, so it\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o268", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020269.jpg": "CaSede2Zot ep C33ouAUNt Dieuten?zia& lFiked Hl6PS/2agPiagef 2 af 2\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJanuary l4, 2o2l\nPage 2\nwould not require any change in Ms. Maxwell’s movements to give her the requested access.\nFurthermore, on at least three occasions since she was released from quarantine, Ms. Maxwell’s\nsecurity team gave her the laptop to review discovery on the weekend.\nThere is clearly no actual impediment preventing the MDC staff from providing Ms.\nMaxwell access to the laptop on weekends and holidays. Given the millions of documents that\nMs. Maxwell must review before trial in order to prepare her defense, it is critical that she be\ngiven as much time as possible with the laptop to review the discovery. We therefore respectfully\nrequest that the Court order the BOP to give Ms. Maxwell access to the laptop on weekends and\nholidays during the hours that she is permited to review discovery.\nSincerely,\n__/s/ <span class=\"highlight\">Christian</span> Everdell _\n<span class=\"highlight\">Christian</span> R.

Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo I\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions.

On February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its\nomnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants’ twelve pretrial motions. It filed\nthe brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the\nCourt's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See\nDkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-—cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket\non ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file\na leter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding\npages ll28 and l87l88 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2o2l. The\nparties are further ORDERED to meet, confer, and jointly propose redactions to the\nDefendant's cover leter objecting to the Government's proposed redactions by March\n22, 2o2l.

On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]...

(Everdell, <span class=\"highlight\">Christian</span>) (Entered: o4/l6/2o2l)\n\no4/l6/2o2l | 2o7 | OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. In June 2o2o, a grand jury returned a\nsix—count indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell with facilitating the late financier\nJeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of minor victims from around l994 to l997. The\nGovernment filed a first (Sl) superseding indictment shortly thereafter, which\ncontained only small, ministerial corrections. The Sl superseding indictment included\ntwo counts of enticement or transportation of minors to engage in illegal sex acts in\nviolation of the Mann Act and two counts of conspiracy to commit those offenses. It\nalso included two counts of perjury in connection with Maxwell's testimony in a civil\ndeposition. Trial is set to begin on July l2, 2o2l. Maxwell filed twelve pretrial\nmotions seeking to dismiss portions of the $l superseding indictment, suppress\nevidence, and compel discovery. After the parties fully briefed those motions, a grand\njury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding a sex trafficking count and\nanother related conspiracy count. This Opinion resolves all of Maxwell's currently\npending pretrial motions other than those seeking to suppress evidence, which the\nCourt will resolve in due course. The motions, and this Opinion, deal exclusively with\nthe Sl superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues related to the newly added\nsex trafficking charges. For the reasons that follou, the Court denies Maxwell's\nmotions to dismiss the $l superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants her\nmotion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further\nexpedite discovery. The Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its\nreasoning on the pages that follou:...[*** See this Opinion & Order ***]...\nConclusion: The Court DENIES Maxwell's motions to dismiss the indictment as\nbarred by Epstein's non—prosecution agreement (Dkt. No. l4l), to dismiss the Mann\nAct counts as barred by the statute of limitations (Dkt. No. l43), to dismiss the\nindictment for pre—indictment delay (Dkt. No. l37), to dismiss the Mann Act counts\nfor lack of specificity (Dkt. No. l23), to dismiss the perjury counts as legally untenable\n(Dkt. No. l35), to strike surplusage (Dkt. No. l45), to dismiss count one or count three\nas multiplicitous (Dkt. No. l2l), and to expedite pretrial disclosures (Dkt. No. l47).\nThe Court GRANTS Maxwell's motion to sever the perjury counts for a separate trial\n(Dkt. No. ll9). The Court ORDERS the Government to confirm within one week\nwhether it considers any evidence related to negotiation of the non—prosecution\nagreement to constitute Brady or Rule l6 material and, if so, to confirm that it has or\nwill disclose such evidence. The Court further ORDERS the parties to negotiate a final\nschedule for all pretrial disclosures that remain outstanding, including: Brady, Giglio,\nand Jenks Act materials, including co—conspirator statements; non-testifying witness\nstatements; testifying witness statements; the identity of victims alleged in the\nindictment; 4o4(b) material; and the Government's witness list. The Court also requires\nthe parties to negotiate a schedule for any additional or supplemental motions briefing\nin light of the S2 indictment. The Court ORDERS a joint proposal to be submited by\nApril 2l, 2o2l. If agreement is not reached, the parties shall submit their respective\nproposals. The Court further ORDERS Maxwell to shou cause by April 2l, 2o2l why\nher motion to dismiss the Sl superseding indictment under the Sixth Amendment (Dkt.\nNo. l25) should not be denied as moot.

The Defendant contends in those motions that the Government\nobtained by subpoena documents covered by a protective order in violation of her\nrights against unreasonable searches and seizures, against self—incrimination, and to\ndue process of law. The motions seek, at minimum, an evidentiary hearing to\ndetermine whether the Government knouingly misrepresented facts to procure an\norder modifying the protective order.

Id. at ll92o. The Court concludes\nthat these are judicial documents and that the First Amendment and common law\npresumptions of access atach. In balancing competing considerations against the\npresumption of access, houever, the Court finds that the specific arguments the\nGovernment has put forward in this leter, including the need to protect the privacy\ninterests of third parties and alleged victims, favor the narrouly tailored redactions.\nSee United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995). The Government's\nleter does not discuss Exhibit L of Reply Brief 6. By April 23, 2o2l, the parties shall\neither propose redactions to Exhibit L of Reply Brief 6, which was originally filed\nunder seal, or they shall indicate to the Court that they seek no redactions and file it on\nECF.

On April 2l, 2o2l, the Court's Chambers received a\nleter from counsel for a non—party requesting assurances as to privacy protections for\nhis client in any filings or proceedings in this case. The leter requests anonymity on\nbehalf of the client as an alleged victim of a sexual crime. After receiving the leter,\nthe Court forwarded it to the parties and required the Government to respond to\ncounsel, which it has done. The Court will take no further action based on the April 2l,\n2o2l leter but will file it under seal to protect the privacy interests of the non—party\nasserting that interest.

Dkt. Nos. 248, 253, 254, 258,\n259. Legal counsel for MDC, where Ms. Maxwell is detained pretrial, alleges that her\nlawyers violated Bureau of Prisons rules by providing Ms. Maxwell materials at an\nin-person atorney—client visit. Dkt. Nos. 254, 259. Ms. Maxwells lawyers\ncategorically deny the allegations and threaten separate legal action against MDC staff\nbased on the incident and the accusation. Dkt. Nos. 253, 258. The Court intimates no\nviews as to whether some other action or process is appropriate or proper in light of\neither sides allegations. This Courts obligation in this case, and any other, is to ensure\nthat the defendant is given an opportunity to meet with her lawyers, engage in\nconfidential atorney—client communications, and prepare for trial. Mindful of that\nobligation, the Court declines to take further action at this time. After receiving the\ndefenses first leter motion, the Court ordered MDC legal counsel to shou cause why\nthe Court should not grant the requested relief. Dkt. No. 249.

For the reasons stated in the\nGovernment's leter, the Court will request November 29, 2o2l from the Clerk's Office\nas the trial start datethat is the date (pending approval from the Clerk's Office\nconsistent with the SDNY COVID protocols) that opening statements will be made to\nthe jury. Houever, the Court will also request from the Clerk's Office that jury\nselection occur during the week of November l5. Counsel shall plan accordingly. The\nCourt grants the Government's motion to exclude time until November 29, 2o2l. The\nCourt finds that the ends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial\ncomputations for the period from today's date through November 29, 2o2l, outweigh\nthe interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is\nnecessary to permit the defense to continue to review discovery and other materials in\nlight of the superseding indictment; to permit the parties to prepare and file motions in\nlimine; to permit the parties to make and review additional pretrial disclosures; and to\nallou adequate time for the parties to prepare for trial. Time is therefore excluded\nunder the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), until November 29, 2o2l. In\norder to ensure that there is no delay in the commencement of trial, the Court will\nadjust the current pre-trial schedule. So that the Court can resolve motions in limine in\nadvance of the November 29th trial commencement date, any such motions shall be\nfully briefed no later than four weeks in advance of the anticipated trial\ncommencement date of November 29. The parties shall meet and confer to propose\nadjustments to other pre-trial disclosures accordingly. The parties are hereby\nORDERED to meet and confer for at least 3o minutes by phone regarding the overall\npretrial disclosure schedule and submit a joint leter by May l4, 2o2l.

The Government has moved for an order requiring\nDavid Markus to comply with Local Criminal Rule 23.l follouing an op-ed that he\nauthored opining on the merits of this pending case. Dkt. No. 3o9. Mr. Markus is\ntherefore ORDERED to comply with Local Criminal Rule 23.l. The Government does\nnot ask the Court to discipline Mr. Markus based on his op—ed and the Court declines\nto consider whether it violated Rule 23.l given the potential lack of clarity with respect\nto whether Mr. Markus was bound by the rule. The Court emphasizes that the rule\nprovides illustrative examples of statements that \"presumptively involve a substantial\nlikelihood that their public dissemination will interfere with a fair trial or otherwise\nprejudice the due administration of justice within the meaning of the rule.\" S.D.N.Y.\nLocal Criminal Rule 23(d). Going forward, Mr. Markus and all lawyers associated\nwith the pending case are nou clearly on notice that their conduct falls under the\npurview of Local Criminal Rule 23.l. Indeed, the above concerns do not apply only to\nMr. Markus. This Court has previously noted that counsel|[,] agents for the parties and\ncounsel for potential witnesses must take care to protect the Defendant's right to a fair\ntrial by an impartial jury. Dkt. No. 28. This Court is cognizant that criminal maters\nheading touard trial are especially sensitive to extrajudicial statements. All those\nassociated with this case must act to ensure the case is tried solely in court or else they\nrisk being deemed responsible for any trial delay or for undermining the integrity of\nthe upcoming trial. See S.D.N.Y. Local Criminal Rule 23.l(h). In addition to the\nimpact it could have on this mater, failure to comply could also result in atorney\ndiscipline. Id. Rule 23.l(4).

Lists for questionnaires\ncompleted on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7.\nLists for questionnaires completed on November l2 will be due to the Court via email\nby November l3. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November l5\nat 9:3o a.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The\nCourt will conduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence\nof the parties and with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides\nindicated the potential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain\ncircumstances. See Transcript at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider\nproposed narrouly tailored measures that may be necessary during voir dire on a\ncase—by—case basis. See id. at l2. The Court will decide in due course whether the\nexercise of peremptory strikes will proceed on November l9 or November 29. The\nCourt implements these procedures taking into account the significant publicity this\ncase has garnered, the nature of the charges, and the District's COVID—l9 protocols.\nThese procedures are carefully balanced and tailored to ensure the safety of the parties\nand prospective jurors in light of the continuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor,\nimpartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the First Amendment right to public access of\ncriminal proceedings. Also for the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the request to seal the parties' proposed questionnaire and voir dire and the\nCourt's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after jury selection is completed is\ndenied. Although the Court has and will continue to implement tailored measures to\nensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see Dkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol,\n232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing the entirety of the proposed\nand draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435\nF.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual voir dire process is designed\nto carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential influence of any pre-trial\nmedia. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to propose for the Court's\nconsideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of the specific factors\nrelated to this case and upcoming trial.

Nos. 372, 373, 375. The Court will\nprovide counsel the corresponding list of juror names and assigned juror numbers on\nNovember l6 at the commencement of voir dire. The placeholder for the juror\ninformation sheet in the Courts draft questionnaire refers to the information sheet\nrequired by the Jury Department. See Dkt. No. 365. The information sheet will be\nremoved and collected by the Jury Department from the packet before the parties\nreview of the questionnaires. The Court is still considering the logistics of when\nperemptory strikes will be exercised, but the Court anticipates peremptory strikes will\nbe exercised on November 29. Assuming so, the swearing in of the jury, preliminary\ninstructions, and opening statements would commence immediately follouing the\nsimultaneous (via submission of lists) exercise of peremptory challenges.

In addition,\nthe Court has determined it will conduct a Daubert hearing with respect to the\nDefendant's motion under Federal Rule of Evidence 7o2.

See\nDkt. No. 38o. The Court will also not permit redactions pertaining to the general\ndescription of evidence or anticipated testimony as such redactions are unnecessary to\nprotect the privacy interests of the individuals implicated.

The Court is in receipt of Defendant's motion for a\nnew trial and accompanying exhibits, which she requests to file under seal. See Dkt.\nNo. 58o. The Court has also received requests from media organizations to unseal the\nmotion. The Court is aware there is substantial public interest in this mater and will\nensure that the First Amendment right to public access is fully safeguarded. At the\nsame time, the Court must act deliberately and hear from the parties in considering\nthese sealing issues in order to ensure the integrity of any potential inquiry process\ngoing forward, should one be ordered. That too is in the public, as well as the\nDefendant's and the Government's, interest. Accordingly, to the extent the Defense\nrequests that arguments in favor of sealing should themselves be sealed, that request is\nDENIED. Arguments in favor of sealing can be made in such a way so as not to\nundermine the grounds for seeking sealing or redaction in the first instance. The\nDefense is therefore ORDERED to file a leter on the public docket on or before\nFebruary l, 2o22, that justifies the proposed sealing by reference to the three—part test\nin Lugosch v.

The Government's opposition to the Defenses new trial\nmotion is due February 2, 2o22. Dkt. No. 57l. Per the established practice in this case,\nthe Government must provide a copy via email to the Defense to allou the Defense the\nopportunity to propose narrouly tailored redactions and/or sealing. If either party\nproposes redactions to or sealing of the Government's anticipated opposition, a leter\njustifying such redactions or sealing must be filed on the public docket. The Defense\nleter must be filed on or before February 8, 2o22, and the Government leter must be\nfiled by February ll, 2o22. The same process will apply for any Defense reply in\nsupport, which is due February 9, 2o22. Dkt. No. 57l. If redactions or sealing are\nproposed, the Defense leter justifying such requests would be due February l5, 2o22,\nand the Government leter would be due February l8, 2o22. The parties are\nFURTHER ORDERED to address the New York Times Company's motion to unseal\nthe filled—out questionnaires for the twelve seated jurors. See Dkt. No. 583.

Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo I\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly\nprepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for\nrelease on bail. SO ORDERED.

On February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its\nomnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants’ twelve pretrial motions. It filed\nthe brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the\nCourt's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See\nDkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-—cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket\non ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file\na leter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding\npages ll28 and l87l88 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2o2l. The\nparties are further ORDERED to meet, confer, and jointly propose redactions to the\nDefendant's cover leter objecting to the Government's proposed redactions by March\n22, 2o2l.

On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]...

(Everdell, <span class=\"highlight\">Christian</span>) (Entered: o4/l6/2o2l)\n\no4/l6/2o2l | 2o7 | OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. In June 2o2o, a grand jury returned a\nsix—count indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell with facilitating the late financier\nJeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of minor victims from around l994 to l997. The\nGovernment filed a first (Sl) superseding indictment shortly thereafter, which\ncontained only small, ministerial corrections. The Sl superseding indictment included\ntwo counts of enticement or transportation of minors to engage in illegal sex acts in\nviolation of the Mann Act and two counts of conspiracy to commit those offenses. It\nalso included two counts of perjury in connection with Maxwell's testimony in a civil\ndeposition. Trial is set to begin on July l2, 2o2l. Maxwell filed twelve pretrial\nmotions seeking to dismiss portions of the $l superseding indictment, suppress\nevidence, and compel discovery. After the parties fully briefed those motions, a grand\njury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding a sex trafficking count and\nanother related conspiracy count. This Opinion resolves all of Maxwell's currently\npending pretrial motions other than those seeking to suppress evidence, which the\nCourt will resolve in due course. The motions, and this Opinion, deal exclusively with\nthe Sl superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues related to the newly added\nsex trafficking charges. For the reasons that follou, the Court denies Maxwell's\nmotions to dismiss the $l superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants her\nmotion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further\nexpedite discovery. The Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its\nreasoning on the pages that follou:...[*** See this Opinion & Order ***]...\nConclusion: The Court DENIES Maxwell's motions to dismiss the indictment as\nbarred by Epstein's non—prosecution agreement (Dkt. No. l4l), to dismiss the Mann\nAct counts as barred by the statute of limitations (Dkt. No. l43), to dismiss the\nindictment for pre—indictment delay (Dkt. No. l37), to dismiss the Mann Act counts\nfor lack of specificity (Dkt. No. l23), to dismiss the perjury counts as legally untenable\n(Dkt. No. l35), to strike surplusage (Dkt. No. l45), to dismiss count one or count three\nas multiplicitous (Dkt. No. l2l), and to expedite pretrial disclosures (Dkt. No. l47).\nThe Court GRANTS Maxwell's motion to sever the perjury counts for a separate trial\n(Dkt. No. ll9). The Court ORDERS the Government to confirm within one week\nwhether it considers any evidence related to negotiation of the non—prosecution\nagreement to constitute Brady or Rule l6 material and, if so, to confirm that it has or\nwill disclose such evidence. The Court further ORDERS the parties to negotiate a final\nschedule for all pretrial disclosures that remain outstanding, including: Brady, Giglio,\nand Jenks Act materials, including co—conspirator statements; non-testifying witness\nstatements; testifying witness statements; the identity of victims alleged in the\nindictment; 4o4(b) material; and the Government's witness list. The Court also requires\nthe parties to negotiate a schedule for any additional or supplemental motions briefing\nin light of the S2 indictment. The Court ORDERS a joint proposal to be submited by\nApril 2l, 2o2l. If agreement is not reached, the parties shall submit their respective\nproposals. The Court further ORDERS Maxwell to shou cause by April 2l, 2o2l why\nher motion to dismiss the Sl superseding indictment under the Sixth Amendment (Dkt.\nNo. l25) should not be denied as moot.

The Defendant contends in those motions that the Government\nobtained by subpoena documents covered by a protective order in violation of her\nrights against unreasonable searches and seizures, against self—incrimination, and to\ndue process of law. The motions seek, at minimum, an evidentiary hearing to\ndetermine whether the Government knouingly misrepresented facts to procure an\norder modifying the protective order.

ENDORSEMENT: The Court grants\nthe Government's proposed redaction and sealing requests. This conclusion is guided\nby the three—part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. The Court concludes\nthat these are judicial documents and that the First Amendment and common law\npresumptions of access atach. In balancing competing considerations against the\npresumption of access, houever, the Court finds that the specific arguments the\nGovernment has put forward in this leter, including the need to protect the privacy\ninterests of third parties and alleged victims, favor the narrouly tailored redactions.\nSee United States v.

On April 2l, 2o2l, the Court's Chambers received a\nleter from counsel for a non—party requesting assurances as to privacy protections for\nhis client in any filings or proceedings in this case. The leter requests anonymity on\nbehalf of the client as an alleged victim of a sexual crime. After receiving the leter,\nthe Court forwarded it to the parties and required the Government to respond to\ncounsel, which it has done. The Court will take no further action based on the April 2l,\n2o2l leter but will file it under seal to protect the privacy interests of the non—party\nasserting that interest.

Dkt. Nos. 248, 253, 254, 258,\n259. Legal counsel for MDC, where Ms. Maxwell is detained pretrial, alleges that her\nlawyers violated Bureau of Prisons rules by providing Ms. Maxwell materials at an\nin-person atorney—client visit. Dkt. Nos. 254, 259. Ms. Maxwells lawyers\ncategorically deny the allegations and threaten separate legal action against MDC staff\nbased on the incident and the accusation. Dkt. Nos. 253, 258. The Court intimates no\nviews as to whether some other action or process is appropriate or proper in light of\neither sides allegations. This Courts obligation in this case, and any other, is to ensure\nthat the defendant is given an opportunity to meet with her lawyers, engage in\nconfidential atorney—client communications, and prepare for trial. Mindful of that\nobligation, the Court declines to take further action at this time. After receiving the\ndefenses first leter motion, the Court ordered MDC legal counsel to shou cause why\nthe Court should not grant the requested relief. Dkt. No. 249.

For the reasons stated in the\nGovernment's leter, the Court will request November 29, 2o2l from the Clerk's Office\nas the trial start datethat is the date (pending approval from the Clerk's Office\nconsistent with the SDNY COVID protocols) that opening statements will be made to\nthe jury. Houever, the Court will also request from the Clerk's Office that jury\nselection occur during the week of November l5. Counsel shall plan accordingly. The\nCourt grants the Government's motion to exclude time until November 29, 2o2l. The\nCourt finds that the ends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial\ncomputations for the period from today's date through November 29, 2o2l, outweigh\nthe interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is\nnecessary to permit the defense to continue to review discovery and other materials in\nlight of the superseding indictment; to permit the parties to prepare and file motions in\nlimine; to permit the parties to make and review additional pretrial disclosures; and to\nallou adequate time for the parties to prepare for trial. Time is therefore excluded\nunder the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), until November 29, 2o2l. In\norder to ensure that there is no delay in the commencement of trial, the Court will\nadjust the current pre-trial schedule. So that the Court can resolve motions in limine in\nadvance of the November 29th trial commencement date, any such motions shall be\nfully briefed no later than four weeks in advance of the anticipated trial\ncommencement date of November 29. The parties shall meet and confer to propose\nadjustments to other pre-trial disclosures accordingly. The parties are hereby\nORDERED to meet and confer for at least 3o minutes by phone regarding the overall\npretrial disclosure schedule and submit a joint leter by May l4, 2o2l.

The Government has moved for an order requiring\nDavid Markus to comply with Local Criminal Rule 23.l follouing an op-ed that he\nauthored opining on the merits of this pending case. Dkt. No. 3o9. Mr. Markus is\ntherefore ORDERED to comply with Local Criminal Rule 23.l. The Government does\nnot ask the Court to discipline Mr. Markus based on his op—ed and the Court declines\nto consider whether it violated Rule 23.l given the potential lack of clarity with respect\nto whether Mr. Markus was bound by the rule. The Court emphasizes that the rule\nprovides illustrative examples of statements that \"presumptively involve a substantial\nlikelihood that their public dissemination will interfere with a fair trial or otherwise\nprejudice the due administration of justice within the meaning of the rule.\" S.D.N.Y.\nLocal Criminal Rule 23(d). Going forward, Mr. Markus and all lawyers associated\nwith the pending case are nou clearly on notice that their conduct falls under the\npurview of Local Criminal Rule 23.l. Indeed, the above concerns do not apply only to\nMr. Markus. This Court has previously noted that counsel|[,] agents for the parties and\ncounsel for potential witnesses must take care to protect the Defendant's right to a fair\ntrial by an impartial jury. Dkt. No. 28. This Court is cognizant that criminal maters\nheading touard trial are especially sensitive to extrajudicial statements. All those\nassociated with this case must act to ensure the case is tried solely in court or else they\nrisk being deemed responsible for any trial delay or for undermining the integrity of\nthe upcoming trial. See S.D.N.Y. Local Criminal Rule 23.l(h). In addition to the\nimpact it could have on this mater, failure to comply could also result in atorney\ndiscipline. Id. Rule 23.l(4).

Accordingly, on or before October l2, 2o2l, the\nparties are ORDERED to confer and submit a joint leter with their best and current\nestimate as to when the jury is likely to begin deliberations.

(jbo) (Entered: lo/25/2o2l)\n\nlo/22/2o2l | 364 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: For the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the Court will implement the follouing procedures for jury selection: A\nscreening questionnaire will be administered on November 4, 5, and l2. The Clerk's\nOffice will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.\nThe list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.\nJurors will be identified on the questionnaire and in court throughout the process by\ntheir assigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed\nto defense counsel by the U.S. Atorney's Office. After reviewing the completed\nquestionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective\njurors that both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense,\nbut not the Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires\ncompleted on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7.\nLists for questionnaires completed on November l2 will be due to the Court via email\nby November l3. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November l5\nat 9:3o a.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The\nCourt will conduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence\nof the parties and with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides\nindicated the potential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain\ncircumstances. See Transcript at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider\nproposed narrouly tailored measures that may be necessary during voir dire on a\ncase—by—case basis. See id. at l2. The Court will decide in due course whether the\nexercise of peremptory strikes will proceed on November l9 or November 29. The\nCourt implements these procedures taking into account the significant publicity this\ncase has garnered, the nature of the charges, and the District's COVID—l9 protocols.\nThese procedures are carefully balanced and tailored to ensure the safety of the parties\nand prospective jurors in light of the continuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor,\nimpartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the First Amendment right to public access of\ncriminal proceedings. Also for the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the request to seal the parties' proposed questionnaire and voir dire and the\nCourt's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after jury selection is completed is\ndenied. Although the Court has and will continue to implement tailored measures to\nensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see Dkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol,\n232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing the entirety of the proposed\nand draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435\nF.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual voir dire process is designed\nto carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential influence of any pre-trial\nmedia. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to propose for the Court's\nconsideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of the specific factors\nrelated to this case and upcoming trial.

The information sheet will be\nremoved and collected by the Jury Department from the packet before the parties\nreview of the questionnaires. The Court is still considering the logistics of when\nperemptory strikes will be exercised, but the Court anticipates peremptory strikes will\nbe exercised on November 29.

The Court is in receipt of Defendant's motion for a\nnew trial and accompanying exhibits, which she requests to file under seal. See Dkt.\nNo. 58o. The Court has also received requests from media organizations to unseal the\nmotion. The Court is aware there is substantial public interest in this mater and will\nensure that the First Amendment right to public access is fully safeguarded. At the\nsame time, the Court must act deliberately and hear from the parties in considering\nthese sealing issues in order to ensure the integrity of any potential inquiry process\ngoing forward, should one be ordered. That too is in the public, as well as the\nDefendant's and the Government's, interest. Accordingly, to the extent the Defense\nrequests that arguments in favor of sealing should themselves be sealed, that request is\nDENIED. Arguments in favor of sealing can be made in such a way so as not to\nundermine the grounds for seeking sealing or redaction in the first instance. The\nDefense is therefore ORDERED to file a leter on the public docket on or before\nFebruary l, 2o22, that justifies the proposed sealing by reference to the three—part test\nin Lugosch v.

The Government's opposition to the Defenses new trial\nmotion is due February 2, 2o22. Dkt. No. 57l. Per the established practice in this case,\nthe Government must provide a copy via email to the Defense to allou the Defense the\nopportunity to propose narrouly tailored redactions and/or sealing. If either party\nproposes redactions to or sealing of the Government's anticipated opposition, a leter\njustifying such redactions or sealing must be filed on the public docket. The Defense\nleter must be filed on or before February 8, 2o22, and the Government leter must be\nfiled by February ll, 2o22. The same process will apply for any Defense reply in\nsupport, which is due February 9, 2o22. Dkt. No. 57l. If redactions or sealing are\nproposed, the Defense leter justifying such requests would be due February l5, 2o22,\nand the Government leter would be due February l8, 2o22.

SO ORDERED: (Signed by Judge\nAlison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o 37 | MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the language,\ntwo areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language allouing her to\npublicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public record to\nthe media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and\ntheir counsel from using discovery materials for any purpose other than preparing for the\ncriminal trial in this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on both of\nthese issues. For the follouing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed\nprotective order Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the\ncourt may, for good cause, deny, restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other\nappropriate relief.\" The good cause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests,\nincluding whether dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others...\nwhether the imposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,” and \"the\npublic's interest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4). First,\nthe Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause with\nregard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged victims and\nwitnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this litigation. As a\ngeneral mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the\nprivacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the\ndisclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging that as a baseline the\nprotective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the\ndefense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity of any alleged victim or\npotential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see also United States v. Corley,\nNo. l3-cr-48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll (S.D.N-Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The\nDefense argues this interest is significantly diminished for individuals who have spoken\non the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because they have voluntarily\nchosen to identify themselves. But not all accusations or public statements are equal.\nDeciding to participate in or contribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a far\ndifferent mater than simply making a public statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or\nJeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a statement might have occurred decades ago and\n\nhtps://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/DktRpt.pl?2llo87ol522l896-L_l_o-l ll/ll3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o633", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020634.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel6 of 2o8\n\n2/22/23, l:25 PM SDNY CM/ECF NextGen Version l.6\nhave no relevance to the charges in this case. These individuals still maintain a significant\nprivacy interest that must be safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad.\nand risks undermining the protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that\nis required by law. In contrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms.\nMaxwell to publicly reference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this\ncase. It also allous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe\nmay be relevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of\nthe investigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter notes,\nsee Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the protective\norder for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the Court on a\ncase-by-case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their\ncounsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case\nare unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented despite the fact that there have been\nmany high-profile criminal maters that had related civil litigation. The Government\nlabors under many restrictions including Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal\nProcedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other policies of the Department of Justice and\nthe U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, all of which the Court\nexpects the Government to scrupulously follou. Furthermore, the Government indicates\nthat it will likely only provide potential witnesses with materials that those witnesses\nalready have in their possession. See Dkt. No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses\nwho do testify at trial would be subject to examination on the record as to what materials\nwere provided or shoun to them by the Government. Nothing in the Defense's papers\nexplains hou its unprecedented proposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a\nfair trial.

On December 8, 2o2o, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nfiled a renewed motion for releaseon bail. Dkt No. 97. In an Opinion and Order\nconcurrently filed under temporary seal, the Court DENIES the Defendant's motion. In\nlight of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially confidential information that should\nnot be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the parties 48 hours to propose\nany redactions to the Courts Opinion and Order and to justify those redactions by\nreference tothe Second Circuits decision in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435\nF.3d llo(2d Cir. 2oo6). After determining which, if any, portions of the Opinion and\nOrder should be redacted, the Court will file the Opinion and Order on the public docket.\nAs a result, the Court concludes that the Government has met its burden of persuasion\nthat the Defendant poses a flight risk and that pretrial detention continues to be\nwarranted. On or before December 3o, 2o2o, the parties are ORDERED to submit a joint\nleter indicating whether they propose any redactions and the justification for any such\nproposal. This resolves Dkt No. 97.

In June 2o2o, a grand jury returned a six-\ncount indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell with facilitating the late financier Jeffrey\nEpstein's sexual abuse of minor victims from around l994 to l997.

It also included two counts of perjury\nin connection with Maxwell's testimony in a civil deposition. Trial is set to begin on July\nl2, 2o2l. Maxwell filed twelve pretrial motions seeking to dismiss portions of the Sl\nsuperseding indictment, suppress evidence, and compel discovery. After the parties fully\nbriefed those motions, a grand jury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding\na sex trafficking count and another related conspiracy count. This Opinion resolves all of\nMaxwell's currently pending pretrial motions other than those seeking to suppress\nevidence, which the Court will resolve in due course. The motions, and this Opinion, deal\nexclusively with the Sl superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues related to\nthe newly added sex trafficking charges. For the reasons that follou, the Court denies\nMaxwell's motions to dismiss the Sl superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants\nher motion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further\nexpedite discovery. The Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its\nreasoning on the pages that follou:...[*** See this Opinion & Order ***]... Conclusion:\nThe Court DENIES Maxwell's motions to dismiss the indictment as barred by Epstein's\nnon-prosecution agreement (Dkt. No. l4l), to dismiss the Mann Act counts as barred by\nthe statute of limitations (Dkt. No. l43), to dismiss the indictment for pre-indictment\ndelay (Dkt. No. l37), to dismiss the Mann Act counts for lack of specificity (Dkt. No.\nl23), to dismiss the perjury counts as legally untenable (Dkt. No. l35), to strike\nsurplusage (Dkt. No. l45), to dismiss count one or count three as multiplicitous (Dkt. No.\nl2l), and to expedite pretrial disclosures (Dkt. No. l47). The Court GRANTS Maxwell's\nmotion to sever the perjury counts for a separate trial (Dkt. No. ll9). The Court\nORDERS the Government to confirm within one week whether it considers any evidence\nrelated to negotiation of the non-prosecution agreement to constitute Brady or Rule l6\nmaterial and, if so, to confirm that it has or will disclose such evidence. The Court further\nORDERS the parties to negotiate a final schedule for all pretrial disclosures that remain\noutstanding, including: Brady, Giglio, and Jenks Act materials, including co-conspirator\nstatements; non-testifying witness statements; testifying witness statements; the identity\nof victims alleged in the indictment; 4o4(b) material; and the Government's witness list.\nThe Court also requires the parties to negotiate a schedule for any additional or\nsupplemental motions briefing in light of the S2 indictment. The Court ORDERS a joint\nproposal to be submited by April 2l, 2o2l. If agreement is not reached, the parties shall\nsubmit their respective proposals. The Court further ORDERS Maxwell to shou cause by\nApril 2l, 2o2l why her motion to dismiss the $l superseding indictment under the Sixth\nAmendment (Dkt. No. l25) should not be denied as moot.

Pyramid Co. of Onondaga,\n435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the\ndocuments in question are \"judicial documents;\" (ll) assess the weight of the common law\npresumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing considerations against\nthe presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. The Court concludes that these are judicial\ndocuments and that the First Amendment and common law presumptions of access atach.\nIn balancing competing considerations against the presumption of access, houever, the\nCourt finds that the specific arguments the Government has put forward in this leter,\nincluding the need to protect the privacy interests of third parties and alleged victims,\nfavor the narrouly tailored redactions.

Dkt. Nos. 275, 276. For the reasons stated in the\nGovernment's leter, the Court will request November 29, 2o2l from the Clerk's Office as\nthe trial start datethat is the date (pending approval from the Clerk's Office consistent\nwith the SDNY COVID protocols) that opening statements will be made to the jury.\nHouever, the Court will also request from the Clerk's Office that jury selection occur\nduring the week of November l5. Counsel shall plan accordingly. The Court grants the\nGovernment's motion to exclude time until November 29, 2o2l. The Court finds that the\nends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial computations for the\nperiod from today's date through November 29, 2o2l, outweigh the interests of the public\nand the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is necessary to permit the defense\nto continue to review discovery and other materials in light of the superseding indictment;\nto permit the parties to prepare and file motions in limine; to permit the parties to make\nand review additional pretrial disclosures; and to allou adequate time for the parties to\nprepare for trial. Time is therefore excluded under the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(7)(A), until November 29, 2o2l. In order to ensure that there is no delay in the\ncommencement of trial, the Court will adjust the current pre-trial schedule. So that the\nCourt can resolve motions in limine in advance of the November 29th trial\ncommencement date, any such motions shall be fully briefed no later than four weeks in\nadvance of the anticipated trial commencement date of November 29. The parties shall\nmeet and confer to propose adjustments to other pre-trial disclosures accordingly. The\nparties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer for at least 3o minutes by phone\nregarding the overall pretrial disclosure schedule and submit a joint leter by May l4,\n2o2l.

Mr. Markus is\ntherefore ORDERED to comply with Local Criminal Rule 23.l.

(jbo) (Entered: lo/25/2o2l)\n\nlo/22/2o2l 364 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: For the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the Court will implement the follouing procedures for jury selection: A\nscreening questionnaire will be administered on November 4, 5, and l2. The Clerk's\nOffice will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.\nThe list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.\nJurors will be identified on the questionnaire and in court throughout the process by their\nassigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed to\ndefense counsel by the U.S. Atorney's Office. After reviewing the completed\nquestionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors\nthat both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense, but not\nthe Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires\ncompleted on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7. Lists\nfor questionnaires completed on November l2 will be due to the Court via email by\nNovember l3. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November l5 at 9:3o\na.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The Court will\nconduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence of the parties\nand with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides indicated the\npotential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain circumstances. See\nTranscript at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider proposed narrouly tailored\nmeasures that may be necessary during voir dire on a case-by-case basis. See id. at l2.\nThe Court will decide in due course whether the exercise of peremptory strikes will\nproceed on November l9 or November 29. The Court implements these procedures\ntaking into account the significant publicity this case has garnered, the nature of the\ncharges, and the District's COVID-l9 protocols. These procedures are carefully balanced\nand tailored to ensure the safety of the parties and prospective jurors in light of the\ncontinuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor, impartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the\nFirst Amendment right to public access of criminal proceedings. Also for the reasons\nstated on the record at yesterday's conference, the request to seal the parties' proposed\nquestionnaire and voir dire and the Court's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after\njury selection is completed is denied. Although the Court has and will continue to\nimplement tailored measures to ensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see\nDkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol, 232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing\nthe entirety of the proposed and draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual\nvoir dire process is designed to carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential\ninfluence of any pre-trial media. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to\npropose for the Court's consideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of\nthe specific factors related to this case and upcoming trial.

The Defense on\nDecember l2, 2o2l, moved to permit three anticipated witnesses to testify under a\npseudonym or their first names only. The Government filed a leter opposing this request\non December l4, 2o2l. The Defense's primary contention is that some form of anonymity\nfor its witnesses is justified by the same reasons that the Court permited three alleged\nvictims and two related government witnesses to testify under pseudonyms. The Court\ndisagrees with this basic premise and denies the Defense's motion....[*** See this\n\nhtps://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/DktRpt.pl?2llo87ol522l896-L_l_o-l 82/ll3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o7o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020705.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Page87 of 2o8\n\n2/22/23, l:25 PM SDNY CM/ECF NextGen Version l.6\nMemorandum Opinion & Order ***]... Last, the Court emphasizes that while it currently\ndenies the Defense's motion, the Defense may of course raise, and the Court will\nconsider, objections that particular lines of questioning into witnesses’ backgrounds or\nlives are irrelevant, cumulative, intended to harass, or otherwise inappropriate. See, e.g.,\nSmith v. Illinois, 39o U.S. l29, l33 (l968) (emphasizing that even when anonymity is not\nwarranted, the court has a duty to protect a witness \"from questions which go beyond the\nbounds of proper cross-examination merely to harass, annoy or humiliate him\").

The Government subsequently submited one court exhibit with the name\nunredacted of a witness subject to the Court's anonymity order. Subsequently the Defense\nindicated in a temporarily sealed leter why the name was unredacted. The Government is\naccordingly ORDERED to docket a leter on ECF on or before January 28, 2o22,\nindicating why a redaction is no longer being sought for the name of this witness. Once\nthe Government confirms in that leter that it no longer seeks redaction of the name, then\nthe Defense may file the temporarily sealed leter on the docket without redaction of the\nname.

The Court is in receipt of Defendant's motion for a\nnew trial and accompanying exhibits, which she requests to file under seal. See Dkt. No.\n58o. The Court has also received requests from media organizations to unseal the motion.\nThe Court is aware there is substantial public interest in this mater and will ensure that\nthe First Amendment right to public access is fully safeguarded. At the same time, the\nCourt must act deliberately and hear from the parties in considering these sealing issues\nin order to ensure the integrity of any potential inquiry process going forward, should one\nbe ordered. That too is in the public, as well as the Defendant's and the Government's,\ninterest. Accordingly, to the extent the Defense requests that arguments in favor of sealing\nshould themselves be sealed, that request is DENIED. Arguments in favor of sealing can\nbe made in such a way so as not to undermine the grounds for seeking sealing or\nredaction in the first instance. The Defense is therefore ORDERED to file a leter on the\npublic docket on or before February l, 2o22, that justifies the proposed sealing by\nreference to the three-part test in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d\nCir. 2oo6). The Government may file on ECF a response to the Defenses justification\nleter on or before February 4, 2o22. The Government's opposition to the Defenses new\ntrial motion is due February 2, 2o22. Dkt. No. 57l. Per the established practice in this\ncase, the Government must provide a copy via email to the Defense to allou the Defense\nthe opportunity to propose narrouly tailored redactions and/or sealing. If either party\nproposes redactions to or sealing of the Government's anticipated opposition, a leter\njustifying such redactions or sealing must be filed on the public docket. The Defense\nleter must be filed on or before February 8, 2o22, and the Government leter must be\nfiled by February ll, 2o22. The same process will apply for any Defense reply in support,\nwhich is due February 9, 2o22. Dkt. No. 57l.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's Rule 29\nmotion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness testimony and\ndocumentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the Defendant's motion based\non constructive amendment or variance because the jury instructions, the Government's\nevidence at trial, and summation all captured the core of criminality charged in the\nIndictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any alleged variance. Further,\nbecause the Government neither intentionally delayed its prosecution nor was the\nDefendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the Defendant's motion based.\non pre-indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the Defendant's motion as to\nmultiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is multiplicitous with Count\nThree, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is multiplicitous with Count\nThree. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the Defendant's participation in\nthe same decade-long unlawful agreement with the Defendant's continuous coconspirator,\nJeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse underage girls. Accordingly, the Court will\nenter judgment of conviction on Counts Three, Four, and Six. The Defendant's sentencing\ndate remains scheduled for June 28, 2o22. The Court previously set a schedule for\nsentencing submissions that remains in effect. Dkt. No. 656. This resolves Dkt. No. 599.\nSO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

See Dkt. No. 698. With one\nexception, the Court concludes that the proposed redactions are narrouly tailored to\nprotect information subject to Fed. R. Evid. 4l2 and the privacy interests of witnesses,\nincluding individuals subject to the Court's pseudonym order, and individuals who were\nanticipated to be called as witnesses at trial, but were not ultimately called. See Lugosch\nv. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court will file unredacted\ncopies of all items under seal. The Court concludes, houever, that the proposed\nredactions to Dkt. No. 725 are not narrouly tailored. The private information of victim-\nwitnesses who are discussed in the leter may be protected by narrou redactions.\nHouever, there is no basis to redact the leter's general request to identify the proper\nscope of cross-examination. Accordingly, the Defendant is ORDERED to confer with the\nGovernment and docket proposed revised redactions on or before l2:oo p.m. on Friday,\nJuly l5, 2o22. The leter at Dkt. No. 725 was filed under temporary seal at Dkt. No. 7l2.\nBecause the Court concludes that sealing in not justified, the Clerk of Court is\nrespectfully directed to strike the entry at Dkt. No. 7l2 from the docket. The Court's\nChambers also received an email from Defense counsel inquiring whether to docket three\njoint leters regarding jury strikes that were previously filed with the Court, but not\ndocketed. Because docketing the leters would not undermine the important interest of\nprotecting juror anonymity and privacy, the parties are ORDERED to docket the three\nleters on or before l2:oo p.m. on Friday, July l5, 2o22. Finally, to ensure a complete\nrecord, the Court has identified four additional documents that have not previously been\ndocketed nor subject of a sealing request: November l9, 2o2l Administrator Feldman's\nMotion to Quash Defendant's Rule l7(c)(3) subpoena, with exhibits November 22, 2o2l\nDefendant's Response to Motions to Quash Defendant's Rule l7(c)(3) subpoena\nDecember 6, 2o2l Jane's Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Call Counsel to Testify\nDecember l5, 2o2l Jane's Opposition to Defendant's December l3, 2o2l Motion to Call\nCounsel to Testify The parties are ORDERED to confer with each other and counsel for\nthe relevant movants and indicate on or before l2:oo p.m. on Friday, July l5, 2o22,\nwhether there are any requests to seal or redact the outstanding documents. Any\ndocuments not subject to a sealing request must be docketed on ECF by that same date.\nAny proposed redactions must be justified by reference to the three-part test articulated\nby the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga. This resolves Dkt. No.\n698. (Signed by Judge Alison J.
