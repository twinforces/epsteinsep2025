Berman\n\nUnited States District Judge\n\nJuly l2, 2ol9\n\nPage 9\narmed private guards atempting to stop the defendant, potentially by force—trather than the\ndefendant being in the environment of a federal facility—also greatly magnifies the danger of the\ndefendant’s flight to the public. See United States v. Boustani, 356 F. Supp. 3d 246, 257 (E.D.N.Y.\n2ol9). “This is why, as the Government correctly notes, federal prisoners should be detained in\nfacilities run by trained <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span> from federal correctional facilities.” /d. at 258 (citing Sabhnani,\n493 F.3d at 74 n.l3 (“To the extent [armed private guards] implies an expectation that deadly force\nmay need to be used to assure defendant['s] presence at trial ... [s}uch a conclusion would, in fact,\ndemand a defendant's detention’”)).\n\nThe Second Circuit has held it is not legal error “for a district court to decline to accept,”\nas “a substitute for detention,” a defendant hiring private security guards to monitor him. United\nStates v. Banki, 369 Fed. App’x l52, l53-54 (2d Cir. 2olo). In the same decision, the Second\nCircuit noted that it was “troubled” by the possibility of “allou[ing] wealthy defendants to buy\ntheir way out by constructing a private jail.” (internal quotation marks omited)). /d.; accord, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Cilins, No. l3 Cr. 3l5 (WHP), 2ol3 WL 38o2ol2, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July l9, 2ol3)\n(““‘it is contrary to underlying principles of detention and release on bail that individuals otherwise\nineligible for release should be able to buy their way out by constructing a private jail, policed by\nsecurity guards not trained or ultimately accountable to the Government, even if carefully\nselected’” (quoting Borodin v. Ashcroft, l36 F. Supp. 2d l25, l34 (E.D.N.Y. 2ool))); Valerio, 9\nF. Supp. 3d at 293-94 (E.D.N.Y. 2ol4) (“There is nothing in the Bail Reform Act that would\nsuggest that a defendant (or even, hypothetically, a group of defendants with private funding) has\na statutory right to replicate or construct a private jail in a home or some other location.”).\n\nThe defendant’s payment of his guards also raises the conflict of interest inherent in having\nthe defendant having extraordinary influence over a private security company tasked with guarding\nhim, leaving the company’s incentives entirely aligned with the defendant. See, e.g., Boustani,\n356 F. Supp. 3d at 257 (in finding that private armed guards would not reasonably assure the\nappearance of a defendant, noting a “clear conflict of interest—private prison guards paid by an\ninmate” and noting that in a recent S.D.N.Y. case involving private security guards the defendant\n“was outside of his apartment virtually all day, every weekday; was visited by a masseuse for a\ntotal of l6o hours in a 3o-day period; and went on an unauthorized visit to a restaurant in\nChinatoun with his private guards in tou”); see also United States v. Tajideen, l7 Cr. o46, 2ol8\nWL l342475, at *5-6 (D.D.C. Mar. l5, 2ol8) (finding Zarrab “particularly instructive” and further\nnoting: “While the Court has no reason to believe that the individuals selected for the defendant's\nsecurity detail would intentionally violate federal law and assist the defendant in fleeing the Court's\njurisdiction, it nonetheless is mindful of the pouer of money and its potential to corrupt or\nundermine laudable objectives. And although these realities cannot control the Court's ruling, they\nalso cannot be absolutely discounted or ignored.”).\n\nFinally, in Zarrab this Court found that “the Defendant’s privately funded armed guard\nproposal is unreasonable because it helps to foster inequity and unequal treatment in favor of a\nvery small cohort of criminal defendants who are extremely wealthy, such as Mr. Zarrab.” 2ol6\nWL 368l423, at *l3; see also Boustani, 356 F.

(Dkt. No. 76). Over the past week, the Government has\nspoken with MDC legal counsel regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement and has tried\nto gather additional information regarding the concerns raised by the defendant, which the\nGovernment has shared with defense counsel. The Government has also conferred with defense\ncounsel three times regarding the same, as well as the defense’s request relating to MDC Warden\nHeriberto Tellez. The parties have been unable to reach agreement. Our respective positions\nfollou.\n\nThe Government respectfully submits that the Court should allou MDC legal counsel to\nrespond directly in writing to the Court and defense counsel regarding the concerns defense\ncounsel has raised relating to the defendant’s conditions of confinement. The Government\nunderstands that MDC legal counsel is prepared to submit a leter by this Friday, December 4,\n2o2o. Such a leter is the appropriate next step at this time, as it will allou the Court to hear\ndirectly from MDC legal counsel who can address the defendant’s conditions of confinement. The\nleter will allou the Court to ascertain whether further inquiry, including a personal appearance by\nthe Warden or other MDC <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span>, is necessary. Moreover, the Government does not\nunderstand the concerns raised by the defense to implicate the defendant’s access to legal materials\nor her ability to communicate with her counsel. As noted in the Government’s leter dated\nNovember 23, 2o2o, the defendant continues to have more time to review her discovery than any\nother inmate at the MDC. The defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC\ninmate to communicate with her atorneys. (Dkt. No. 74).\n\nThe defense disagrees. As communicated to the Government, the defense’s position is as\nfollous: Warden Heriberto Tellez should appear before the Court to directly address concerns\nregarding Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement, which specifically target her. On October\n29, 2o2o, the defense emailed a leter to Warden Tellez detailing the onerous and restrictive\nconditions, including but not limited to concerns regarding the supplemental camera; excessive\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool345\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001520.jpg": "Casese:2@OrroeGGo32IJNo Damtument@ FietO/GR/2 Reagpe22? at B3\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\nUnited States of America\n\nVv.

In accordance with the procedure that Ms.\nMaxwell’s security <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span> had put in place for such an event, Ms. Maxwell moved away\nfrom the windous and into a safe room inside the house.

Ms. Maxwell was not trying\nto avoid arrest; she was simply follouing the established security protocols to protect herself\nfrom what had been informed was an ambush by the press.\n\nRegarding the cellphone wrapped in tin foil, we explained to the Court at the initial\nbail hearing that Ms. Maxwell took this step to prevent the press from accessing her phone\nafter the Second Circuit inadvertently unsealed certain court records with the phone number\nunredacted. (Tr. 55-56). Having nou reviewed the discovery produced by the government,\nit is clear that Ms. Maxwell was not at all the “master spy” the government makes her out to\nbe and was not wrapping the phone in order to evade detection by law enforcement.\n\nFirst, the cellphone in question was subscribed in the name of “Terramar Project,\nInc.,” which is easily identifiable through a simple Google search as Ms. Maxwell’s charity.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell used the phone to make calls as late as May 2o2o, just before her\narrest. She would never have used the phone if she had been concerned that the authorities\nwere using it to track her. Third, Ms. Maxwell had another phone subscribed in the name of\n“G Max” that she was using as her primary phone, which was not covered.

The Department of Justice, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District\n\nof Florida, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nThe Department of Justice (Department) is a cabinet-level executive branch department\nheaded by the United States Atorney General. The stated mission of the Department is to enforce\nfederal law and defend the interests of the United States; ensure public safety; provide federal\nleadership in preventing and controlling crime; seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful\nbehavior; and ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice. The Department enforces\nfederal criminal law through investigations and prosecutions of violations of federal criminal\nstatutes. It also engages in civil litigation. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nDepartment had approximately llo,ooo employees in 4o components. The Department’s\nheadquarters are in Washington, D.C., and it conducts most of its work through field locations\naround the nation and overseas.\n\nThe prosecution of federal criminal laws is handled primarily through 94 U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices, each headed by a presidentially appointed (with advice and consent of the U.S. Senate)\nU.S. Atorney who has independent authority over his or her office but is overseen by the Atorney\nGeneral through the Deputy Atorney General.! The Department’s Criminal Division, headed by\nan Assistant Atorney General, includes components with specialized areas of expertise that also\nprosecute cases, assist in the prosecutions handled by U.S. Atorney’s Offices, and provide legal\nexpertise and policy guidance. Among the Criminal Division components mentioned in this\nReport are the Appellate Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the Computer Crime and\nIntellectual Property Section, and, most prominently, the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section\n(CEOS).\n\nCEOS, based in Washington, D.C., comprises atorneys and investigators who specialize\nin investigating and prosecuting child exploitation crimes, especially those involving technology,\nand they assist U.S. Atorney’s Offices in investigations, trials, and appeals related to these\noffenses.

The main office is in Miami; staffed branch offices are located in Fort Lauderdale,\nWest Palm Beach (covering Palm Beach County), and Fort Pierce; and an unstaffed branch office\nis located in Key West. The West Palm Beach USAO office is approximately 7o miles from the\nMiami office. The USAO is headed by the U.S. Atorney; the second-in-command is the First\nAssistant U.S. Atorney (FAUSA), who serves as principal advisor to the U.S. Atorney and\nsupervises all components of the USAO, including the Criminal, Civil, and Appellate Divisions,\neach of which is headed by a Chief. During the period relevant to this Report, the West Palm\nBeach office consisted of two criminal sections and was headed by a Managing AUSA.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is the principal federal law enforcement agency\nand is part of the Department. It maintains field offices that work with U.S. Atorney’s Offices.\nThe FBI field office in Miami, headed by a Special Agent in Charge, has satellite offices, knoun\nas Resident Agencies, one of which is located in West Palm Beach and covers Palm Beach County.\nThe Epstein investigation was handled by Special Agents assigned to a particular West Palm Beach\nResident Agency squad, headed by a Supervisory Special Agent.

In 2oo6, she was designated as the USAO’s first\ncoordinator for Project Safe Childhood, a new Department initiative focusing on child sexual\nexploitation and abuse.”\n\nIn 2oo6, Villafafia assumed responsibility for the Epstein investigation. As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s compliance with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct. After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking enforcement of their rights\nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l (“the CVRA litigation” or “the\nCVRA case”), in July 2oo8, Villafafia served as co-counsel to the lead atorney representing the\nUSAO until February 2ol9, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.?

She recalled that there was litle higher-level management oversight\neither from the FBI or the USAO, and “we were alloued to do what we needed to do to get our\njob done.” This included continuing to identify, locate, and interview victims and Epstein\nemployees, and obtaining records relating to Epstein’s travel, communications, and financial\ntransactions. The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”\n\n5. October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span>.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.*+ Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\n22 Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\n3 Chapter One, Section III.B of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to . . . change anything.”\n\nam Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nU.S. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3224\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003305.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l29 of 348\nthese victim issues as insurmountable but, based on these alone, the CEOS Trial Atorney\nconsidered a potential prosecution of Epstein to be a “crap shoot.” In addition, she told OPR that\nthere were novel legal issues in the case that also presented difficulties, although she believed these\ndifficulties could be overcome. Shortly after the CEOS Trial Atorney met with the victims,\nhouever, “things just stopped” when Oosterban instructed her to cease her involvement in the\ncase and CEOS engaged in the Criminal Division review sought by Epstein’s defense team.\n\nIX. FEBRUARY — JUNE 2oo8: THE DEPARTMENT’S REVIEW\n\nEpstein’s defense atorneys sought a broad review from the Department, one that would\n\nencompass the defense complaints about federal jurisdiction, specific terms in the NPA, and the\nvarious allegations of professional misconduct by USAO atorneys and other <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span>. The\nDepartment, houever, only reviewed the issue of federal jurisdiction and never reviewed the NPA\nor any specific provisions.'® Nonetheless, the process took several months as the defense\nappealed first to CEOS and the Department’s Criminal Division, and then to the Office of the\nDeputy Atorney General. The chart set forth on the follouing page shous the positions and\nrelationships among the individuals in those offices involved in communicating with the USAO\nor defense beginning in November 2oo7 or in those offices’ reviews, which continued through\nJune 2oo8.\nl62 On February 28, 2oo8, USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior sent to the Civil Rights Division writen\nnotification of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a child exploitation mater” involving Epstein and others “that\nmay result in charges of violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l.” USAM § 8-3.l2o required a U.S. Atorney to notify the\nCivil Rights Division, in writing, “[a]t the outset of a criminal investigation . . . that may implicate federal criminal\ncivil rights statutes, .. . and in no event later than ten days before the commencement of the examination of witnesses\nbefore a grand jury.” The provision also required notification to CEOS in cases involving sex trafficking of minors.\nThe writen notification was to identify the targets of the investigation, the factual allegations to be investigated, the\nstatutes which may have been violated, the U.S. Atorney’s assessment of the significance of the case, whether the\ncase was of “national interest,” and the U.S. Atorney’s proposed staffing of the mater.\n\nVillafafia became aware of this requirement in late February 2oo8, and she prepared a writen notification\nthat was edited by Sloman, who discussed it with Acosta. After briefly summarizing the facts, Senior advised:\n\nThe Office anticipates charges of violations of Title l8, United States Code,\nSections 37l, 2422, 2423, and l59l. The investigation of the case by the City of\nPalm Beach Police Department has resulted in press coverage because of the\ntitillating nature of the facts, but we see this case as similar to other “child\nprostitution” cases charged by our office, and not a mater of “national interest”\nas defined by the U.S. Atorney’s Manual.\n\nIn the notification, Senior stated that CEOS “has been involved and is currently reviewing the mater,” he\nanticipated the case would be staffed by USAO and Department <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span>, and “[i]f we determine that the case should\nbe [charged], a copy [of the charging document] will be forwarded to you.” OPR did not locate a response from the\nCivil Rights Division to the notification.\n\nlo3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003343.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l67 of 348\nto prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.7”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span>. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003352.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l76 of 348\nreconsider the provision. Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely\nif his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s atorneys.\n\nSecond, Epstein himself was not satisfied with the NPA. Immediately after signing the\nagreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the\ninvestigation inappropriate. In addition to repeatedly atacking the NPA in his submissions to the\nDepartment, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of\nmisconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span>. Epstein’s dissatisfaction\nwith the NPA, and his personal atacks on individual prosecutors involved in negotiating the\nagreement, appear inconsistent with a conclusion that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s\nbenefit.\n\nD. OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense\n\nCounsel, Decisions to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors\nEstablished That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided\nImproper Benefits to Epstein\n\nIn evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media\naccounts to shou that the subjects provided improper benefits to Epstein or which purportedly\nsuggested that the subjects acted from improper influences. OPR examined these factors but did\nnot find that they supported a finding that the subjects were influenced by favoritism, bias, or other\nimproper motivation.\n\nl. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any\nImproper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships\nwith His Atorneys\n\nEpstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple atorneys who had preexisting personal\nconnections to some of the government atorneys involved in his case, in the State Atorney’s\nOffice, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department. Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first atorneys who\ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Atorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was\nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former\nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized. Later, when Epstein\nwas seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz, prominent atorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from\nhis previous employment with that firm.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she believed Acosta “was influenced by the stature of Epstein’s\natorneys.” Critically, houever, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in\nthe follouing subsection, neither Villafafia nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed\nidentified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an\nimproper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal relationship with defense counsel (or\nfor any other improper reason). Villafafia explained hou, in her view, the “legal prouess” of\nEpstein’s atorneys had an impact on the case:\n\nl5o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3352\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003357.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8l of 348\naccept the two-year proposal when it was made, but instead continued to press for a sentence of\nhome confinement, suggesting that the defense had not requested the two-year term as a favor and\ndid not view it as such. The defense had previously rejected the state’s offer of a sentence of\nprobation, and there is no indication in the contemporaneous records that Epstein viewed any jail\nsentence favorably and certainly that did not appear to be the view of the defense team in the early\nstages of the negotiations.\n\nAs discussed belou, after extensive questioning of the subjects about the basis for the two-\nyear offer, and a thorough review of the documentary record, OPR was unable to determine the\nreasoning underlying the decision to offer two years as the term of incarceration, as opposed to\nany other term of years. Nonetheless, OPR concludes from the evidence that Acosta was aware of\nand approved the initial offer to the defense, which included the two-year term of incarceration.\nThe only evidence suggesting that the offer of two years stemmed from an improper motivation of\nMenchel’s was a single second-hand statement in an email drafted many years later. Sloman, the\npurported declarant, told OPR that he could not recall whether he made the statement, but he firmly\ndisputed that the email accurately reflected either the reason for the two-year proposal or his\nunderstanding of that reason. Villafafia herself could remember litle about the critical\nconversation with Sloman, including whether she had recorded accurately what Sloman had said.\nGiven the lack of any corroborating evidence, and the evidence shouing Epstein’s vigorous\nresistance to the proposal, OPR concludes that there is no evidence to support the statement in\nVillafafia’s 2ol8 email that Menchel had extended a two-year plea deal as a favor to one of\nEpstein’s atorneys.\n\nE. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects’ Meetings with Defense\n\nCounsel Were Improper Benefits to Epstein\n\nOPR considered whether decisions by Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie to meet with\ndefense counsel while possible charges were under consideration or during the period after the\nNPA was signed and before Epstein entered his state guilty pleas evidenced improper favoritism\ntouard or the provision of an improper benefit to the Epstein defense team.\n\nl. The Evidence Shous That the Subjects’ Decisions to Meet with\nEpstein’s Legal Team Were Warranted by Strategic Considerations\n\nAlthough pre-indictment negotiations are typical in white-collar criminal cases involving\nfinancial crimes, witnesses told OPR that pre-charge meetings with defense counsel are infrequent\nin sex offense cases. As the lead prosecutor, Villafafia vehemently opposed meeting with Epstein’s\natorneys and voiced her concerns to her supervisors, but was overruled by them. In Villafafia’s\nview, the significance of the early meetings granted to the defense team was that, but for those\nmeetings, the USAO would not have offered the disposition set forth in the July 3l, 2oo7 “term\nsheet” and, moreover, “that term sheet would never have been offered to anyone else.”\n\nOPR’s investigation established that while the defense atorneys persistently contacted the\nsubjects through emails, correspondence, and phone calls, relatively few in-person meetings\nactually occurred with the USAO <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span> involved in the mater. As shoun in the chart on the\nfollouing page, while the case was under federal investigation and before the NPA was signed,\nthe subject supervisors and defense counsel had five substantive meetings about the case—\n\nl55\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3357\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003380.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o4 of 348\nwith one of Epstein’s defense atorneys about it. Sloman told OPR during his interview that he\n“vaguely” remembered the computer issue. The documentary evidence confirms that he had at\nleast some contemporaneous knouledge of the issue—when asked by Villafafia whether to put off\na September l2, 2oo7 hearing on the litigation, he told her to do so. Finally, as noted previously,\nthe FBI co-case agent proposed at a meeting with USAO <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span> that the USAO wait until the\nlitigation was resolved before pursuing plea negotiations.\n\nContemporaneous records shou that Acosta was likely aware before the NPA was signed\nof the USAO’s efforts to obtain custody of Epstein’s computers and that after the NPA was signed,\nhe was informed about the use of legal process for obtaining the computer equipment. The NPA\nitself provides that “the federal . . . investigation will be suspended, and all pending [legal process]\nwill be held in abeyance,” that Epstein will withdraw his “motion to intervene and to quash certain\n[legal process],” and, further, that the parties would “maintain . . . evidence subject to [legal\nprocess] that have been issued, and including certain computer equipment, inviolate” until the\nNPA’s terms had been fully satisfied, at which point the legal process would be “deemed\nwithdrawn.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta’s numerous edits on the NPA’s final draft suggest that he\ngave it a close read, and OPR expects that Acosta would not have approved the agreement without\nunderstanding what legal process his office was agreeing to withdraw, or why the only type of\nevidence specified was “certain computer equipment.” In addition, Acosta told OPR that he\nworked closely with Sloman and Menchel, consulted with them, and relied on their counsel about\nthe case. Among other things, Acosta said he discussed with them concerns about the law and the\nevidentiary issues presented by a federal criminal trial. Therefore, although it is possible that\nSloman made the decision to postpone the hearing concerning the USAO’s efforts to obtain the\ncomputer equipment without consulting Acosta, once Acosta reviewed the draft NPA, Acosta was\non notice of the existence of and the ongoing litigation concerning Epstein’s missing computer\nequipment.\n\nVillafafia knew where the computers were; litigation over the demand for the equipment\nwas already underway; there was good reason to believe the computers contained relevant—and\npotentially critical—information; and it was clear Epstein did not want the contents of his\ncomputers disclosed. Nothing in the available record reveals that the USAO benefited from\nabandoning pursuit of this evidence when they did, or that there was any significant consideration\nof the costs and benefits of forgoing the litigation to obtain production of the computers.7™\nInstead, the USAO agreed to postpone and ultimately to abandon its efforts to obtain evidence that\ncould have significantly changed Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation with a state\nguilty plea or led to additional significant federal charges. By agreeing to postpone the litigation,\nthe USAO gave away leverage that might have caused the defense to come to an agreement much\nearlier and on terms more favorable to the government. The USAO ultimately agreed to a term in\nthe NPA that permanently ended the government’s ability to obtain possible evidence of significant\ncrimes and did so with apparently litle serious consideration of the potential cost.\n\n254 If the USAO had significant concerns about its likelihood of prevailing, postponing the litigation to use it as\nleverage in the negotiations might have been strategically reasonable. Lourie suggested in his response to his interview\ntranscript that the court might have precluded production of the computers. Houever, OPR saw no evidence indicating\nthat Villafafia or her supervisors were concerned that the court would do so, and Villafafia had consulted with the\nDepartment’s subject mater experts before initiating her action to obtain the equipment.\nl78\nDOJ-OGR-oooo338o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003387.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ll of 348\nmanagers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.”*’\n\nSecond, key <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span> were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the... bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third\nad In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3387\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003396.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22o of 348\ninformation about available services for victims. Therefore, even\nthough [the Department] may not afford CVRA rights to victims if\ncharges have not been filed in their cases, the [D]epartment may\nprovide certain services to victims that may serve the same function\nas some CVRA rights.?”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines stated that the “prosecution stage” of the case began when “charges\nare filed and continue[d] through postsentencing legal proceedings.” The “U.S. Atorney in whose\ndistrict the prosecution is pending” was responsible for making “best efforts to see that crime\nvictims are notified” of their rights under the CVRA.\n\nDuring the prosecution stage, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the U.S. Atorney, or a\ndesignee, to notify crime victims of case events, such as the filing of charges; the release of an\noffender; the schedule of court proceedings; the acceptance of a guilty plea or nolo contendere or\nrendering of a verdict; and any sentence imposed. The 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to “provide the victim with reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding . . . that involves the crime against the victim.”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult\nwith victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea\nnegotiations, and pretrial diversion. In particular, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views\nabout, prospective plea negotiations. Nevertheless, the 2oo5 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a conviction. Depending on the agency having custody of the defendant, the U.S.\nAtorney or other agencies were responsible for victim notifications during this stage.\n\nIV.

Three victims\nwere notified shortly after the signing of the [NPA] of the general\nterms of that Agreement. You raised objections to any victim\nnotification, and no further notifications were done. Throughout\nthis process you have seen that I have prepared this case as though\nit would proceed to trial. Notifying the witnesses of the possibility\nof damages claims prior to concluding the mater by plea or trial\nwould only undermine my case. If my reassurances are insufficient\nthe fact that not a single victim has threatened to sue Mr. Epstein\nshould assure you of the integrity of the investigation.\n\nOn December l4, 2oo7, Villafafia forwarded to Acosta the draft victim notification leter\npreviously sent to the defense, along with two draft leters addressed to State Atorney Krischer;\nVillafafia’s transmital email to Acosta had the subject line, “The leters you requested.” One of\nthe draft leters to Krischer, to be signed by Villafafia, was to advise that the USAO had sent an\nenclosed victim notification leter to specified identified victims and referred to an enclosed “list\nof the identified victims and their contact information, in case you are required to provide them\nwith any further notification regarding their rights under Florida law.”*\"? The second draft leter\nto Krischer, for Acosta’s signature, requested that Krischer respond to defense counsel’s\nallegations that the State Atorney’s Office was not comfortable with the proposed plea and\nsentence because it believed that the case should be resolved with probation and no sexual offender\nregistration. OPR found no evidence that these leters were sent to Krischer.*”°\n\nA few days later, in an apparent effort to move forward with victim notifications, Villafafia\nemailed Sloman, stating, “[Is there] anything that I or the agents should be doing?” Villafafia told\nSloman that “[the FBI case agent] is all worked up because another agent and [a named AUSA]\nare the subject of an OPR investigation for failing to properly confer with and notify victims [in\nan unrelated mater]. We seem to be in a Catch 22.7! OPR did not find a response to Villafafia’s\nemail.\n\nIn their December l4, 2oo7 meeting with Acosta and other USAO <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span> and in their\nlengthy follou-up leter to Acosta on December l7, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz continued to press\ntheir objections to the USAO’s involvement in the Epstein mater. They requested that Acosta\n3l9 The draft victim notification leter was identical to the draft victim notification leter sent to the defense on\nDecember 6, 2oo7, except that it contained a new plea date of January 4, 2oo8.\n\n32o Moreover, the leters were not included in the publicly released State Atorney’s file, which included other\ncorrespondence from the USAO. See Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office Public Records/Jeffrey Epstein, available\nat htp://sal5.org/stateatorney/NewsRoom/indexPR htm.\n\n32l OPR was unable to locate any records indicating that such allegations had ever been referred to OPR.\nVillafafia told OPR that “Catch 22” was a reference to instructions from supervisors “[t]hat we can’t go forward on”\nfiling federal charges and “I was told not to do victim notifications and confer at the time.”\n\n2l7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003420.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 244 of 348\nreview the appropriateness of the potential federal charges and the government’s “unprecedentedly\nexpansive interpretation” of l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn a December l9, 2oo7 response to the defense team, Acosta offered to revise two\nparagraphs in the NPA to resolve “disagreements” with the defense and to clarify that the parties\nintended Epstein’s § 2255 liability to “place these identified victims in the same position as they\nwould have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.” Acosta also advised\nthat although the USAO intended to notify the victims of the resolution of the federal investigation,\nthe USAO would leave to the State Atorney the decision whether to notify victims about the state\nproceedings:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court sentencing\nhearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim notification leter and\nthe statute. I would note that the United States provided the draft\nleter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition, First Assistant United\nStates Atorney Sloman already incorporated in the leter several\nedits that had been requested by defense counsel. I agree that [the\nCVRA| applies to notice of proceedings and results of investigations\nof federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We intend to provide\nvictims with notice of the federal resolution, as required by law. We\nwill defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding whether\nhe wishes to provide victims with notice of the state proceedings,\nalthough we will provide him with the information necessary to do\nso if he wishes.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this leter without running it by [Sloman], if\nnot other individuals in the office,” and records shou he sent a draft to Sloman and Villafafia.\nAcosta explained to OPR that he was not concerned about deferring to Krischer on the issue of\nwhether to notify the victims of the state proceedings because he did not view it as his role, or the\nrole of the USAO, “to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to the state\noutcome.”*” Acosta further explained to OPR that despite the USAO’s initial concerns about the\nState Atorney’s Office’s handling of the Epstein case, he did not believe it was appropriate to\nquestion that office’s ability to “fulfill whatever obligation they have,” and he added, “Let’s not\nassume .. . that the State Atorney’s Office is full of bad actors.” Acosta told OPR that it was his\nunderstanding “that the victims would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have\nan opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.” Acosta also told OPR that the state would\n322 Sloman’s handwriten notes from a December 2l, 2oo7 telephone conference indicate that Acosta asked the\ndefense, “Are there concerns re: 377l lang[uage],” to which Lefkouitz replied, “The state should have their oun\nmechanism.” At the time of the Epstein mater, under the Florida Constitution, upon request, victims were afforded\nthe “right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of, and to be present at” a defendant’s plea and sentencing. Fla.\nConst. art. I, § l6(b)(6). Similarly, pursuant to state statute, “Law enforcement <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span> shall ensure” that victims\nare given information about “[t]he stages in the criminal or juvenile justice process which are of significance to the\nvictim[.]” Fla.

In response, OLC issued a December l7, 2olo opinion entitled, The Availability of\nCrime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4. Based on the CVRA’s\nlanguage, relevant case law, and memoranda opinions from Department components, OLC\nreaffirmed its 2oo5 conclusion that CVRA rights do not vest until a criminal charge has been filed\n(by complaint, information, or indictment) and the rights cease to be available if “all charges are\ndismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or if the [g]overnment declines to bring formal\ncharges after the filing of a complaint).”?”\n\nAfter OLC issued its opinion, the Department revised the 2oo5 Guidelines in October 2oll\nbut did not change its fundamental position that the CVRA rights did not vest until after criminal\ncharges were filed. The 2oll revision did, houever, add language concerning victim consultation\nbefore a defendant is charged: “In circumstances where plea negotiations occur before a case has\nbeen brought, Department policy is that this should include reasonable consultation prior to the\nfiling of a charging instrument with the court.”*” The use of the word “should” in the 2oll\nGuidelines indicates that “<span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span> are expected to take the action . . . unless there is an\nappropriate, articulable reason not to do so.”°°° Nevertheless, the required consultation “may be\ngeneral in nature” and “does not have to be specific to a particular plea offer.”°*! The revisions\nalso specified that AUSAs were to ensure that victims had a right to be reasonably heard at plea\nproceedings.**\n\nOn November 2, 2oll, U.S. Senator Jon Kyl, a co-sponsor of the CVRA, sent a leter to\nAtorney General Eric Holder, arguing that the 2oll Guidelines revisions “conflict[ed] quite\nclearly with the CVRA’s plain language” because the 2oll Guidelines did “not extend any rights\nto victims until charges have been filed.” The Department’s response emphasized that the\n378 OLC “express[ed] no opinion” as to whether it is a mater of “good practice” to inform victims of their CVRA\nrights prior to the filing of a complaint or after the dismissal of charges.\nae See 2oll Guidelines, Art. V, § G.2, available at htps://(www_justice.gov/sites/default/files/olp/docs/\nag guidelines2ol2. pdf. In its 2oll online training video regarding the Guidelines, the Department encouraged such\nconsultation when reasonable, but it also continued to maintain that there was no CVRA right to confer for pre-\nindictment plea negotiations.\n\n38o See 2oll Guidelines, Art. I, J B.2.\n58 See 2oll Guidelines, Art. V, J G.2.\n382 The 2oo5 Guidelines contained no specific provision requiring AUSAs to ensure that victims were able to\nexercise their right to be reasonably heard at plea proceedings, only at sentencing. See 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV,\n4 C.3.b.(2). Houever, the 2oo5 Guidelines generally require AUSAs to use their best efforts to comply with the\nCVRA, and the CVRA specifically affords victims the right to be heard at plea proceedings.

Consultation With a Government Atorney\n\n(l) In General. A victim has the reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the\nGovernment in the case. The victim’s right to confer, houever, shall not be\nconstrued to impair prosecutorial discretion. Federal prosecutors should be\navailable to consult with victims about major case decisions, such as dismissals,\nrelease of the accused pending judicial proceedings (when such release is for\nnoninvestigative purposes), plea negotiations, and pretrial diversion. Because\nvictims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government, and may disclose\nwhatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only\nnonsensitive data and public information. Consultations should comply with the\nprosecutor’s obligations under applicable rules of professional conduct.\nRepresentatives of the Department should take care to inform victims that neither\nthe Department’s advocacy for victims nor any other effort that the Department\nmay make on their behalf constitutes or creates an atorney-client relationship\nbetween such victims and the lawyers for the Government.\nDepartment <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span> should not provide legal advice to victims.\n(2) Prosecutor Availability. Prosecutors should be reasonably available to consult\nwith victims regarding significant adversities they may suffer as a result of delays\nin the prosecution of the case and should, at the appropriate time, inform the court\nof the reasonable concerns that have been conveyed to the prosecutor.\n(3) Proposed Plea Agreements. Responsible officials should make reasonable\nefforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about,\nprospective plea negotiations. In determining what is reasonable, the responsible\nofficial should consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving\nnotice and considering views in the context of the particular case, including, but not\nlimited to, the follouing factors:\n\n(a) The impact on public safety and risks to personal safety.\n\n(b) The number of victims.\n\n(c) Whether time is of the essence in negotiating or entering a proposed plea.\n\n252\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3454\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003472.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 296 of 348\nthe PBPD during its investigation into Epstein’s conduct. Absent information from the USAO,\nthe state would not have been in a position to notify those additional victims of the state plea\nproceeding, even if the State Atorney had decided to include other victims identified during the\nstate investigation. Furthermore, at the time he made his decision, Acosta had already been advised\nby Villafafia that Belohlavek, in November 2oo7, had requested that the USAO notify victims,\npresumably those identified during the federal investigation, about the state plea hearing.\n\nAcosta told OPR that it had been his understanding at the time of Epstein’s plea that the\nvictims would be made aware of the proceeding and would have an opportunity to speak. Acosta\nalso told OPR that he expected the state would have “notified [the victims] that that was an all-\nencompassing plea, that the state court sentence would also mean that the federal government was\nnot proceeding.” There is no evidence, houever, that he verified this understanding with Sloman\nor Villafafia, let alone the State Atorney. OPR found no indication that Acosta ever\ncommunicated, or directed Sloman or Villafafia to communicate, his decision to the State Atorney\nor to provide the State Atorney’s Office with a complete list of victims identified during the\nfederal investigation. OPR located a draft leter to the State Atorney’s Office that Villafafia\nprepared and forwarded to Acosta in December 2oo7, which did provide such information, but\nOPR found no evidence that the leter was ever sent, and it was not among materials publicly\nreleased from the State Atorney’s Office.*** OPR also found evidence that both Sloman and\nVillafafia interacted with the State Atorney’s Office in the months leading up to the June 3o, 2oo8\nplea hearing, but there is no indication that they discussed victim notification issues with that\noffice, and Villafafia’s last minute request to PBPD Chief Reiter to notify victims indicates that\nthe USAO had not coordinated with the State Atorney’s Office. Belohlavek told OPR that no one\nfrom the USAO provided her with a list of victims or coordinated any notification of victims to\nappear at the hearing.\n\nKrischer and Belohlavek were thus evidently unaware that Acosta had decided to leave it\nto them to decide whether to notify victims about the state proceeding. In the absence of some\ndiscussion of which or hou many victims the state intended to notify, what the state intended to\ntell them about Epstein’s plea, and whether the state intended to let the victims speak at the plea\nhearing, Acosta had no way to ensure that his assumption about victim notification was accurate.\nIn other words, Acosta failed to plan for hou all of the identified victims of Epstein’s crimes, both\nfederal and state, “would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have an\nopportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\n\nOPR did not find evidence that Acosta acted for the purpose of excluding victims from the\nplea hearing, and Acosta’s assumption that the state would handle victim notification appropriately\nwas not unsupported. State prosecutors are subject to victim notification requirements under the\nFlorida Constitution, and the state prosecution offices have victim witness <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span>, resources,\nand processes to help accomplish notification. Houever, Acosta was aware—through the\nprosecution memoranda, the draft indictment, and email communications from Villafafia—that the\nUSAO’s investigation had expanded beyond those victims identified in the original PBPD\n424 The text of the leter indicated that Epstein’s atorneys asked the USAO not to inform victims of “any rights\nthey may have as victims of the charges filed by the State Atorney’s Office” and that the USAO was providing the\nState Atorney’s Office with a list of the 33 identified federal victims “in case you are required to provide them with\nany further notification regarding their rights under Florida law.”\n\n27o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3472\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003484.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o8 of 348\nto be paid to the FBI’s communications to ensure that the victims were receiving accurate and\ntimely information that was consistent with the status of the case and with the USAO’s\ncommunications with victims.*4”\n\nThe decision not to inform victims and their atorneys about the existence of the NPA gave\nvictims and the public the misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel\nto keep the agreement secret from the victims. Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span> have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“48 For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities. In certain cases, such as the\nEpstein case, prosecutors may need to provide more oversight when multiple Department\ncomponents are communicating with victims to avoid providing confusing and contradictory\nmessages.\nindependent of the NPA provision. OPR also notes that impeachment regarding the NPA provision may have\npermited the government to rehabilitate the victims through their prior statements to law enforcement. In other words,\nwhile the USAO’s view concerning potential impeachment was not unreasonable, more extensive consideration of the\ncase agent’s concerns might have led the prosecutors to conclude that the risk of the information being used to\nsignificantly damage the credibility of the victims was lou.\n\nHe In addition to the FBI leters previously discussed, another example of the inconsistent communication can\nbe seen in leters that were to be sent after Epstein entered his guilty plea to two victims residing in foreign countries.\nAlthough OPR was unable to confirm that the two victims actually received the leters, it appears from the records\nOPR reviewed that the government intended to provide them with a standard FBI leter stating that the case was under\ninvestigation while also providing them with a USAO leter stating that the case had been resolved through Epstein’s\nstate guilty plea.\n\n448 OPR understands that the Department is in the process of revising the 2oll Guidelines.\n\n282\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3484\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003485.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o9 of 348\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span>; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation.

Subjects\nOPR requested that all five subjects provide writen responses detailing their involvement\nin the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions\nrelating to victim notification and consultation. In addition, OPR conducted extensive interviews\nof each subject under oath and before a court reporter. Each subject was represented by counsel\nand had access to relevant contemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview. The\nsubjects reviewed and provided comments on their interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report.\n2.

Communications with Victims and Victims’ Atorneys\nOPR contacted atorneys knoun to represent 26 victims among the 3o surviving individuals\nwho were identified in the USAO’s July 2oo8 listing of 32 victims the USAO was prepared to\ninclude in federal charges against Epstein and who accordingly were entitled to the benefits of the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 monetary damages provision of the NPA.

(4/2/2l Leter from Def., Dkt. No. 244 at 9). As to the former, there is no probative\nvalue in shouing that diary entries before the defendant had ever met Epstein or the defendant\ncontain no references to Epstein or the defendant, and in any event, the Government has conceded\nthe point. As to the later, the defendant offers only the conclusory statement that review of the\nentire diary is necessary.

THE FEDERAL AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES\n\nA. The Department of Justice, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District\n\nof Florida, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nThe Department of Justice (Department) is a cabinet-level executive branch department\nheaded by the United States Atorney General. The stated mission of the Department is to enforce\nfederal law and defend the interests of the United States; ensure public safety; provide federal\nleadership in preventing and controlling crime; seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful\nbehavior; and ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice. The Department enforces\nfederal criminal law through investigations and prosecutions of violations of federal criminal\nstatutes. It also engages in civil litigation. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nDepartment had approximately llo,ooo employees in 4o components. The Department’s\nheadquarters are in Washington, D.C., and it conducts most of its work through field locations\naround the nation and overseas.\n\nThe prosecution of federal criminal laws is handled primarily through 94 U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices, each headed by a presidentially appointed (with advice and consent of the U.S. Senate)\nU.S. Atorney who has independent authority over his or her office but is overseen by the Atorney\nGeneral through the Deputy Atorney General.! The Department’s Criminal Division, headed by\nan Assistant Atorney General, includes components with specialized areas of expertise that also\nprosecute cases, assist in the prosecutions handled by U.S. Atorney’s Offices, and provide legal\nexpertise and policy guidance. Among the Criminal Division components mentioned in this\nReport are the Appellate Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the Computer Crime and\nIntellectual Property Section, and, most prominently, the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section\n(CEOS).\n\nCEOS, based in Washington, D.C., comprises atorneys and investigators who specialize\nin investigating and prosecuting child exploitation crimes, especially those involving technology,\nand they assist U.S. Atorney’s Offices in investigations, trials, and appeals related to these\noffenses. CEOS provides advice and training to federal prosecutors, law enforcement <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span>,\nand government officials. CEOS also works to develop and refine proposals for prosecution\npolicies, legislation, government practices, and agency regulations.\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) (revised in 2ol8 and renamed the Justice Manual)\nis a compilation of Department rules, policies, and guidance governing the conduct of Department\nemployees.

In this Report, OPR applies the USAM provisions in effect at the relevant time.\n\nDuring the period most relevant to this Report, the Atorney General was Michael\nMukasey, the Deputy Atorney General was Mark Filip, and the Assistant Atorney General for\nthe Criminal Division was Alice Fisher. The Chief of CEOS was Andrew Oosterban.\n\nThe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (USAO) handles federal\nmaters in the Southern District of Florida judicial district, which covers the counties of Miami-\nDade, Brouard, Monroe, Palm Beach, Martin, St. Lucie, Indian River, Okeechobee, and\nHighlands, an area of over l5,ooo square miles. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nUSAO had a staff of approximately 2oo Assistant U.S. Atorneys (AUSAs) and 2oo support\n<span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span>. The main office is in Miami; staffed branch offices are located in Fort Lauderdale,\nWest Palm Beach (covering Palm Beach County), and Fort Pierce; and an unstaffed branch office\nis located in Key West. The West Palm Beach USAO office is approximately 7o miles from the\nMiami office. The USAO is headed by the U.S. Atorney; the second-in-command is the First\nAssistant U.S. Atorney (FAUSA), who serves as principal advisor to the U.S. Atorney and\nsupervises all components of the USAO, including the Criminal, Civil, and Appellate Divisions,\neach of which is headed by a Chief. During the period relevant to this Report, the West Palm\nBeach office consisted of two criminal sections and was headed by a Managing AUSA.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is the principal federal law enforcement agency\nand is part of the Department. It maintains field offices that work with U.S. Atorney’s Offices.\nThe FBI field office in Miami, headed by a Special Agent in Charge, has satellite offices, knoun\nas Resident Agencies, one of which is located in West Palm Beach and covers Palm Beach County.\nThe Epstein investigation was handled by Special Agents assigned to a particular West Palm Beach\nResident Agency squad, headed by a Supervisory Special Agent.

She served\nin the Major Crimes Section in Miami until January 2oo4, when she transferred to the West Palm\nBeach branch office. Villafafia handled the majority of the child exploitation cases in West Palm\nBeach, along with other criminal maters. In 2oo6, she was designated as the USAO’s first\ncoordinator for Project Safe Childhood, a new Department initiative focusing on child sexual\nexploitation and abuse.”\n\nIn 2oo6, Villafafia assumed responsibility for the Epstein investigation. As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s compliance with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct. After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking enforcement of their rights\nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l (“the CVRA litigation” or “the\nCVRA case”), in July 2oo8, Villafafia served as co-counsel to the lead atorney representing the\nUSAO until February 2ol9, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.?

Led by the U.S. Atorneys’ Offices\nand CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state, and local resources to locate, apprehend, and prosecute\nindividuals who exploit children via the internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims.\n\n3 After the district court issued its February 2l, 2ol9 opinion finding misconduct on the part of the government,\nthe Department re-assigned the CVRA case to the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo433o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004346.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 49 of 349\nalso informed Sloman and Lourie that the FBI was re-interviewing victims who had given taped\nstatements to the PBPD, to ensure their stories “have not changed,” and that “[a]ny discrepancies\nwill be noted and considered.” She conceded that “[g]eting them to tell their stories in front of a\njury at trial may be much harder,” but expressed confidence that the two key victims “will stay the\ncourse.” She acknouledged that the case “needs to be rock solid.”\n\nThe case agent told OPR that in this initial stage of the investigation, the FBI “partnered\nup very well” with the USAO. She recalled that there was litle higher-level management oversight\neither from the FBI or the USAO, and “‘we were alloued to do what we needed to do to get our\njob done.” This included continuing to identify, locate, and interview victims and Epstein\nemployees, and obtaining records relating to Epstein’s travel, communications, and financial\ntransactions. The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”\n\n5. October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span>.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.*+ Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\n22 Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\n3 Chapter One, Section IIIB of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to... change anything.”\n\nam Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nU.S. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4346\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004427.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l3o of 349\nthese victim issues as insurmountable but, based on these alone, the CEOS Trial Atorney\nconsidered a potential prosecution of Epstein to be a “crap shoot.” In addition, she told OPR that\nthere were novel legal issues in the case that also presented difficulties, although she believed these\ndifficulties could be overcome. Shortly after the CEOS Trial Atorney met with the victims,\nhouever, “things just stopped” when Oosterban instructed her to cease her involvement in the\ncase and CEOS engaged in the Criminal Division review sought by Epstein’s defense team.\n\nIX. FEBRUARY —- JUNE 2oo8: THE DEPARTMENT’S REVIEW\n\nEpstein’s defense atorneys sought a broad review from the Department, one that would\n\nencompass the defense complaints about federal jurisdiction, specific terms in the NPA, and the\nvarious allegations of professional misconduct by USAO atorneys and other <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span>. The\nDepartment, houever, only reviewed the issue of federal jurisdiction and never reviewed the NPA\nor any specific provisions.'®” Nonetheless, the process took several months as the defense\nappealed first to CEOS and the Department’s Criminal Division, and then to the Office of the\nDeputy Atorney General. The chart set forth on the follouing page shous the positions and\nrelationships among the individuals in those offices involved in communicating with the USAO\nor defense beginning in November 2oo7 or in those offices’ reviews, which continued through\nJune 2oo8.\nl62 On February 28, 2oo8, USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior sent to the Civil Rights Division writen\nnotification of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a child exploitation mater” involving Epstein and others “that\nmay result in charges of violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l.” USAM § 8-3.l2o required a U.S. Atorney to notify the\nCivil Rights Division, in writing, “[a]t the outset of a criminal investigation . . . that may implicate federal criminal\ncivil rights statutes, .. . and in no event later than ten days before the commencement of the examination of witnesses\nbefore a grand jury.” The provision also required notification to CEOS in cases involving sex trafficking of minors.\nThe writen notification was to identify the targets of the investigation, the factual allegations to be investigated, the\nstatutes which may have been violated, the U.S. Atorney’s assessment of the significance of the case, whether the\ncase was of “national interest,” and the U.S. Atorney’s proposed staffing of the mater.\n\nVillafafia became aware of this requirement in late February 2oo8, and she prepared a writen notification\nthat was edited by Sloman, who discussed it with Acosta. After briefly summarizing the facts, Senior advised:\n\nThe Office anticipates charges of violations of Title l8, United States Code,\nSections 37l, 2422, 2423, and l59l. The investigation of the case by the City of\nPalm Beach Police Department has resulted in press coverage because of the\ntitillating nature of the facts, but we see this case as similar to other “child\nprostitution” cases charged by our office, and not a mater of “national interest”\nas defined by the U.S. Atorney’s Manual.\n\nIn the notification, Senior stated that CEOS “has been involved and is currently reviewing the mater,” he\nanticipated the case would be staffed by USAO and Department <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span>, and “[i]f we determine that the case should\nbe [charged], a copy [of the charging document] will be forwarded to you.” OPR did not locate a response from the\nCivil Rights Division to the notification.\n\nlo3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4427\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004465.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l68 of 349\nto prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span>. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4465\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004474.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l77 of 349\nreconsider the provision. Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely\nif his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s atorneys.\n\nSecond, Epstein himself was not satisfied with the NPA. Immediately after signing the\nagreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the\ninvestigation inappropriate. In addition to repeatedly atacking the NPA in his submissions to the\nDepartment, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of\nmisconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span>. Epstein’s dissatisfaction\nwith the NPA, and his personal atacks on individual prosecutors involved in negotiating the\nagreement, appear inconsistent with a conclusion that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s\nbenefit.\n\nD. OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense\n\nCounsel, Decisions to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors\nEstablished That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided\nImproper Benefits to Epstein\n\nIn evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media\naccounts to shou that the subjects provided improper benefits to Epstein or which purportedly\nsuggested that the subjects acted from improper influences. OPR examined these factors but did\nnot find that they supported a finding that the subjects were influenced by favoritism, bias, or other\nimproper motivation.\n\nl. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any\nImproper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships\nwith His Atorneys\n\nEpstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple atorneys who had preexisting personal\nconnections to some of the government atorneys involved in his case, in the State Atorney’s\nOffice, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department. Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first atorneys who\ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Atorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was\nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former\nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized. Later, when Epstein\nwas seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz, prominent atorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from\nhis previous employment with that firm.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she believed Acosta “was influenced by the stature of Epstein’s\natorneys.” Critically, houever, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in\nthe follouing subsection, neither Villafafia nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed\nidentified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an\nimproper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal relationship with defense counsel (or\nfor any other improper reason). Villafafia explained hou, in her view, the “legal prouess” of\nEpstein’s atorneys had an impact on the case:\n\nl5o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4474\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004479.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l82 of 349\naccept the two-year proposal when it was made, but instead continued to press for a sentence of\nhome confinement, suggesting that the defense had not requested the two-year term as a favor and\ndid not view it as such. The defense had previously rejected the state’s offer of a sentence of\nprobation, and there is no indication in the contemporaneous records that Epstein viewed any jail\nsentence favorably and certainly that did not appear to be the view of the defense team in the early\nstages of the negotiations.\n\nAs discussed belou, after extensive questioning of the subjects about the basis for the two-\nyear offer, and a thorough review of the documentary record, OPR was unable to determine the\nreasoning underlying the decision to offer two years as the term of incarceration, as opposed to\nany other term of years. Nonetheless, OPR concludes from the evidence that Acosta was aware of\nand approved the initial offer to the defense, which included the two-year term of incarceration.\nThe only evidence suggesting that the offer of two years stemmed from an improper motivation of\nMenchel’s was a single second-hand statement in an email drafted many years later. Sloman, the\npurported declarant, told OPR that he could not recall whether he made the statement, but he firmly\ndisputed that the email accurately reflected either the reason for the two-year proposal or his\nunderstanding of that reason. Villafafia herself could remember litle about the critical\nconversation with Sloman, including whether she had recorded accurately what Sloman had said.\nGiven the lack of any corroborating evidence, and the evidence shouing Epstein’s vigorous\nresistance to the proposal, OPR concludes that there is no evidence to support the statement in\nVillafafia’s 2ol8 email that Menchel had extended a two-year plea deal as a favor to one of\nEpstein’s atorneys.\n\nE. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects’ Meetings with Defense\n\nCounsel Were Improper Benefits to Epstein\n\nOPR considered whether decisions by Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie to meet with\ndefense counsel while possible charges were under consideration or during the period after the\nNPA was signed and before Epstein entered his state guilty pleas evidenced improper favoritism\ntouard or the provision of an improper benefit to the Epstein defense team.\n\nl. The Evidence Shous That the Subjects’ Decisions to Meet with\nEpstein’s Legal Team Were Warranted by Strategic Considerations\n\nAlthough pre-indictment negotiations are typical in white-collar criminal cases involving\nfinancial crimes, witnesses told OPR that pre-charge meetings with defense counsel are infrequent\nin sex offense cases. As the lead prosecutor, Villafafia vehemently opposed meeting with Epstein’s\natorneys and voiced her concerns to her supervisors, but was overruled by them. In Villafafia’s\nview, the significance of the early meetings granted to the defense team was that, but for those\nmeetings, the USAO would not have offered the disposition set forth in the July 3l, 2oo7 “term\nsheet” and, moreover, “that term sheet would never have been offered to anyone else.”\n\nOPR’s investigation established that while the defense atorneys persistently contacted the\nsubjects through emails, correspondence, and phone calls, relatively few in-person meetings\nactually occurred with the USAO <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span> involved in the mater. As shoun in the chart on the\nfollouing page, while the case was under federal investigation and before the NPA was signed,\nthe subject supervisors and defense counsel had five substantive meetings about the case—\n\nl55\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4479\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004502.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o5 of 349\nwith one of Epstein’s defense atorneys about it. Sloman told OPR during his interview that he\n“vaguely” remembered the computer issue. The documentary evidence confirms that he had at\nleast some contemporaneous knouledge of the issue—when asked by Villafafia whether to put off\na September l2, 2oo7 hearing on the litigation, he told her to do so. Finally, as noted previously,\nthe FBI co-case agent proposed at a meeting with USAO <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span> that the USAO wait until the\nlitigation was resolved before pursuing plea negotiations.\n\nContemporaneous records shou that Acosta was likely aware before the NPA was signed\nof the USAO’s efforts to obtain custody of Epstein’s computers and that after the NPA was signed,\nhe was informed about the use of legal process for obtaining the computer equipment. The NPA\nitself provides that “the federal . . . investigation will be suspended, and all pending [legal process]\nwill be held in abeyance,” that Epstein will withdraw his “motion to intervene and to quash certain\n[legal process],” and, further, that the parties would “maintain . . . evidence subject to [legal\nprocess] that have been issued, and including certain computer equipment, inviolate” until the\nNPA’s terms had been fully satisfied, at which point the legal process would be “deemed\nwithdrawn.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta’s numerous edits on the NPA’s final draft suggest that he\ngave it a close read, and OPR expects that Acosta would not have approved the agreement without\nunderstanding what legal process his office was agreeing to withdraw, or why the only type of\nevidence specified was “certain computer equipment.” In addition, Acosta told OPR that he\nworked closely with Sloman and Menchel, consulted with them, and relied on their counsel about\nthe case. Among other things, Acosta said he discussed with them concerns about the law and the\nevidentiary issues presented by a federal criminal trial. Therefore, although it is possible that\nSloman made the decision to postpone the hearing concerning the USAO’s efforts to obtain the\ncomputer equipment without consulting Acosta, once Acosta reviewed the draft NPA, Acosta was\non notice of the existence of and the ongoing litigation concerning Epstein’s missing computer\nequipment.\n\nVillafafia knew where the computers were; litigation over the demand for the equipment\nwas already underway; there was good reason to believe the computers contained relevant—and\npotentially critical—information; and it was clear Epstein did not want the contents of his\ncomputers disclosed. Nothing in the available record reveals that the USAO benefited from\nabandoning pursuit of this evidence when they did, or that there was any significant consideration\nof the costs and benefits of forgoing the litigation to obtain production of the computers.7”4\nInstead, the USAO agreed to postpone and ultimately to abandon its efforts to obtain evidence that\ncould have significantly changed Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation with a state\nguilty plea or led to additional significant federal charges. By agreeing to postpone the litigation,\nthe USAO gave away leverage that might have caused the defense to come to an agreement much\nearlier and on terms more favorable to the government. The USAO ultimately agreed to a term in\nthe NPA that permanently ended the government’s ability to obtain possible evidence of significant\ncrimes and did so with apparently litle serious consideration of the potential cost.\n\n254 If the USAO had significant concerns about its likelihood of prevailing, postponing the litigation to use it as\nleverage in the negotiations might have been strategically reasonable. Lourie suggested in his response to his interview\ntranscript that the court might have precluded production of the computers. Houever, OPR saw no evidence indicating\nthat Villafafia or her supervisors were concerned that the court would do so, and Villafafia had consulted with the\nDepartment’s subject mater experts before initiating her action to obtain the equipment.\nl78\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004509.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l2 of 349\nmanagers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.”*”\n\nSecond, key <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span> were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the... bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third\nad In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004518.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 22l of 349\ninformation about available services for victims. Therefore, even\nthough [the Department] may not afford CVRA rights to victims if\ncharges have not been filed in their cases, the [D]epartment may\nprovide certain services to victims that may serve the same function\nas some CVRA rights.””°\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines stated that the “prosecution stage” of the case began when “charges\nare filed and continue[d] through postsentencing legal proceedings.” The “U.S. Atorney in whose\ndistrict the prosecution is pending” was responsible for making “best efforts to see that crime\nvictims are notified” of their rights under the CVRA.\n\nDuring the prosecution stage, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the U.S. Atorney, or a\ndesignee, to notify crime victims of case events, such as the filing of charges; the release of an\noffender; the schedule of court proceedings; the acceptance of a guilty plea or nolo contendere or\nrendering of a verdict; and any sentence imposed. The 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to “provide the victim with reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding . . . that involves the crime against the victim.”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult\nwith victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea\nnegotiations, and pretrial diversion. In particular, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views\nabout, prospective plea negotiations. Nevertheless, the 2oo5 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a conviction. Depending on the agency having custody of the defendant, the U.S.\nAtorney or other agencies were responsible for victim notifications during this stage.\n\nIV. USAO AND FBI VICTIM/WITNESS NOTIFICATION PRACTICE AT THE TIME\n\nOF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. USAO Training\n\nAs U.S. Atorney, Acosta disseminated the May 2oo5 updated Guidelines to USAO\n<span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span> with a transmital memorandum dated February 27, 2oo6, stating that he expected each\nrecipient “to read and become familiar with the [2oo5] Guidelines.” Acosta noted in the\nmemorandum that the USAO had recently held an “all office training” addressing the 2oo5\nGuidelines and that new USAO atorneys who missed the training were required to view a\nvideotaped version of the training “immediately.” Acosta further noted that the USAO’s\n27o GAO CVRA Awareness Report at 66.\n\nl94\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004541.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 244 of 349\ninformed victims “of their right to collect damages prior to a thorough investigation of their\nallegations against Mr. Epstein”:\n\nNone of the victims were informed of the right to sue under\nSection 2255 prior to the investigation of the claims. Three victims\nwere notified shortly after the signing of the [NPA] of the general\nterms of that Agreement. You raised objections to any victim\nnotification, and no further notifications were done. Throughout\nthis process you have seen that I have prepared this case as though\nit would proceed to trial. Notifying the witnesses of the possibility\nof damages claims prior to concluding the mater by plea or trial\nwould only undermine my case. If my reassurances are insufficient\nthe fact that not a single victim has threatened to sue Mr. Epstein\nshould assure you of the integrity of the investigation.\n\nOn December l4, 2oo7, Villafafia forwarded to Acosta the draft victim notification leter\npreviously sent to the defense, along with two draft leters addressed to State Atorney Krischer;\nVillafafia’s transmital email to Acosta had the subject line, “The leters you requested.” One of\nthe draft leters to Krischer, to be signed by Villafafia, was to advise that the USAO had sent an\nenclosed victim notification leter to specified identified victims and referred to an enclosed “list\nof the identified victims and their contact information, in case you are required to provide them\nwith any further notification regarding their rights under Florida law.”*!? The second draft leter\nto Krischer, for Acosta’s signature, requested that Krischer respond to defense counsel’s\nallegations that the State Atorney’s Office was not comfortable with the proposed plea and\nsentence because it believed that the case should be resolved with probation and no sexual offender\nregistration. OPR found no evidence that these leters were sent to Krischer.*”°\n\nA few days later, in an apparent effort to move forward with victim notifications, Villafafia\nemailed Sloman, stating, “[Is there] anything that I or the agents should be doing?” Villafafia told\nSloman that “[the FBI case agent] is all worked up because another agent and [a named AUSA]\nare the subject of an OPR investigation for failing to properly confer with and notify victims [in\nan unrelated mater]. We seem to be in a Catch 22.”°?! OPR did not find a response to Villafafia’s\nemail.\n\nIn their December l4, 2oo7 meeting with Acosta and other USAO <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span> and in their\nlengthy follou-up leter to Acosta on December l7, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz continued to press\ntheir objections to the USAO’s involvement in the Epstein mater. They requested that Acosta\n3l9 The draft victim notification leter was identical to the draft victim notification leter sent to the defense on\nDecember 6, 2oo7, except that it contained a new plea date of January 4, 2oo8.\n\n32o Moreover, the leters were not included in the publicly released State Atorney’s file, which included other\ncorrespondence from the USAO. See Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office Public Records/Jeffrey Epstein, available\nat htp://sal5.org/stateatorney/NewsRoom/indexPR htm.\n\n32l OPR was unable to locate any records indicating that such allegations had ever been referred to OPR.\nVillafafia told OPR that “Catch 22” was a reference to instructions from supervisors “[t]hat we can’t go forward on”\nfiling federal charges and “I was told not to do victim notifications and confer at the time.”\n\n2l7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo454l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004542.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 245 of 349\nreview the appropriateness of the potential federal charges and the government’s “unprecedentedly\nexpansive interpretation” of l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn a December l9, 2oo7 response to the defense team, Acosta offered to revise two\nparagraphs in the NPA to resolve “disagreements” with the defense and to clarify that the parties\nintended Epstein’s § 2255 liability to “place these identified victims in the same position as they\nwould have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.” Acosta also advised\nthat although the USAO intended to notify the victims of the resolution of the federal investigation,\nthe USAO would leave to the State Atorney the decision whether to notify victims about the state\nproceedings:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court sentencing\nhearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim notification leter and\nthe statute. I would note that the United States provided the draft\nleter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition, First Assistant United\nStates Atorney Sloman already incorporated in the leter several\nedits that had been requested by defense counsel. I agree that [the\nCVRA] applies to notice of proceedings and results of investigations\nof federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We intend to provide\nvictims with notice of the federal resolution, as required by law. We\nwill defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding whether\nhe wishes to provide victims with notice of the state proceedings,\nalthough we will provide him with the information necessary to do\nso if he wishes.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this leter without running it by [Sloman], if\nnot other individuals in the office,” and records shou he sent a draft to Sloman and Villafafia.\nAcosta explained to OPR that he was not concerned about deferring to Krischer on the issue of\nwhether to notify the victims of the state proceedings because he did not view it as his role, or the\nrole of the USAO, “to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to the state\noutcome.”*” Acosta further explained to OPR that despite the USAO’s initial concerns about the\nState Atorney’s Office’s handling of the Epstein case, he did not believe it was appropriate to\nquestion that office’s ability to “fulfill whatever obligation they have,” and he added, “Let’s not\nassume .. . that the State Atorney’s Office is full of bad actors.” Acosta told OPR that it was his\nunderstanding “that the victims would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have\nan opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.” Acosta also told OPR that the state would\n322 Sloman’s handwriten notes from a December 2l, 2oo7 telephone conference indicate that Acosta asked the\ndefense, “Are there concerns re: 377l lang[uage],” to which Lefkouitz replied, “The state should have their oun\nmechanism.” At the time of the Epstein mater, under the Florida Constitution, upon request, victims were afforded\nthe “right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of, and to be present at” a defendant’s plea and sentencing. Fla.\nConst. art. I, § l6(b)(6). Similarly, pursuant to state statute, “Law enforcement <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span> shall ensure” that victims\nare given information about “[t]he stages in the criminal or juvenile justice process which are of significance to the\nvictim[.]” Fla. Stat. § 96o.ool(l)(a) (2oo7). Victims were also entitled to submit an oral or writen impact statement.\nFla. Stat. § 96o.ool(l)ck) (2oo7). Moreover, “in a case in which the victim is a minor child,” the guardian or family\nof the victim must be consulted by the state atorney “in order to obtain the views of the victim or family about the\ndisposition of any criminal or juvenile case” including plea agreements.

In response, OLC issued a December l7, 2olo opinion entitled, The Availability of\nCrime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4. Based on the CVRA’s\nlanguage, relevant case law, and memoranda opinions from Department components, OLC\nreaffirmed its 2oo5 conclusion that CVRA rights do not vest until a criminal charge has been filed\n(by complaint, information, or indictment) and the rights cease to be available if “all charges are\ndismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or if the [g]overnment declines to bring formal\ncharges after the filing of a complaint).”°”\n\nAfter OLC issued its opinion, the Department revised the 2oo5 Guidelines in October 2oll\nbut did not change its fundamental position that the CVRA rights did not vest until after criminal\ncharges were filed. The 2oll revision did, houever, add language concerning victim consultation\nbefore a defendant is charged: “In circumstances where plea negotiations occur before a case has\nbeen brought, Department policy is that this should include reasonable consultation prior to the\nfiling of a charging instrument with the court.”*”? The use of the word “should” in the 2oll\nGuidelines indicates that “<span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span> are expected to take the action . . . unless there is an\nappropriate, articulable reason not to do so.”*8° Nevertheless, the required consultation “may be\ngeneral in nature” and “does not have to be specific to a particular plea offer.”°*! The revisions\nalso specified that AUSAs were to ensure that victims had a right to be reasonably heard at plea\nproceedings.**\n\nOn November 2, 2oll, U.S. Senator Jon Kyl, a co-sponsor of the CVRA, sent a leter to\nAtorney General Eric Holder, arguing that the 2oll Guidelines revisions “conflict[ed] quite\nclearly with the CVRA’s plain language” because the 2oll Guidelines did “not extend any rights\nto victims until charges have been filed.” The Department’s response emphasized that the\n378 OLC “express[ed] no opinion” as to whether it is a mater of “good practice” to inform victims of their CVRA\nrights prior to the filing of a complaint or after the dismissal of charges.\nae See 2oll Guidelines, Art.

Federal prosecutors should be\navailable to consult with victims about major case decisions, such as dismissals,\nrelease of the accused pending judicial proceedings (when such release is for\nnoninvestigative purposes), plea negotiations, and pretrial diversion. Because\nvictims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government, and may disclose\nwhatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only\nnonsensitive data and public information. Consultations should comply with the\nprosecutor’s obligations under applicable rules of professional conduct.\nRepresentatives of the Department should take care to inform victims that neither\nthe Department’s advocacy for victims nor any other effort that the Department\nmay make on their behalf constitutes or creates an atorney-client relationship\nbetween such victims and the lawyers for the Government.\nDepartment <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span> should not provide legal advice to victims.\n(2) Prosecutor Availability. Prosecutors should be reasonably available to consult\nwith victims regarding significant adversities they may suffer as a result of delays\nin the prosecution of the case and should, at the appropriate time, inform the court\nof the reasonable concerns that have been conveyed to the prosecutor.\n(3) Proposed Plea Agreements. Responsible officials should make reasonable\nefforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about,\nprospective plea negotiations. In determining what is reasonable, the responsible\nofficial should consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving\nnotice and considering views in the context of the particular case, including, but not\nlimited to, the follouing factors:\n\n(a) The impact on public safety and risks to personal safety.\n\n(b) The number of victims.\n\n(c) Whether time is of the essence in negotiating or entering a proposed plea.\n\n252\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4576\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004594.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 297 of 349\nthe PBPD during its investigation into Epstein’s conduct. Absent information from the USAO,\nthe state would not have been in a position to notify those additional victims of the state plea\nproceeding, even if the State Atorney had decided to include other victims identified during the\nstate investigation. Furthermore, at the time he made his decision, Acosta had already been advised\nby Villafafia that Belohlavek, in November 2oo7, had requested that the USAO notify victims,\npresumably those identified during the federal investigation, about the state plea hearing.\n\nAcosta told OPR that it had been his understanding at the time of Epstein’s plea that the\nvictims would be made aware of the proceeding and would have an opportunity to speak. Acosta\nalso told OPR that he expected the state would have “notified [the victims] that that was an all-\nencompassing plea, that the state court sentence would also mean that the federal government was\nnot proceeding.” There is no evidence, houever, that he verified this understanding with Sloman\nor Villafafia, let alone the State Atorney. OPR found no indication that Acosta ever\ncommunicated, or directed Sloman or Villafafia to communicate, his decision to the State Atorney\nor to provide the State Atorney’s Office with a complete list of victims identified during the\nfederal investigation. OPR located a draft leter to the State Atorney’s Office that Villafafia\nprepared and forwarded to Acosta in December 2oo7, which did provide such information, but\nOPR found no evidence that the leter was ever sent, and it was not among materials publicly\nreleased from the State Atorney’s Office.*** OPR also found evidence that both Sloman and\nVillafafia interacted with the State Atorney’s Office in the months leading up to the June 3o, 2oo8\nplea hearing, but there is no indication that they discussed victim notification issues with that\noffice, and Villafafia’s last minute request to PBPD Chief Reiter to notify victims indicates that\nthe USAO had not coordinated with the State Atorney’s Office. Belohlavek told OPR that no one\nfrom the USAO provided her with a list of victims or coordinated any notification of victims to\nappear at the hearing.\n\nKrischer and Belohlavek were thus evidently unaware that Acosta had decided to leave it\nto them to decide whether to notify victims about the state proceeding. In the absence of some\ndiscussion of which or hou many victims the state intended to notify, what the state intended to\ntell them about Epstein’s plea, and whether the state intended to let the victims speak at the plea\nhearing, Acosta had no way to ensure that his assumption about victim notification was accurate.\nIn other words, Acosta failed to plan for hou all of the identified victims of Epstein’s crimes, both\nfederal and state, “would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have an\nopportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\n\nOPR did not find evidence that Acosta acted for the purpose of excluding victims from the\nplea hearing, and Acosta’s assumption that the state would handle victim notification appropriately\nwas not unsupported. State prosecutors are subject to victim notification requirements under the\nFlorida Constitution, and the state prosecution offices have victim witness <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span>, resources,\nand processes to help accomplish notification. Houever, Acosta was aware—through the\nprosecution memoranda, the draft indictment, and email communications from Villafafia—that the\nUSAO’s investigation had expanded beyond those victims identified in the original PBPD\n424 The text of the leter indicated that Epstein’s atorneys asked the USAO not to inform victims of “any rights\nthey may have as victims of the charges filed by the State Atorney’s Office” and that the USAO was providing the\nState Atorney’s Office with a list of the 33 identified federal victims “in case you are required to provide them with\nany further notification regarding their rights under Florida law.”\n\n27o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4594\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004606.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o9 of 349\nto be paid to the FBI’s communications to ensure that the victims were receiving accurate and\ntimely information that was consistent with the status of the case and with the USAO’s\ncommunications with victims.*4”\n\nThe decision not to inform victims and their atorneys about the existence of the NPA gave\nvictims and the public the misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel\nto keep the agreement secret from the victims. Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span> have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“48 For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities. In certain cases, such as the\nEpstein case, prosecutors may need to provide more oversight when multiple Department\ncomponents are communicating with victims to avoid providing confusing and contradictory\nmessages.\nindependent of the NPA provision. OPR also notes that impeachment regarding the NPA provision may have\npermited the government to rehabilitate the victims through their prior statements to law enforcement. In other words,\nwhile the USAO’s view concerning potential impeachment was not unreasonable, more extensive consideration of the\ncase agent’s concerns might have led the prosecutors to conclude that the risk of the information being used to\nsignificantly damage the credibility of the victims was lou.\n\nHe In addition to the FBI leters previously discussed, another example of the inconsistent communication can\nbe seen in leters that were to be sent after Epstein entered his guilty plea to two victims residing in foreign countries.\nAlthough OPR was unable to confirm that the two victims actually received the leters, t appears from the records\nOPR reviewed that the government intended to provide them with a standard FBI leter stating that the case was under\ninvestigation while also providing them with a USAO leter stating that the case had been resolved through Epstein’s\nstate guilty plea.\n\n448 OPR understands that the Department is in the process of revising the 2oll Guidelines.\n\n282\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004607.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3lo of 349\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span>; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation. OPR conducted extensive interviews of\nall five subjects. The subjects also submited comments on OPR’s draft report.\n\n283\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004613.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3l6 of 349\n6.

Subjects\nOPR requested that all five subjects provide writen responses detailing their involvement\nin the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions\nrelating to victim notification and consultation. In addition, OPR conducted extensive interviews\nof each subject under oath and before a court reporter. Each subject was represented by counsel\nand had access to relevant contemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview. The\nsubjects reviewed and provided comments on their interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report.\n2. Witnesses\nOPR conducted more than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their\nsupervisors, and FBI administrative <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span>. OPR interviewed current and former USAO staff\nand atorneys and current and former Department atorneys and senior managers, including former\nDeputy Atorney General Mark Filip and former Assistant Atorney General for the Criminal\nDivision Alice Fisher.

Sergeant Schaeffer and other law enforcement officials interviewed Cosby in\nNew York City, utilizing a writen question and answer format. Cosby was accompanied\nby his atorneys, Walter M.

Recently she has manifested symptoms of depression and trauma such as\nanxiety, and minor cognitive deficits. These continue to be exacerbated by ongoing\nsleep deprivation and the conditions of her confinement. Given my extensive\nexperience working with incarcerated individuals, based on the manner in which\nMs. Maxwell’s symptoms have manifest, it is clear that her symptoms are in no\nway related to the charges that have been brought against her.

The fact that she was subjected to\nan anti-suicide surveillance regime even though she has no suicidal tendencies demonstrates that\nshe was being treated differently, without any objective justification. Follouing the verdict, and\nin the presence of two officers, an MDC psychologist told Ms. Maxwell she was being placed on\nsuicide watch.

Beyond duration of confinement (the quantitative\nmeasure of imprisonment), she was subjected to disparate treatment (e.g., long-term isolation and\nunusual restrictions and deprivation) amounting to a profound qualitative difference.\nPre-Sentence Detention Should Not Be Pre-Sentence Punishment\n\nConvicted offenders are sent to prison as punishment, not for punishment. Despite\ncomplaints made by Ms. Maxwell and her counsel, the MDC and BOP officials retained unchecked\nauthority to incarcerate her as they pleased on conditions that constituted unusual punishment for\na non-violent pretrial detainee who posed no threat to herself or others.

(Dkt. No. 76). Over the past week, the Government has\nspoken with MDC legal counsel regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement and has tried\nto gather additional information regarding the concerns raised by the defendant, which the\nGovernment has shared with defense counsel. The Government has also conferred with defense\ncounsel three times regarding the same, as well as the defense’s request relating to MDC Warden\nHeriberto Tellez. The parties have been unable to reach agreement. Our respective positions\nfollou.\n\nThe Government respectfully submits that the Court should allou MDC legal counsel to\nrespond directly in writing to the Court and defense counsel regarding the concerns defense\ncounsel has raised relating to the defendant’s conditions of confinement. The Government\nunderstands that MDC legal counsel is prepared to submit a leter by this Friday, December 4,\n2o2o. Such a leter is the appropriate next step at this time, as it will allou the Court to hear\ndirectly from MDC legal counsel who can address the defendant’s conditions of confinement. The\nleter will allou the Court to ascertain whether further inquiry, including a personal appearance by\nthe Warden or other MDC <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span>, is necessary. Moreover, the Government does not\nunderstand the concerns raised by the defense to implicate the defendant’s access to legal materials\nor her ability to communicate with her counsel. As noted in the Government’s leter dated\nNovember 23, 2o2o, the defendant continues to have more time to review her discovery than any\nother inmate at the MDC. The defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC\ninmate to communicate with her atorneys. (Dkt. No. 74).\n\nThe defense disagrees. As communicated to the Government, the defense’s position is as\nfollous: Warden Heriberto Tellez should appear before the Court to directly address concerns\nregarding Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement, which specifically target her. On October\n29, 2o2o, the defense emailed a leter to Warden Tellez detailing the onerous and restrictive\nconditions, including but not limited to concerns regarding the supplemental camera; excessive\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2o262\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021182.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, SAB 3536o38, Pagelo of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8 of 348\nan investigation into the mater and would review the USAO’s decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through the NPA.°®\n\nAfter the district court issued its ruling in the CVRA litigation, on February 2l, 2ol9, OPR\nincluded within the scope of its investigation an examination of the government’s conduct that\nformed the basis for the court’s findings that the USAO violated the CVRA in failing to afford\nvictims a reasonable right to confer with the government about the NPA before the agreement was\nsigned and that the government affirmatively misled victims about the status of the federal\ninvestigation.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department components, including the Office of\nthe Deputy Atorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys.\nThe records included emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials.

The Department enforces\nfederal criminal law through investigations and prosecutions of violations of federal criminal\nstatutes. It also engages in civil litigation. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nDepartment had approximately llo,ooo employees in 4o components. The Department’s\nheadquarters are in Washington, D.C., and it conducts most of its work through field locations\naround the nation and overseas.\n\nThe prosecution of federal criminal laws is handled primarily through 94 U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices, each headed by a presidentially appointed (with advice and consent of the U.S. Senate)\nU.S. Atorney who has independent authority over his or her office but is overseen by the Atorney\nGeneral through the Deputy Atorney General.! The Department’s Criminal Division, headed by\nan Assistant Atorney General, includes components with specialized areas of expertise that also\nprosecute cases, assist in the prosecutions handled by U.S. Atorney’s Offices, and provide legal\nexpertise and policy guidance. Among the Criminal Division components mentioned in this\nReport are the Appellate Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the Computer Crime and\nIntellectual Property Section, and, most prominently, the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section\n(CEOS).\n\nCEOS, based in Washington, D.C., comprises atorneys and investigators who specialize\nin investigating and prosecuting child exploitation crimes, especially those involving technology,\nand they assist U.S. Atorney’s Offices in investigations, trials, and appeals related to these\noffenses. CEOS provides advice and training to federal prosecutors, law enforcement <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span>,\nand government officials. CEOS also works to develop and refine proposals for prosecution\npolicies, legislation, government practices, and agency regulations.\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) (revised in 2ol8 and renamed the Justice Manual)\nis a compilation of Department rules, policies, and guidance governing the conduct of Department\nemployees.

In this Report, OPR applies the USAM provisions in effect at the relevant time.\n\nDuring the period most relevant to this Report, the Atorney General was Michael\nMukasey, the Deputy Atorney General was Mark Filip, and the Assistant Atorney General for\nthe Criminal Division was Alice Fisher. The Chief of CEOS was Andrew Oosterban.\n\nThe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (USAO) handles federal\nmaters in the Southern District of Florida judicial district, which covers the counties of Miami-\nDade, Brouard, Monroe, Palm Beach, Martin, St. Lucie, Indian River, Okeechobee, and\nHighlands, an area of over l5,ooo square miles.

The main office is in Miami; staffed branch offices are located in Fort Lauderdale,\nWest Palm Beach (covering Palm Beach County), and Fort Pierce; and an unstaffed branch office\nis located in Key West. The West Palm Beach USAO office is approximately 7o miles from the\nMiami office. The USAO is headed by the U.S. Atorney; the second-in-command is the First\nAssistant U.S. Atorney (FAUSA), who serves as principal advisor to the U.S. Atorney and\nsupervises all components of the USAO, including the Criminal, Civil, and Appellate Divisions,\neach of which is headed by a Chief.

As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s compliance with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct. After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking enforcement of their rights\nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l (‘the CVRA litigation” or “the\nCVRA case”), in July 2oo8, Villafafia served as co-counsel to the lead atorney representing the\nUSAO until February 2ol9, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.* Villafafia\nleft the USAO in August 2ol9 to join another federal government agency.\n\nThe follouing chart shous the USAO positions filled by the subjects, or other USAO\n<span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span>, during the period of the Epstein investigation.\n\n2 Project Safe Childhood is a nationwide initiative launched by the Department in May 2oo6 to combat the\ngrouing epidemic of technology-facilitated child sexual exploitation and abuse.

One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span>.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.** Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request.

At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to . . . change anything.”\n\na4 Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nUS. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2l222\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021303.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l39 | 3536o38, Pagel3l of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l29 of 348\nthese victim issues as insurmountable but, based on these alone, the CEOS Trial Atorney\nconsidered a potential prosecution of Epstein to be a “crap shoot.” In addition, she told OPR that\nthere were novel legal issues in the case that also presented difficulties, although she believed these\ndifficulties could be overcome. Shortly after the CEOS Trial Atorney met with the victims,\nhouever, “things just stopped” when Oosterban instructed her to cease her involvement in the\ncase and CEOS engaged in the Criminal Division review sought by Epstein’s defense team.\nIX. FEBRUARY - JUNE 2oo8: THE DEPARTMENT’S REVIEW\n\nEpstein’s defense atorneys sought a broad review from the Department, one that would\nencompass the defense complaints about federal jurisdiction, specific terms in the NPA, and the\nvarious allegations of professional misconduct by USAO atorneys and other <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span>. The\nDepartment, houever, only reviewed the issue of federal jurisdiction and never reviewed the NPA\nor any specific provisions.!©? Nonetheless, the process took several months as the defense\nappealed first to CEOS and the Department’s Criminal Division, and then to the Office of the\nDeputy Atorney General. The chart set forth on the follouing page shous the positions and\nrelationships among the individuals in those offices involved in communicating with the USAO\nor defense beginning in November 2oo7 or in those offices’ reviews, which continued through\nJune 2oo8.\nto On February 28, 2oo8, USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior sent to the Civil Rights Division writen\nnotification of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a child exploitation mater” involving Epstein and others “that\nmay result in charges of violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l.” USAM § 8-3.l2o required a U.S. Atorney to notify the\nCivil Rights Division, in writing, “[a]t the outset of a criminal investigation . . . that may implicate federal criminal\ncivil rights statutes, .. . and in no event later than ten days before the commencement of the examination of witnesses\nbefore a grand jury.” The provision also required notification to CEOS in cases involving sex trafficking of minors.\nThe writen notification was to identify the targets of the investigation, the factual allegations to be investigated, the\nstatutes which may have been violated, the U.S. Atorney’s assessment of the significance of the case, whether the\ncase was of “national interest,” and the U.S. Atorney’s proposed staffing of the mater.\n\nVillatfafia became aware of this requirement in late February 2oo8, and she prepared a writen notification\nthat was edited by Sloman, who discussed it with Acosta. After briefly summarizing the facts, Senior advised:\n\nThe Office anticipates charges of violations of Title l8, United States Code,\nSections 37l, 2422, 2423, and l59l. The investigation of the case by the City of\nPalm Beach Police Department has resulted in press coverage because of the\ntitillating nature of the facts, but we see this case as similar to other “child\nprostitution” cases charged by our office, and not a mater of “national interest”\nas defined by the U.S. Atorney’s Manual.\n\nIn the notification, Senior stated that CEOS “has been involved and is currently reviewing the mater,” he\nanticipated the case would be staffed by USAO and Department <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span>, and “[i]f we determine that the case should\nbe [charged], a copy [of the charging document] will be forwarded to you.” OPR did not locate a response from the\nCivil Rights Division to the notification.\n\nlo3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021341.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON I67 3536o38, Pagel69 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l67 of 348\nto prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.7°°\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span>. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA, OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l34l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021350.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel78 of 258\nSA-l76\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l76 of 348\nreconsider the provision. Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely\nif his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s atorneys.\n\nSecond, Epstein himself was not satisfied with the NPA. Immediately after signing the\nagreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the\ninvestigation inappropriate. In addition to repeatedly atacking the NPA in his submissions to the\nDepartment, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of\nmisconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span>. Epstein’s dissatisfaction\nwith the NPA, and his personal atacks on individual prosecutors involved in negotiating the\nagreement, appear inconsistent with a conclusion that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s\nbenefit.\n\nD. OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense\n\nCounsel, Decisions to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors\nEstablished That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided\nImproper Benefits to Epstein\n\nIn evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media\naccounts to shou that the subjects provided improper benefits to Epstein or which purportedly\nsuggested that the subjects acted from improper influences. OPR examined these factors but did\nnot find that they supported a finding that the subjects were influenced by favoritism, bias, or other\nimproper motivation.\n\nl. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any\nImproper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships\nwith His Atorneys\n\nEpstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple atorneys who had preexisting personal\nconnections to some of the government atorneys involved in his case, in the State Atorney’s\nOffice, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department. Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first atorneys who\ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Atorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was\nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former\nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized. Later, when Epstein\nwas seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz, prominent atorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from\nhis previous employment with that firm.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she believed Acosta “was influenced by the stature of Epstein’s\natorneys.” Critically, houever, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in\nthe follouing subsection, neither Villafafia nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed\nidentified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an\nimproper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal relationship with defense counsel (or\nfor any other improper reason). Villafafia explained hou, in her view, the “legal prouess” of\nEpstein’s atorneys had an impact on the case:\n\nl5o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l35o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021355.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ABT 3536o38, Pagel83 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8l of 348\naccept the two-year proposal when it was made, but instead continued to press for a sentence of\nhome confinement, suggesting that the defense had not requested the two-year term as a favor and\ndid not view it as such. The defense had previously rejected the state’s offer of a sentence of\nprobation, and there is no indication in the contemporaneous records that Epstein viewed any jail\nsentence favorably and certainly that did not appear to be the view of the defense team in the early\nstages of the negotiations.\n\nAs discussed belou, after extensive questioning of the subjects about the basis for the two-\nyear offer, and a thorough review of the documentary record, OPR was unable to determine the\nreasoning underlying the decision to offer two years as the term of incarceration, as opposed to\nany other term of years. Nonetheless, OPR concludes from the evidence that Acosta was aware of\nand approved the initial offer to the defense, which included the two-year term of incarceration.\nThe only evidence suggesting that the offer of two years stemmed from an improper motivation of\nMenchel’s was a single second-hand statement in an email drafted many years later. Sloman, the\npurported declarant, told OPR that he could not recall whether he made the statement, but he firmly\ndisputed that the email accurately reflected either the reason for the two-year proposal or his\nunderstanding of that reason. Villafafia herself could remember litle about the critical\nconversation with Sloman, including whether she had recorded accurately what Sloman had said.\nGiven the lack of any corroborating evidence, and the evidence shouing Epstein’s vigorous\nresistance to the proposal, OPR concludes that there is no evidence to support the statement in\nVillafafia’s 2ol8 email that Menchel had extended a two-year plea deal as a favor to one of\nEpstein’s atorneys.\n\nE, The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects’ Meetings with Defense\n\nCounsel Were Improper Benefits to Epstein\n\nOPR considered whether decisions by Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie to meet with\ndefense counsel while possible charges were under consideration or during the period after the\nNPA was signed and before Epstein entered his state guilty pleas evidenced improper favoritism\ntouard or the provision of an improper benefit to the Epstein defense team.\n\nl, The Evidence Shous That the Subjects’ Decisions to Meet with\nEpstein’s Legal Team Were Warranted by Strategic Considerations\n\nAlthough pre-indictment negotiations are typical in white-collar criminal cases involving\nfinancial crimes, witnesses told OPR that pre-charge meetings with defense counsel are infrequent\nin sex offense cases. As the lead prosecutor, Villafafia vehemently opposed meeting with Epstein’s\natorneys and voiced her concerns to her supervisors, but was overruled by them. In Villafafia’s\nview, the significance of the early meetings granted to the defense team was that, but for those\nmeetings, the USAO would not have offered the disposition set forth in the July 3l, 2oo7 “term\nsheet” and, moreover, “that term sheet would never have been offered to anyone else.”\n\nOPR’s investigation established that while the defense atorneys persistently contacted the\nsubjects through emails, correspondence, and phone calls, relatively few in-person meetings\nactually occurred with the USAO <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span> involved in the mater. As shoun in the chart on the\nfollouing page, while the case was under federal investigation and before the NPA was signed,\nthe subject supervisors and defense counsel had five substantive meetings about the case—\n\nl55\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l355\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021378.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3o4 3536o38, Page2o6 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o4 of 348\nwith one of Epstein’s defense atorneys about it. Sloman told OPR during his interview that he\n“vaguely” remembered the computer issue. The documentary evidence confirms that he had at\nleast some contemporaneous knouledge of the issue—when asked by Villafafia whether to put off\na September l2, 2oo7 hearing on the litigation, he told her to do so. Finally, as noted previously,\nthe FBI co-case agent proposed at a meeting with USAO <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span> that the USAO wait until the\nlitigation was resolved before pursuing plea negotiations.\n\nContemporaneous records shou that Acosta was likely aware before the NPA was signed\nof the USAO’s efforts to obtain custody of Epstein’s computers and that after the NPA was signed,\nhe was informed about the use of legal process for obtaining the computer equipment. The NPA\nitself provides that “the federal . . . investigation will be suspended, and all pending [legal process]\nwill be held in abeyance,” that Epstein will withdraw his “motion to intervene and to quash certain\n[legal process],” and, further, that the parties would “maintain . . . evidence subject to [legal\nprocess] that have been issued, and including certain computer equipment, inviolate” until the\nNPA’s terms had been fully satisfied, at which point the legal process would be “deemed\nwithdrawn.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta’s numerous edits on the NPA’s final draft suggest that he\ngave it aclose read, and OPR expects that Acosta would not have approved the agreement without\nunderstanding what legal process his office was agreeing to withdraw, or why the only type of\nevidence specified was “certain computer equipment.” In addition, Acosta told OPR that he\nworked closely with Sloman and Menchel, consulted with them, and relied on their counsel about\nthe case. Among other things, Acosta said he discussed with them concerns about the law and the\nevidentiary issues presented by a federal criminal trial. Therefore, although it is possible that\nSloman made the decision to postpone the hearing concerning the USAO’s efforts to obtain the\ncomputer equipment without consulting Acosta, once Acosta reviewed the draft NPA, Acosta was\non notice of the existence of and the ongoing litigation concerning Epstein’s missing computer\nequipment.\n\nVillafafia knew where the computers were; litigation over the demand for the equipment\nwas already underway; there was good reason to believe the computers contained relevant—and\npotentially critical—information; and it was clear Epstein did not want the contents of his\ncomputers disclosed. Nothing in the available record reveals that the USAO benefited from\nabandoning pursuit of this evidence when they did, or that there was any significant consideration\nof the costs and benefits of forgoing the litigation to obtain production of the computers.?™\nInstead, the USAO agreed to postpone and ultimately to abandon its efforts to obtain evidence that\ncould have significantly changed Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation with a state\nguilty plea or led to additional significant federal charges. By agreeing to postpone the litigation,\nthe USAO gave away leverage that might have caused the defense to come to an agreement much\nearlier and on terms more favorable to the government. The USAO ultimately agreed to a term in\nthe NPA that permanently ended the government’s ability to obtain possible evidence of significant\ncrimes and did so with apparently litle serious consideration of the potential cost.\n\n254 If the USAO had significant concerns about its likelihood of prevailing, postponing the litigation to use it as\nleverage in the negotiations might have been strategically reasonable. Lourie suggested in his response to his interview\ntranscript that the court might have precluded production of the computers. Houever, OPR saw no evidence indicating\nthat Villafafia or her supervisors were concerned that the court would do so, and Villafafia had consulted with the\nDepartment’s subject mater experts before initiating her action to obtain the equipment.\nl78\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l378\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021385.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TT 3536o38, Page2l3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ll of 348\nmanagers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.°’\n\nSecond, key <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span> were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the .. . bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third\n2oH In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l385\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021394.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 35o 3536o38, Page222 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22o of 348\ninformation about available services for victims. Therefore, even\nthough [the Department] may not afford CVRA rights to victims if\ncharges have not been filed in their cases, the [D]epartment may\nprovide certain services to victims that may serve the same function\n\nas some CVRA rights.””°\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines stated that the “prosecution stage” of the case began when “charges\nare filed and continue[d] through postsentencing legal proceedings.” The “U.S. Atorney in whose\ndistrict the prosecution is pending” was responsible for making “best efforts to see that crime\nvictims are notified” of their rights under the CVRA.\n\nDuring the prosecution stage, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the U.S. Atorney, or a\ndesignee, to notify crime victims of case events, such as the filing of charges; the release of an\noffender; the schedule of court proceedings; the acceptance of a guilty plea or nolo contendere or\nrendering of a verdict; and any sentence imposed. The 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to “provide the victim with reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding .. . that involves the crime against the victim.”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult\nwith victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea\nnegotiations, and pretrial diversion. In particular, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views\nabout, prospective plea negotiations. Nevertheless, the 2oo5 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a conviction. Depending on the agency having custody of the defendant, the U.S.\nAtorney or other agencies were responsible for victim notifications during this stage.\n\nIV.

OPR found no evidence that these leters were sent to Krischer.?”°\n\nA few days later, in an apparent effort to move forward with victim notifications, Villafafia\nemailed Sloman, stating, “[Is there] anything that I or the agents should be doing?” Villafafia told\nSloman that “[the FBI case agent] is all worked up because another agent and [a named AUSA]\nare the subject of an OPR investigation for failing to properly confer with and notify victims [in\nan unrelated mater].

Acosta further explained to OPR that despite the USAO’s initial concerns about the\nState Atorney’s Office’s handling of the Epstein case, he did not believe it was appropriate to\nquestion that office’s ability to “fulfill whatever obligation they have,” and he added, “Let’s not\nassume... that the State Atorney’s Office is full of bad actors.” Acosta told OPR that it was his\nunderstanding “that the victims would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have\nan opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.” Acosta also told OPR that the state would\nB28 Sloman’s handwriten notes from a December 2l, 2oo7 telephone conference indicate that Acosta asked the\ndefense, “Are there concerns re: 377l lang[uage],” to which Lefkouitz replied, “The state should have their oun\nmechanism.” At the time of the Epstein mater, under the Florida Constitution, upon request, victims were afforded\nthe “right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of, and to be present at” a defendant’s plea and sentencing.

The 2oll revision did, houever, add language concerning victim consultation\nbefore a defendant is charged: “In circumstances where plea negotiations occur before a case has\nbeen brought, Department policy is that this should include reasonable consultation prior to the\nfiling of a charging instrument with the court.”?”?

Federal prosecutors should be\navailable to consult with victims about major case decisions, such as dismissals,\nrelease of the accused pending judicial proceedings (when such release is for\nnoninvestigative purposes), plea negotiations, and pretrial diversion.

Absent information from the USAO,\nthe state would not have been in a position to notify those additional victims of the state plea\nproceeding, even if the State Atorney had decided to include other victims identified during the\nstate investigation. Furthermore, at the time he made his decision, Acosta had already been advised\nby Villafafia that Belohlavek, in November 2oo7, had requested that the USAO notify victims,\npresumably those identified during the federal investigation, about the state plea hearing.\n\nAcosta told OPR that it had been his understanding at the time of Epstein’s plea that the\nvictims would be made aware of the proceeding and would have an opportunity to speak. Acosta\nalso told OPR that he expected the state would have “notified [the victims] that that was an all-\nencompassing plea, that the state court sentence would also mean that the federal government was\nnot proceeding.” There is no evidence, houever, that he verified this understanding with Sloman\nor Villafafia, let alone the State Atorney. OPR found no indication that Acosta ever\ncommunicated, or directed Sloman or Villafafia to communicate, his decision to the State Atorney\nor to provide the State Atorney’s Office with a complete list of victims identified during the\nfederal investigation. OPR located a draft leter to the State Atorney’s Office that Villafafia\nprepared and forwarded to Acosta in December 2oo7, which did provide such information, but\nOPR found no evidence that the leter was ever sent, and it was not among materials publicly\nreleased from the State Atorney’s Office.47* OPR also found evidence that both Sloman and\nVillafafia interacted with the State Atorney’s Office in the months leading up to the June 3o, 2oo8\nplea hearing, but there is no indication that they discussed victim notification issues with that\noffice, and Villafafia’s last minute request to PBPD Chief Reiter to notify victims indicates that\nthe USAO had not coordinated with the State Atorney’s Office. Belohlavek told OPR that no one\nfrom the USAO provided her with a list of victims or coordinated any notification of victims to\nappear at the hearing.\n\nKrischer and Belohlavek were thus evidently unaware that Acosta had decided to leave it\nto them to decide whether to notify victims about the state proceeding. In the absence of some\ndiscussion of which or hou many victims the state intended to notify, what the state intended to\ntell them about Epstein’s plea, and whether the state intended to let the victims speak at the plea\nhearing, Acosta had no way to ensure that his assumption about victim notification was accurate.\nIn other words, Acosta failed to plan for hou all of the identified victims of Epstein’s crimes, both\nfederal and state, “would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have an\nopportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\n\nOPR did not find evidence that Acosta acted for the purpose of excluding victims from the\nplea hearing, and Acosta’s assumption that the state would handle victim notification appropriately\nwas not unsupported. State prosecutors are subject to victim notification requirements under the\nFlorida Constitution, and the state prosecution offices have victim witness <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span>, resources,\nand processes to help accomplish notification. Houever, Acosta was aware—through the\nprosecution memoranda, the draft indictment, and email communications from Villafafia—that the\nUSAO’s investigation had expanded beyond those victims identified in the original PBPD\n424 The text of the leter indicated that Epstein’s atorneys asked the USAO not to inform victims of “any rights\nthey may have as victims of the charges filed by the State Atorney’s Office” and that the USAO was providing the\nState Atorney’s Office with a list of the 33 identified federal victims “in case you are required to provide them with\nany further notification regarding their rights under Florida law.”\n\n27o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l472\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021484.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o8 3536o39, Paged4 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o8 of 348\nto be paid to the FBI’s communications to ensure that the victims were receiving accurate and\ntimely information that was consistent with the status of the case and with the USAO’s\ncommunications with victims.*47\n\nThe decision not to inform victims and their atorneys about the existence of the NPA gave\nvictims and the public the misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel\nto keep the agreement secret from the victims. Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span> have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“® For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities. In certain cases, such as the\nEpstein case, prosecutors may need to provide more oversight when multiple Department\ncomponents are communicating with victims to avoid providing confusing and contradictory\nmessages.\nindependent of the NPA provision. OPR also notes that impeachment regarding the NPA provision may have\npermited the government to rehabilitate the victims through their prior statements to law enforcement. In other words,\nwhile the USAO’s view concerning potential impeachment was not unreasonable, more extensive consideration of the\ncase agent’s concerns might have led the prosecutors to conclude that the risk of the information being used to\nsignificantly damage the credibility of the victims was lou.\n\n447 In addition to the FBI leters previously discussed, another example of the inconsistent communication can\nbe seen in leters that were to be sent after Epstein entered his guilty plea to two victims residing in foreign countries.\nAlthough OPR was unable to confirm that the two victims actually received the leters, it appears from the records\nOPR reviewed that the government intended to provide them with a standard FBI leter stating that the case was under\ninvestigation while also providing them with a USAO leter stating that the case had been resolved through Epstein’s\nstate guilty plea.\n\n448 OPR understands that the Department is in the process of revising the 2oll Guidelines.\n\n282\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l484\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021485.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ER 3o9 3536o39, Paged5 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o9 of 348\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span>; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR.

The Defendant cites in support the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, but that case is unavailing to her position. There, the\nSupreme Court held that “where a juror makes a clear statement that indicates he or she relied on\nracial stereotypes or animus to convict a criminal defendant, the Sixth Amendment requires that\nthe no-impeachment rule give way in order to permit the trial court to consider the evidence of\nthe juror’s statement and any resulting denial of the jury trial guarantee.” l37 S.

In fact, it expressly contrasted the case of a juror\nwith racial animus to a juror that “ha[s] a personal experience that improperly influences her\nconsideration of the case,” as was at issue in Warger v.

As the bureau, which oversees\nl22 federal prisons and more than l7o,ooo inmates nationwide, is working to implement the First Step Act's prison reforms and deal with the circumstances\nthat led to Epstein's death, it is facing severe resource issues, according to Hawk Sawyer.\n“\\We have put such huge strains on the Burean of Prisons trying to accomplish its mission,\" Hawk Sawyer said before the Senate Judiciary Commitee, “With\nthe dramatic grouth we've had, the budget cuts, staffing shortages, it’s just been incredible to me that the bureau has been able to function during the last l6\nyears that I've been gone.” The vast majority of staff are good, hardworking employees, “but they are tired because they are stretched,\" she added.\nHawk Sawyer atributed the resouree problem to the rapid increase in the prison population in the last 3o years, employees retiring at a faster rate than they\n. are hired, uncertain budgets, ihe recent government shutdoun andthe hiring [freeze early in the Trump administration. \"We have never had adequate\n__ Pesources to provide all the programs for all the inmates,” Hawk Sawyer said. “I'm hoping that will change nou since you all support the First Step Act.”\nAccording to the hurean's website it currently has 96,348 staff members. The New York Times reported:\nBetween December 2ol6 and September 2ol8 — the date of the most recent data available from the federal Office of <span class=\"highlight\">Personnel</span> Management — the number of\ncorrectional officers fell more than ll%, from l9,o82 to l6,898. That decline reversed a longtime trend. Before President Doneld Trump tock office, the\nnumber of federal correctional officers had continuously increased: there were l2.5% more officers at the end of 2ol6 compared to the beginning of 2ol2.\nHawk Sawyer said the bureau has “made great progress\" to fill the over 3,3oo vacancies nationwide, but it is going to take a while. In order to hire more staff,\nthe bureau is working with the Office of <span class=\"highlight\">Personnel</span> Management to get direct hiring authority, hiring retirees on a temporary basis because they are already\n- \" trained and using the professional services company Accenture to recruit young people online.\nSawyer said the only thing that impedes the bureau from providing adequate care and services for inmates is resources. She expects the agency will receive\n$75 million in this year’s appropriations for the First Step Act, which the law requires for the first five years, although she hoped for more.

The charges in the Indictment stem from a fourteen-hour time period,\nfrom approximately 4:oo p.m. on August 9, 2ol9 to approximately 6:3o a.m. the follouing day,\nAugust lo, 2ol9, when the defendants were working as correctional officers at the MCC. As\ncharged in the Indictment, during that time period, the defendants failed to perform mandated\ncounts of prisoners housed in MCC’s Special Housing Unit (“SHU”), but nevertheless signed false\ncertifications atesting to having conducted those counts, when, in fact, no counts or rounds of the\nSHU were conducted from approximately lo:3o p.m. on August 9 to 6:3o a.m. on August lo.\nI. Pretrial Discovery and the Defendants’ Request for Additional Materials\n\nA. The Government’s Discovery Production\n\nAt the initial pretrial conference on November 25, 2ol9, the Court set a discovery deadline\nof December 3l, 2ol9. On that date, pursuant to a protective order entered by the Court, the\nGovernment made a substantial discovery production to both defendants, consisting in part of the\nfollouing: surveillance video for the common area of the SHU; analysis of the computers used by\nNoel and Thomas from August 9 to lo, 2ol9; count slips and thirty-minute round reports; MCC\nphone records; <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span> records and prior work schedules; and reports and notes of witness\ninterviews prepared by agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) and the DOJ-OIG\nwho were participating in the investigation.”\n\nSubsequently, the Government made three additional discovery productions, much more\nlimited in scope. On January 23, 2o2o, the Government produced additional interview reports and\n\n? The Government does not concede that production of all of the materials was required\nunder Rule l6, but nonetheless produced the materials in its possession out of an abundance of\ncaution.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o7o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022087.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 25 of 34\nGovernment; the BOP was not involved in the strategic decisions; and no BOP <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span>\naccompanied the prosecution to court proceedings.\n\nMoreover, even if the BOP had conducted a joint investigation with the Government into\nthe events of August 9 and lo, 2ol9 (which they did not), Thomas has offered no reason to believe\nthat most if not all of the records that he seeks—such as records of other instances of BOP\nemployees failing to conduct rounds and counts—would be part of the BOP’s investigation. There\nis simply no basis to seek an order compelling the Government to search for records in the\npossession of the BOP, without any temporal limitation or factual nexus to the charged case,\nregarding staffing shortages at the MCC, other instances where BOP employees failed to conduct\nrequired rounds and counts, and disciplinary records for other BOP employees who have at other\ntimes also allegedly falsified records.\n\nThe cases Thomas cites do not support a contrary result. In United States v. Bryan, the\nNinth Circuit concluded that the government could not limit its discovery obligations to documents\nlocated in the district of prosecution since the case came out of a single, nationwide IRS\ninvestigation. 868 F.2d lo32, lo35-37 (9th Cir. l989). In reaching that holding, the Circuit\nexplained that “a federal prosecutor need not comb the files of every federal agency which might\nhave documents regarding the defendant” and that Rule l6’s disclosure requirements are cabined\nto anything in the possession “of any federal agency participating in the same investigation of the\ndefendant.” /d. at lo36 (emphasis added). Similarly, in United States v. Volpe, 42 F. Supp. 2d\n2o4, 22l (E.D.N.Y. l999), the court explained, in denying the defendant’s discovery motion, that\n“TcJourts have construed the term ‘government’ . . . narrouly to mean the prosecutors in the\nparticular case or the governmental agencies jointly involved in the prosecution of the defendant,\nand not the ‘government’ in general.” And while the court in United States v.

In any event, even were the conduct similar,\nthat Thomas can point to but a single other instance in which officers were not criminally\nprosecuted for that type of conduct hardly rings of selectiveness.\n\nSimilarly, Thomas points to the fact that “Officer-l” and “Officer-2” in the Indictment,\nwho falsified count slips along with Tova Noel for the 4 p.m. and lo p.m. institutional counts on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, respectively, were not prosecuted. (Mot. lo; Ind. ¥[ l5, l7, l9). Even assuming\narguendo that Officer-l and Officer-2 were similarly situated to Thomas in that they each falsified\none count slip—while Thomas falsified three—Thomas has failed to put forth any evidence that\neither Officer-l or Officer-2 were outside of a “protected class” to which Thomas belongs.’ Nor\ncould he: Officer-l and Officer-2 are the same race, gender, and nationality as Thomas. Thomas\nalso questions why his supervisors or other MCC <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span> who received and reviewed Thomas’s\nfalse count slips were not also prosecuted with making false statements, but those supervisors or\n<span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span> are not similarly situated to Thomas because they did not actually make the false\nstatements—Thomas did. In addition, Courts have repeatedly held that the “suspicion [and]\nsurmise” contained in Thomas’s motion simply do not constitute “objective evidence” warranting\ndiscovery. See United States v. White, 972 F.2d l6, l9 (2d Cir. l992) (conclusory allegations as to\ntiming of indictment, Government’s failure to follou internal guidelines, and improprieties of\n\nT Tn so noting, the Government does not intend to comment on its deliberative process or\nthe exercise of its prosecutorial discretion. It notes these facts simply in response to Thomas’s\nclaim that the lack of charges against Officer-l, Officer-2, or Thomas’s supervisors is in and of\nitself sufficient to meet the defendant’s burden of establishing evidence of a similarly situated\ndefendant who was not charged.\n\na\nDOJ-OGR- ooo22o94\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022102.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 36 Filed o6/o9/2o Page6of9\nit has already delivered to Thomas all of the materials gathered by OIG <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span> in the course\nof investigating this case, and that “it is the prosecution’s understanding that [OIG] atorneys\nhave not conducted any additional interviews or otherwise discovered any potential Brady\nmaterial.” Jd. at 23-24. Thomas has not identified any specific material that might be in OIG’s\npossession that has not been disclosed.\n\nThe Court, therefore, has no basis to compel the Government to disclose additional\nevidence underlying the Inspector General’s report. “[C]ourts in this circuit have repeatedly\ndenied requests for discovery orders where the [G]overnment represents that it has produced\ndiscovery to defendants pursuant to Rule l6 and has made a good faith representation to the\ndefense that it recognizes and has complied with its obligations under Brady and its progeny.”\nUnited States v.

Feb. l5, 2ol8) (“The Government represents that it has complied with\nRule l6 obligations; the Rule l6 requests are therefore moot.” (citation omited)).\n\nAs for the draft Inspector General’s report itself, the Government reports that “atorneys\nfrom [OIG] responsible for writing the [r]eport have not yet completed a draft, and do not\nanticipate completing the [r]eport in the near term,” and so “there are no drafts of the [r]eport to\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22lo2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022103.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 36 Filed o6/o9/2o Page /7of9\ndisclose.” Gov’t Opp. at 2l-22.

Motion at 6. Houever, Thomas has adduced no evidence that the\nGovernment reviewed information arising from a BOP investigation. Nor has he shoun that\nBOP officials “participated in the prosecution’s witness interviews,” were “involved in\npresenting the case to the grand jury,” “reviewed documents gathered by or shared documents\nwith the prosecution,” “played a role in the development of prosecutorial strategy,”\n“accompanied the prosecution to court proceedings,” or in any other way played a role in the\ninvestigation that led to the charges against him. Collins, 4o9 F. Supp. 3d at 239 (internal\nquotation marks, citation, and alteration omited).

Many of\nthose same operational challenges, including staffing\nshortages, managing inmates at risk for suicide,\nfunctional security camera systems, and management\nfailures and widespread disregard of BOP policies and\nprocedures, were again identified by the OIG during\nthis investigation and review into the custody, care, and\nsupervision of one of the BOP’s most notorious\ninmates, Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe OIG initiated this investigation upon receipt of\ninformation from the BOP that on August lo, 2ol9, in\nthe Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York,\nNew York (MCC New York), Epstein was found hanged\nin his assigned cell within the Special Housing Unit\n(SHU). The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner,\n\nCity of New York, determined that Epstein had died\nby suicide.\n\nThe OIG conducted this investigation jointly with the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), with the OIG’s\ninvestigative focus being the conduct of BOP <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span>.\nAmong other things, the FBI investigated the cause of\nEpstein’s death and determined there was no\ncriminality pertaining to hou Epstein had died.\n\nThis report concerns the OIG's findings regarding MCC\nNew York <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span>'s custody, care, and supervision of\nEpstein while detained at the facility from his arrest on\nfederal sex trafficking charges on July 6, 2ol9, until his\ndeath on August lo.\n\nEpstein is Assigned to the SHU on July 7\n\nEpstein was assigned to a cell in the SHU on July 7 due\nto media coverage of his case and inmate awareness of\nhis notoriety. SHU inmates are securely separated\nfrom general population inmates and kept locked in\ntheir cells for approximately 23 hours a day.\n\nBOP policy requires SHU staff to observe all inmates at\nleast twice an hour and that Lieutenants conduct at\nleast one round in the SHU each shift.

Notice on August 8 of the Impending Transfer of Epstein’s Cellmate on August 9\nAs noted above, since July 3o, consistent with the Psychology Department's determination that Epstein\nneeded to have a cellmate, Epstein had been housed with Inmate 3, whom the Warden and the Federal\nBureau of Prisons (BOP) executive leadership had selected as an appropriate cellmate. At lo:33 a.m. on\nAugust 8, 2ol9, the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) sent an email to MCC New York <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span> assigned to\nReceiving and Discharge, the area within the Correctional Services Department that is responsible for\nprocessing inmates who enter or leave the facility, with the subject “Transfer of Prisoners from NYM [MCC\nNew York] to GEO.” The body of the email identified Inmate 3 as one of the prisoners to be transferred\nand further stated, “Please schedule the transfer for Friday 8/9/l9.”\nAt 3:36 p.m. on the same day, the USMS sent a second email to a number of MCC New York <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span>,\nincluding Associate Warden 2, the Captain, the SHU Lieutenant, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, the\nDay Watch Activities Lieutenant, the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, another Lieutenant, and the\nSpecial Investigative Services Lieutenant, with the subject “Prisoner Production o8-o9-2ol9.” This email\ncontained two atachments, one of which was the Prisoner Schedule Report for MCC New York for August 9,\n2ol9. The first page of this atachment reflects that Inmate 3 was scheduled to be transferred from MCC\nNew York to GEO (Queens Detention Facility) on August 9, 2ol9. This atachment also includes the acronym\n“WAB\" within the Destination/Description portion of the document, which MCC New York <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span> told the\nOIG means “with all belongings.” During their OIG interviews, MCC New York staff members further\nexplained that the “WAB” notation meant that Inmate 3 was being permanently removed from MCC\nNew York on August 9, 2ol9. Notwithstanding this email, as detailed belou, several of the email recipients\nidentified above, including the Captain, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, and the Day Watch Activities\nLieutenant told the OIG that they believed Inmate 3 had gone to court on August 9, and they did not knou\nhe had been transferred to another facility.\n\nB.

Forensic Psychologist l explained to the atorney\nthat because Epstein was housed in the SHU and he was a sex offender, he needed to have a cellmate.\nAdditionally, the OIG investigation revealed that on the day of Epstein’s death, a Supervisory Staff Atorney\nwith the BOP’s Consolidated Legal Center for New York, sent an email to the Warden to inform him that on\nthe previous day (August 9, 2ol9), two of Epstein’s atorneys separately contacted him. One of the atorneys\nasked for Epstein to be moved to a different, specific housing unit within MCC New York; the other atorney\nasked for Epstein to be housed without a cellmate in the SHU.

Removal on August 9 of Epstein’s Cellmate from MCC New York\nAccording to MCC New York reports, including the Daily Log and the Lieutenant’s Log, on August 9, 2ol9, at\napproximately 8:38 a.m., Epstein’s cellmate, Inmate 3, was “pre-removed” and transferred out of MCC\nNew York in a routine, pre-arranged transfer. The Daily Log tracks inmate movements throughout MCC\nNew York each day, while MCC New York Lieutenants utilize the Lieutenant's Log to document the daily\nactivities that took place within the institution during their respective shifts.\nThe Supervisory Correctional Systems Specialist was the supervisor of Receiving and Discharge on August 9,\n2ol9, and was responsible for overseeing all inmate movements in and out of the institution that day. The\nSupervisory Correctional Systems Specialist verified that Receiving and Discharge would have used the\nUSMS emails sent on August 8, 2ol9, to coordinate Inmate 3’s transfer out MCC New York, and since\nInmate 3 was listed as “WAB” on the USMS emails, that meant he was being transferred from the facility and\nnot coming back. She explained to the OIG that if Inmate 3 had been going to court, as many pretrial\ninmates held at MCC New York often did, the Daily Log would have reflected “court,” rather than “pre-\nremove.” Since the Daily Log listed Inmate 3 as “pre-remove,” the Receiving and Discharge <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span> who\nentered the information into the report were made aware that Inmate 3 was being transferred from MCC\nNew York on or before the morning of August 9, 2ol9. The Supervisory Correctional Systems Specialist told\nthe OIG that the language in the USMS emails (“WAB,” i.e., “with all belongings”) and MCC New York reports\n(“pre-removed”) made it clear that Inmate 3 would not be returning to the SHU or MCC New York.\nThe OIG also interviewed the Correctional Systems Officer, who was the Receiving and Discharge officer who\nhandled inmate movement in and out of MCC New York on August 9, 2ol9. The Correctional Systems\nOfficer confirmed that the Daily Log reflected that Inmate 3 was “pre-removed” on August 9, 2ol9, at\n8:38 a.m., because he was being officially moved from the institution to another prison. She explained to\nthe OIG that the ordinary process was that Receiving and Discharge <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span> would enter the information\nregarding Inmate 3 into SENTRY, along with information pertaining to other inmates who would be leaving\ntheir MCC New York housing units. Receiving and Discharge used this information to create the daily call\nout list, which had all of the inmates’ names and times that they were to be moved. The Correctional\nSystems Officer told the OIG that the call out list from August 9, 2ol9, was no longer available because the\ncall out lists were printed and hand-delivered to the housing units each day, and then discarded by the units\nat the end of the day. She also said each day’s call out list was only maintained electronically for a 24-hour\nperiod, and then it was updated (overwriten) with the next day's list. In her OIG interview, the Correctional\nSystems Officer explained what would have occurred on this date based on her experience. Receiving and\nDischarge <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span> would have printed copies of the call out list for August 9, 2ol9, which the MCC\nNew York internal officer would distribute to the various housing units within the facility. Based on the\nother records reflecting Inmate 3's transfer, the Correctional Systems Officer said the call out list created for\nAugust 9, 2ol9, would have listed “WAB” next to Inmate 3’s name, which meant that he was departing from\nthe institution and not returning.\nCorrectional Officer (CO) l told the OIG that on the morning of August 9, 2ol9, he and Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge escorted Inmate 3 to Receiving and Discharge and Epstein to his legal visit.\n52\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023438.jpg": ".

Thomas then louered Epstein’s entire body to\nthe floor and, because he did not believe Epstein was\n. breathing, Thomas immediately began providing chest\ncompressions until responding MCC New York staff members\narrived approximately l minute later.

Thomas said medical <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span> took\n| over the emergency response, including chest compressions\nand use of an automated external defibrillator (AED), when\nthey arrived. Thomas said he assisted with bringing Epstein\ndoun to the Health Services Unit on the second floor, and\nthat he left MCC New York at approximately 8 a.m. Thomas\nsaid he had received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\ntraining during MCC New York annual refresher training and\nhad responded to medical emergencies in the past, but this\nwas the first time he was the first responder.\nSource: Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, Thomas said he was present in the SHU for his entire shift on\nCity of New York August lo, 2ol9, from l2 a.m. until the time he atempted to\ndeliver breakfast to Epstein at approximately 6:3o a.m. and\ndid not see anyone go inside Epstein’s cell during his shift. Thomas said that he would have knoun if\nsomeone went in or out of Epstein’s cell and said no one did. Thomas told the OIG that he could see\nEpstein’s cell door from the SHU Officers’ Station, but he could not see inside the cell from that vantage\npoint. Thomas said that it was not possible for anyone to have entered the SHU without his knouledge\nbecause he or Noel would have had to open the SHU door for anyone to gain entry. The only other key to\nthe SHU was located elsewhere in the institution; no other MCC New York staff members had the keys\nrequired to gain access to the SHU. Moreover, Thomas said that anyone atempting to access the L Tier\nwhere Epstein was located would have had to walk directly in front of the SHU Officers’ Station where\nThomas was seated, and no one did. Thomas denied that he or Noel had any role in Epstein’s death.\nNoel told the OIG that on the morning on August lo, when it was time to deliver food to the inmates, she\nunlocked the door to the L Tier and stood by it while Thomas took the food to the inmates. Noel said that\nwhen Thomas knocked on Epstein’s door, there was no response. Noel said Epstein’s cell door was locked,\nso Thomas used a key to open it and went inside.

As the OIG has noted in numerous prior reports regarding the BOP’s camera system, BOP staff and\ninmates are aware of where prison cameras are located and often engage in wrongdoing in locations where\nthey knou cameras are not located.°® Additionally, the OIG did not observe on the recorded video of the\nSHU common area that Noel and Thomas, who were seated at the desk at the SHU Officers’ Station\nimmediately outside the L tier during that time period, at any time rose from their seats or approached the\nL Tier. We additionally found that Thomas's and Noel's reaction on the morning of August lo upon finding\nEpstein hanging in his cell, as described to us by Thomas, Noel, the responding Lieutenant, and inmates,\nwas consistent with their being unaware of any potential harm to Epstein prior to Thomas entering Epstein’s\ncell at about 6:3o a.m. on August lo.\nWe further noted that Epstein had previously been placed on suicide watch and psychological observation\ndue to the events of July 23, 2ol9; that numerous nooses made from prison bed sheets were found in his\ncell on the morning of August lo; and that he had signed a new Last Will and Testament on August 8, 2 days\nbefore he died. No weapons were recovered from Epstein’s cell after his death. Additionally, the inmates\nwho were interviewed consistently reported that on the evening Epstein died the SHU staff did not\nsystematically conduct the required rounds and counts, which was one of the primary mechanisms for the\nSHU staff to ensure the safety and security of inmates housed in the SHU. Asa result, Epstein was\nunmonitored and locked alone in his cell for hours with an excess amount of linens, which provided an\nopportunity for him to commit suicide.\nFinally, the Medical Examiner who performed the autopsy detailed for the OIG why Epstein’s injuries were\nmore consistent with, and indicative of, a suicide by hanging rather than a homicide by strangulation. The\nMedical Examiner also told the OIG that the ligature furrou was too broad to have been caused by the\nelectrical cord of the medical device in Epstein’s cell and that blood toxicology tests revealed no medications\nor illegal substances were in Epstein’s system. The Medical Examiner also noted the absence of debris\nunder Epstein’s fingernails, marks on his hands, contusions to his knuckles, or bruises on his body that\nwould have indicated Epstein had been a struggle, which would be expected if Epstein’s death had been a\nhomicide by strangulation.\nThis is not the first time that the OIG has found significant job performance and management failures on\nthe part of BOP <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span> and widespread disregard of BOP policies that are designed to ensure that\ninmates are safe, secure, and in good health. For instance, the OIG’s December 2o22 investigation and\nreview of the BOP’s handling of the transfer of James “Whitey” Bulger identified serious job performance and\n56 U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) OIG, Notification of Needed Upgrades to the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Security Camera\nSystem, Management Advisory Memorandum 22-ool (October 2o2l); U.S. DOJ OIG, Audit of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’\nManagement and Oversight of its Chaplaincy Services Program, 2l-o9l (July 2o2l); U.S. DOJ OIG, Review of the Federal\nBureau of Prisons’ Contraband Interdiction Efforts, Evaluation and Inspections Report l6-o5 (June 2ol6).\n\n96\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23463\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023464.jpg": "management failures at multiple levels within the BOP.*” Similar to the Bulger report, the numerous and\nserious transgressions that occurred in this mater came to light largely because they involved a high-profile\ninmate. The fact that serious deficiencies occurred in connection with high-profile inmates like Epstein and\nBulger is especially concerning given that the BOP would presumably take particular care in handling the\ncustody and care of such inmates.\nRegretably, the OIG has encountered similar issues on many other occasions. For example, the OIG has\ninvestigated numerous allegations related to the falsification of official BOP documentation concerning\ninmate counts and rounds, several of which have resulted in criminal prosecution. The OIG currently has\ntwo open investigations into allegations of falsified inmate count and round documentation, each involving\nan inmate death (by suicide and homicide) or escape from a BOP facility.\nThis investigation and review also revealed the direct impact of insufficient staffing levels on inmate safety.\nWitnesses repeatedly told the OIG that counts, rounds, cell searches, and other methods of inmate\naccountability were not undertaken because correctional staff were working multiple shifts—including one\nstaff member who worked 24-hours straight—and were tired and overwhelmed with other duties. As\ndiscussed in greater detail in our recommendations, the OIG has repeatedly found the need for BOP to\naddress staffing shortages. Most recently, in March 2o23, the OIG found that the coronavirus disease 2ol9\n(COVID-l9) pandemic exacerbated the effects of preexisting BOP medical and nonmedical staffing\nshortages, an issue the OIG has identified as a concern for the BOP since at least 2ol5.°°\nFurther, the OIG has repeatedly found that BOP <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span> have not consistently been atentive to the needs\nof inmates at risk for suicide. In this investigation, that inatention manifested in the failure of MCC\nNew York staff and supervisors to ensure that Epstein was assigned a cellmate as required by the MCC\nNew York Psychology Department directive issued after the July 23, 2ol9 incident in which Epstein was\ndiscovered in his cell with an orange cloth around his neck. In a March 2o23 report, the OIG found that BOP\npsychology staff did not assess the suitability of single-cell assignments for five of the seven inmates who\ndied by suicide while in COVID-l9 quarantine units between March 2o2o and April 2o2l.°? The OIG’s 2ol7\nreport on the BOP’s use of restrictive housing for inmates with mental illness also noted that single-celling\nmay present risks to inmate mental health, and both of the recommendations from that report regarding\nthe use and oversight of single-celling remain open as of March 2o23.\nLastly, as discussed in greater detail in the conclusions and recommendations that follou, the persistent\ndeficiencies of the BOP’s security camera systems are well documented and long-standing.\n57 U.S. DOJ OIG, Investigation and Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Handling of the Transfer of Inmate James “Whitey”\nBulger, 23-oo7 (December 2o22).\n*8 U.S. DOJ OIG, Capstone Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Response to the Coronavirus Disease 2ol9 Pandemic,\nEvaluation and Inspections Division A-2o2o-oll (March 2o23) (Capstone Report).\n5° Capstone Report.\n6 U.S. DOJ OIG, Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Use of Restrictive Housing for Inmates with Mental Illness, Evaluation\nand Inspections Report l7-o5 (July 2ol7).\n\n97\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23464\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023465.jpg": "The combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance failures documented in this\nreport all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most notorious inmates in BOP’s\ncustody was provided with the opportunity to take his oun life, resulting in significant questions being asked\nabout the circumstances of his death, hou it could have been alloued to have happen, and most\nimportantly, depriving his numerous victims, many of whom were underage girls at the time of the alleged\ncrimes, of their ability to seek justice through the criminal justice process. The fact that these failures have\nbeen recurring ones at the BOP does not excuse them and gives additional urgency to the need for\nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) and BOP leadership to address the chronic staffing, surveillance, security, and\nrelated problems plaguing the BOP.\nThe OIG has completed its investigation and is providing this report to the BOP for appropriate action.\nUnless otherwise noted, the OIG applies the preponderance of the evidence standard in determining\nwhether DOJ <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span> have commited misconduct.

MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that Epstein Had a Cellmate on August 9 as\n\nInstructed by the Psychology Department on July 3o\nOn July 3o, 2ol9, the MCC New York Psychology Department sent an email to over 7o BOP staff members\nstating that Epstein “needs to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.” The Psychology Department's\ndirective that Epstein have an appropriate cellmate arose out of the events that occurred on July 23, 2ol9,\nwhen Epstein was found lying on the floor of his cell with a piece of orange cloth around his neck. Epstein’s\ncellmate at the time (Inmate l) told MCC New York staff that Epstein had tried to hang himself, and another\ninmate housed on the same SHU tier at the time (Inmate 2) corroborated several aspects of Inmate l's\naccount. Epstein’s accounts of what had occurred varied. Epstein initially told MCC New York staff that he\nthought his cellmate had tried to kill him, but thereafter he repeatedly said he did not knou what had\noccurred. Epstein later asked two different MCC New York staff members if he could be housed with the\nsame cellmate Epstein initially accused of having tried to harm him.\nAs a result of this incident, Epstein was placed on suicide watch and then psychological observation.\nConsistent with the Psychology Department's directive, the Captain and the SHU Lieutenant each told the\nOIG that they verbally informed SHU staff of Epstein’s cellmate requirement. These and other witnesses\nsaid staff members regularly assigned to the SHU knew that Epstein needed to have a cellmate. Houever,\ndespite the Psychology Department's widely disseminated July 3o email instruction and the subsequent\nverbal direction provided by the Captain and the SHU Lieutenant, Epstein was left without a cellmate on\nAugust 9 and, less than 24 hours later, Epstein died by suicide.\nl. Failure to Make Required Notifications Regarding the Need to Assign Epstein a\nNew Cellmate\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed that on August 9, 2ol9, MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU\nfailed to notify their superiors that Epstein’s cellmate, Inmate 3, had been transferred out of MCC New York\nand therefore Epstein needed to be assigned a new cellmate.

MCC New York Staff Failed to Conduct Mandatory Rounds and Inmate Counts\nResulting in Epstein Being Unobserved for Hours Before His Death\nThe OIG’s investigation and review revealed that on August 9 and lo, 2ol9, MCC New York SHU staff did not\nconduct the mandatory rounds and inmate counts during their shift in the SHU. The failure to undertake\nthese required measures to account for inmate whereabouts and wellbeing—and the supervisors’ failure to\nproperly supervise the SHU staff, as discussed further belou—resulted in Epstein being unobserved for\nhours before his death, which compounded the failure of MCC New York staff to ensure that Epstein had an\nappropriate cellmate.\nl. Failure to Conduct Rounds and Inmate Counts in the SHU\nFederal regulations require that employees “use official time in an honest effort to perform official duties.””!\nAdditionally, BOP standards of conduct required that employees “[c]onduct themselves in a manner that\nfosters respect for the Bureau of Prisons, the Department of Justice, and the U.S. Government.””* Because\n“[i]Jnatention to duty in a correctional environment can result in escapes, assaults, and other incidents,”\nBOP standards of conduct also require employees “to remain fully alert and atentive during duty hours.”\nBOP policy also requires “[c]ontinuous inmate accountability,” which is accomplished through rounds and\ninmate counts.’”? Among other things, rounds and inmate counts enable staff to observe inmates and\nensure that they are safe and secure in their cells and are in good health.\nBOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders set out the requirements for these inmate accountability\nmeasures, specifying that correctional staff must conduct rounds on an irregular schedule at least twice\neach hour, no more than 4o minutes apart. BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders further specify\nthat at least two MCC New York SHU staff members must conduct inmate counts at l2 a.m., 3.a.m.,5a.m.,\n4 p.m., and lo p.m. daily, and also at lo a.m. on weekends and federal holidays.\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed that an inmate (Inmate 4) was internally transferred from the\nSHU to Receiving and Discharge at approximately 3:l5 p.m. on August 9, 2ol9; houever, this inmate transfer\nwas not documented until approximately l2:35 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9. Based on this internal transfer,\nBOP records, and witness statements, the OIG determined that the 4 p.m. and lo p.m. SHU inmate counts\non August 9 were erroneous. In addition, the OIG reviewed the available SHU security camera video, which\ndid not shou COs walking up or doun the stairs leading to the various SHU tiers during the count times, a\nprocess that is necessary to conduct an accurate count of inmates.”* During their OIG interviews, the\nEvening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Material Handler, CO Tova Noel, and Material Handler Michael\nThomas each admited that they did not conduct all of the mandatory rounds and inmate counts in the SHU\n™ 5 C.F.R. § 2635.7o5(a); see also 5 C.F.R. 8 2635.lol(b)(5).\n7 BOP Program Statement 342o.ll.\n® BOP Program Statement 55oo.l4.\n™ As discussed in Chapter 5, the OIG found that the security camera video was of lou quality.

The Evening Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he and other staff members did not conduct any cell searches\nduring his shift in the SHU on August 9. Additionally, the OIG determined that there was an excessive\namount of bed linen within Epstein’s cell. The Captain reviewed photographs of Epstein’s cell and told the\nOIG that the excessive linens were a security issue because they could give inmates materials to fashion an\nimprovised noose or use as escape paraphernalia.\nThe OIG found that on August 9, 2ol9, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge either failed to conduct the\nrequired cell searches or failed to document the cell searches that he conducted in the SHU, and that the\nEvening Watch SHU Officer in Charge failed to ensure that MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU\nconducted cell searches and himself failed to log cell searches in violation of BOP policy and MCC New York\nSHU Post Orders. Additionally, the OIG found that it was a performance failure for the Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, and Noel, who served as the SHU Officer in\nCharge during their respective shifts on August 9 and lo, 2ol9, to have permited Epstein to have an\nexcessive amount of linens in his cell.\n\nE. MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that the Institution’s Security Camera\n\nSystem was Fully Functional Resulting in Limited Recorded Video Evidence\nThis investigation and review revealed longstanding deficiencies with MCC New York's security camera\nsystem. These deficiencies resulted in nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU where Epstein was\nbeing housed to not record video starting in late July 2ol9 and continuing through the date of Epstein’s\ndeath on August lo, 2ol9. According to forensic analysis conducted by the FBI after Epstein’s death, on\nJuly 29, 2ol9, a disk failure in MCC New York's DVR 2 system caused approximately half of the institution's\ncameras—including nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU—to display only a live video feed with\nno video recording. MCC New York <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span> did not learn of this system failure until ll days later on\nAugust 8, 2ol9. MCC New York <span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span> determined that the DVR 2 system needed to be rebuilt to restore\nrecording functionality. Despite the lack of recording functionality, this repair was not completed until after\nEpstein’s death.\nThe Warden told the OIG that he was generally aware that there were problems with the camera system.\nThe Warden sought and received approval from BOP to replace the entire camera system and in\nSeptember 2ol8, BOP entered into contracts totaling over $73o,ooo to purchase new equipment for the\ncamera replacement project. Although MCC New York management procured new DVR components\napproximately 9 months prior to Epstein’s death, the new system was not installed in a timely manner. The\nnew cameras required new conduit and wiring to be installed before the camera installation. Management\nfaced staffing shortages, temporary rotating facility managers, and other competing priorities that did not\nallou for completion of the installation of the wiring or the new camera system. The OIG determined that as\nof August 2o2l—nearly 3 years after MCC New York contracted for replacement camera equipment—the\nsystem upgrade still had not been completed.*’\n87 The BOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2o2l due to substandard conditions that are unrelated to this\ninvestigation and review.\nlo9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23476\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023484.jpg": "OIG Official Draft Report: BOP’s Care, Custody, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at MCC New York,\nNew York\nJune 22, 2o23\nPage 3 of 3\nBOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation.\nRecommendation Four: The BOP should evaluate its methods of accounting for inmate\nwhereabouts and wellbeing and make changes as may be appropriate to improve those methods\nthrough policy, training, or other measures.\nBOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation.\nRecommendation Five: BOP policy should clarify what is required of a lieutenant when\nconducting a round.\nBOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation.\nRecommendation Six: The BOP should continue to develop and implement plans to address\nstaffing shortages at its prisons.\nBOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation.

Horouitz announced today the release of a report\nof investigation regarding the Federal Bureau of Prison’s (BOP) custody, care, and supervision of Jeffrey\nEpstein while detained at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, New York (MCC New\nYork).

Follouing a July 23,\n2ol9, incident that resulted in Epstein being placed on suicide watch, the MCC New York\nPsychology Department determined that Epstein needed to be housed with an appropriate\ncellmate. On August 9, Epstein’s cell mate was transferred out of MCC New York. MCC New York\nstaff knew that Epstein did not have a cellmate but did not take steps to ensure that he was\nassigned a new cellmate.\n\no MCC New York Staff Failed to Undertake Required Measures Designed to Ensure that Epstein\nand Other Inmates Were Accounted for and Safe. BOP policy requires Special Housing Unit\n(SHU) staff to observe all inmates, conduct rounds, conduct inmate counts, search inmate cells,\nand ensure adequate supervision of the SHU. BOP staff in the SHU in the hours before Epstein’s\ndeath failed to carry out these responsibilities. Specifically, only one SHU cell search was\ndocumented on August 9, and it was not of Epstein’s cell. BOP records did not indicate when\nEpstein’s cell was last searched. Had Epstein's cell been searched as required, the search would\nhave revealed that Epstein had excess prison blankets, linens, and clothing in his cell. The OIG\nalso found that SHU staff did not conduct any 3o-minute rounds after about lo:4o p.m. on\nAugust 9 and that none of the required SHU inmate counts were conducted after 4:oo p.m. on\nAugust 9. MCC New York staff falsified count slips and round sheets to shou that they had been\nperformed when they were not, leaving Epstein unobserved for hours before his\ndeath. Follouing a DOJ OIG investigation, two MCC New York employees were charged\ncriminally with falsifying BOP records. The charges were dismissed upon compliance by the\nemployees with the terms of deferred prosecution agreements they entered into with the U.S.\nAtorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.

The DOJ OIG has repeatedly identified long-standing\noperational challenges that negatively affect the BOP’s ability to operate its institutions safely and\nsecurely. Many of those same operational challenges, including staffing shortages, managing\ninmates at risk for suicide, maintaining functional security camera systems, management failures,\nand widespread disregard of BOP policies and procedures, were again identified by the OIG during\nthis investigation and review of the custody, care, and supervision of Epstein, one of the BOP’s most\nhigh profile inmates.\n\ne No Evidence Contradicting the FBI's Determination that there Was No Criminality Associated with\nEpstein’s Death. Separate from the OIG's investigation, which focused on the conduct of BOP\n<span class=\"highlight\">personnel</span>, the FBI concurrently investigated whether Epstein’s death was the result of criminal\nconduct by any non-BOP actors. Among other things, the FBI investigated the cause of Epstein’s\ndeath and determined it was not the result of a criminal act. The Office of the Chief Medical\nExaminer, City of New York, determined that Epstein died by suicide.

Any inconsistencies noted in the logbooks by Psychology staff will be reported immediately to the Captain\nand the Associate Warden over Programs to address appropriately.\nThe Operations Lieutenant will physically check the PP3o Cell Assignment Roster when inmates are quartered on\nsuicide watch. The Lieutenant will ensure the Counts and Assignments (C&A) Officer keys cell assignments\ncorrectly and annotate any errors in the daily log and contact the Captain immediately. Guidance was sent to the\nLieutenants regarding keying of suicide watch bed assignments after hours. The Lieutenants were instructed that\nupon placing an inmate on suicide watch, they are responsible for contacting C&A and providing the cell\nassignment. Additionally, the Lieutenant will run a PP3o with the selection category for suicide watch. The\nOperations Lieutenant will email the roster to the Captain, as he will be responsible for verifying that each inmate is\nin the appropriate cell. This verification process will ensure inmates placed on suicide watch are keyed into accurate\nbed assignments and will eliminate inmates being keyed into the same cell.\nAdditionally, the Lieutenants were instructed to contact the Captain and on-call Psychology statf by telephone when\nthe need for suicide watch placement is determined after hours. Psychology staff have been instructed to contact the\nWarden upon receiving said notification. After consultation with the Warden, Psychology staff will designate\nwhether a staff or inmate companion will be assigned. Psychology staff will in turn inform the Shift Lieutenant of\nthis determination.\nTo ensure inmates are assigned to the correct cell inside the Special Housing Unit, periodic and unannounced checks\nare conducted. Specifically, SENTRY Roster PP3o Quarters assignments are audited daily by the SHU Lieutenant.\nExecutive Staff also conduct routine bed book counts in all units. Any and all discrepancies identified are addressed.\nResults will be maintained by Correctional services in the Lieutenants Log. The Morning Watch Lieutenant is\nresponsible for observing one count during his or her shift in SHU which is documented daily in the Lieutenants\nLog.\nIn order to properly account for inmates in the unit, staff have been informed not use the Inmate Locator Form, due\nto the forms being unreliable in accounting for inmates and cell assignments. A Unit Accountability Board along\nwith a SENTRY PP3o Quarters Roster have been placed in the unit to establish beter oversight over inmate\naccountability.\nCorrectional Staff are required to perform routine rounds of the second floor suicide watch area every hour. On Day\nwatch, Monday through Friday, the 2 Sally Officers are required to perform rounds on suicide watch inmates, as\nprescribed by the Captain. After hours, the Unit 2 Officer will be responsible for making rounds, serving meals,\ncollecting trash in the area, and performing the count with the Internal l or Internal 2 Officer assisting with duties as\nassigned by the Captain. To ensure that staff are informed of the importance of Suicide Prevention and\nresponsibilities when one occurs. Lieutenants will reinforce the message through conference calls with staff. Roll\nCall notes will be placed on TRUSCOPE to notify staff of which inmates are currently on suicide watch.\n9. Atorney Log Books: Four log books were not secured follouing Mr. Epstein's death. Specifically, three Atorney\nLog Books located in the Atorney Visiting and Front Lobby areas and an Inmate Search Log Book located in the\nAtorney Visiting area were not secured.
